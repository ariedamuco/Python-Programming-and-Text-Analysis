Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is an important part of the legislative process that the public rarely gets a chance to see. I am talking about the many dedicated staff people, on both sides of the aisle, who work tirelessly to help the Senate conduct the Nation's business. They work hard. They are dedicated. They provide invaluble advice and counsel on a daily basis. 
Today, I rise to pay tribute to one of these remarkable people. Kyle McSlarrow, my Chief of Staff in the Republican Conference Secretary's office, will be leaving my office to run Vice President Dan Quayle's presidential campaign in Arizona. While I couldn't be happier about Kyle's new opportunity to shape the politics of a presidential campaign, I am sad to lose such a talented individual. But most of all, I am sad that such a good friend will be leaving. 
For the last several years, Kyle has been an integral part of the Senate Republican leadership team. He provided his counsel to two Majority Leaders--Senator Dole and Senator Lott--before coming to work as my Chief of Staff in the Conference Secretary's office. Kyle has helped set the strategy for all the major legislative issues we have brought to the Senate floor. He has provided his insight not only to our leadership, but also to many other Senators in our conference who have come to rely on his good judgement. 
Kyle McSlarrow is a conservative with the strongest of convictions. He has always been able to get the job done, while holding steadfast to these principles. Kyle has a great deal to be proud of in the years he has worked on Capitol Hill: helping to rein in the IRS, working to reduce illegal drugs in our communities and helping to craft a blueprint for education reform that will one day be the law of this land. But most importantly, Capitol Hill is where Kyle met his wife Alison. 
Kyle's better half, Alison McSlarrow, will be leaving the majority leader's office where she has served with great distinction for the past few years as Deputy Chief of Staff. Alison is one of the brightest staffers I have met in Washington. Her intricate knowledge of Senate parliamentary procedure and legislative issues will be sorely missed. I greatly appreciate all the help she has been to me over the years and will miss her dearly, as well. 
So I say to my friends Kyle and Alison, best of luck in Arizona. You have made a difference here. You will make a difference wherever you may be. The Nation needs caring and dedicated people like you to always be involved in the process. God speed. The best for you both is yet to come.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is with great concern that I rise to address a recurring problem in my state with the United States Postal Service. It seems that we are continually faced with situations where the Postal Service has created controversy by indicating--in some cases--that they will move existing post offices from downtown areas. In Georgia, as in many states, these post offices have been main street fixtures for residents, creating a meeting place for shoppers, business people and officials. The idea of moving these post offices is particularly worrisome for rural areas where local merchants have long relied upon this common bond. It is a problem that Congress should examine in order to work with the Postal Service to promote a better understanding and working relationship with the affected communities. 
We currently have a particular case in Newnan, Georgia which illustrates the problem. After receiving word from the community that the post office was moving out of the downtown area, we began contact with the Postal Service to determine whether or not these rumors were true. We gained assurances from the Postal Service that they did not intend to move from the downtown area because there was `overwhelming community support' for keeping it there. Since that time, we have received another report from the Postal Service that, because of security requirements, they indeed may have to move to an alternate location. I am concerned by the lack of clarity in the reports my office has received on this matter and am working to get a clarification from the Postal Service. I would like to reiterate for the record my commitment to maintaining a full service postal facility in downtown Newnan. I would welcome the opportunity to work with local officials and businesses in Newnan and the Postal Service to meet this goal. 
As I mentioned, Mr. President, this matter in Newnan is a reflection of the work we have ahead to avoid these controversies between smaller communities and the post office. It is a problem I hope we rectify favorably for the citizens of Newnan in this case, and for people all over America in the future.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I join Senator Coats and Senator McCain in submitting a Senate Resolution renouncing the recent proposal by the Administration to expand methadone maintenance programs. Methadone is a so-called `treatment' for heroin addiction. Heroin is a highly addictive opiate which leads its users down a path of crime and self-destruction, and the prescription of methadone is simply a means to sustain addiction. My colleagues and I do realize the need for help, but do not believe the answer is exchanging one addiction for another. 
The Administration has failed to consult Congress of its plan to increase the number of methadone maintenance programs and to loosen regulations of licensed methadone dispensers. We frown upon the idea of paying for drug addiction. Our Resolution states the need for Congressional hearings in order to compare the Administration's proposal with alternative drug-free treatment programs. 
Alternatives such as the Ready, Willing and Able program have been extremely successful in helping Americans who are addicted to drugs, homeless, or in many cases, both. This program is based on community. It provides wages earned from community based jobs in exchange for room, board and positive reinforcement in a drug-free environment. I believe comprehensive treatment programs such as this are a positive step in our war against drugs. 
America will have achieved nothing in the fight against drugs if we keep funding programs that allow us to look the other way without looking at the facts. We need to hear from those who are methadone users, those who are previous methadone users, and those who administer methadone. We need to look at statistics, look at current funding, and look at current problems within the programs. I don't believe we have solved anyone's drug addiction if we can still call them an addict. Methadone users are addicts and they face the same withdrawals as those on heroin. Let's find solutions to our Nation's drug problems, not follow the Administration's example, which further feeds and funds drug addiction.

Is that correct?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for prostate cancer research, and to thank Senator Stevens and my other colleagues for their leadership on this important issue. While I am pleased with the strides this Congress has made in funding research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), I share the concern that the allocation of NIH funds may be done in a manner disproportionate to a disease's severity and occurrence. I understand that prostate cancer research is one of those areas. Without discounting the NIH's other meritorious pursuits, I nevertheless wish to offer my support for assuring a larger allocation of NIH funding to prostate cancer research. It is my hope that as the appropriations process continues, the negotiators will give fair and appropriate consideration to the Senate's $175 million earmark for prostate cancer research.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today the Senate passed H.R. 2614, the Reading Excellence Act, and I rise in celebration for the many Americans this important legislation will help. Reading is critical to every aspect of life, especially as we move into the high-tech world of the 21st century. With the passage of this bill, more Americans will secure the basic reading skills necessary to enjoy the benefits of citizenship. It will enable many to do some of the things we take for granted--being able to read a phone book, a dinner menu, directions on a medicine bottle, or a job application. 
Right now, only 4 out of 10 of our Nation's third graders can read at grade level or above. This clearly can not stand. Our goal is to ensure that every child is able to read by the third grade. This bill is a down payment toward that goal. The Reading Excellence Act focuses on scientifically based methods for teaching reading, it provides for tutorial assistance for at-risk children, and addresses adult illiteracy so that parents can be their children's first and most important teacher. This bill stresses the basics, a return to proven teaching methods, and most importantly a return to methods that work. It is unacceptable that only 10 percent of our teachers have received formal instruction on how to teach reading. Reading Excellence will give our educators the resources needed to prepare our children to read before they advance to the next grade. 
With the leadership of Chairman William F. Goodling, H.R. 2614 passed the House last year. Earlier this year Reading Excellence was included in our Senate Republican blueprint for education reform. I also offered Reading Excellence, S. 1596, as a freestanding bill in the Senate on February 2, 1998. Again, in an effort to pass this legislation, I offered it as an amendment to my education savings accounts bill and it was agreed to unanimously. Unfortunately, the President killed that comprehensive education reform bill, vetoing the literacy language along with it. The administration has endorsed this language as a freestanding bill. 
Helping kids read should not be a partisan issue. Both Chambers have now passed Reading Excellence unanimously, and I urge the President to sign H.R. 2614 into law. I praise Chairman Goodling for his perseverance and dedication to helping over 3 million children at risk of falling behind. Senator Coats has also been a leader in getting this legislation to its final passage and we all thank him for his dedication to education. Today we take a first step, and as the poet Robert Frost says, `we have miles to go before we sleep.'

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report to the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill. This legislation includes much needed economic assistance for Georgia farmers. The disaster and market loss assistance proposal, which totals over $4 billion, includes $1.5 billion for one time payment to person with a crop loss in 1998, $675 million for multiple year crop loss and crops impacted by disease, $175 million for livestock feed assistance, $1.65 billion for a one time payment to offset financial hardship caused by the loss of markets, and $10 million for tree farmers through the Forestry Incentive Program. 
I would like to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Cochran, Senator Lugar, Senator Roberts, and others involved in the crafting of this important legislation. For months I have been stressing the need for Congress to address the current financial crisis facing farmers in Georgia and across the nation. I am pleased that our collective efforts bring us here to discuss this legislation. This disaster package is one step in many that is needed to get these farmers back on their feet. 
Under this proposal the Secretary of Agriculture is given broad authority to define and implement these provisions. I am hopeful that when deciding how to distribute these funds, the Secretary does not forget Georgia farmers. President Clinton and Secretary Glickman should not help farmers in one section of the country by neglecting farmers in the Southeast. Georgia farmers have suffered disasters 2 out of the last 5 years and should be eligible for assistance under the multi-year losses program. In addition, the Secretary should include all crops, insured and uninsured, when considering who should be eligible for assistance under this disaster and market assistance proposal. Georgia farmers who produce peaches, onions, blueberries, watermelons, pecans, and other speciality crops, have just as much right to be eligible for this disaster assistance as farmers who produce major program crops such as corn, wheat, and cotton. Those who bought crop insurance should not be unnecessarily penalized and left out of receiving any assistance under this legislation. The current crop insurance program does not work and needs to be completely overhauled by Congress. We need a crop insurance program which is affordable and factors in the cost of production. 
Secretary Glickman needs to also look at ways to provide assistance for peanut producers, either through a market loss assistance payment or under one of the other disaster assistance programs. The cost of production for peanuts continues to remain high while income for farmers continues to fall. Disease, weather, government regulations, taxes, increased costs for equipment and supplies, reduction in yields, and other problems have all contributed to this situation. 
I look forward to working with Secretary Glickman and the U.S. Department of Agriculture in making sure these funds are distributed in a fair and equitable manner.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Blue Ridge Rifles Precision Drill Team of North Georgia College and State University. The Blue Ridge Rifles finished first overall at the Tulane University Mardi Gras Drill Meet, their tenth such win since 1979. 
The Blue Ridge Rifles competed against outstanding competition, hailing from such esteemed institutions as West Point, the United States Air Force Academy, and the Georgia Military College. Furthermore, this competition was scored using Navy-Marine Corps standards of drill, so the Rifles, with their Army-based ROTC training, were competing under unfamiliar rules. The ability of the Rifles to adjust to these changes and compete, let alone win, is nothing short of exceptional. 
I also extend congratulations to Cadet Staff Sergeant Justin Shelton and Cadet Second Lieutenant Edward Boyd, who finished first and third in the individual exhibition respectively. 
The Blue Ridge Rifles are a proud component of North Georgia College and State University, an dedicated educational institution renowned for its excellent ROTC program. Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring this fine organization of young Americans as they celebrate their latest triumph.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have read and agree with the subcommittee's views on improving the efficiency of Nuclear Regulation Commission regulation. There is significant evidence that different, but equally protective, approaches to regulation could result in more efficient regulatory practices. 
As I am sure the Senator from New Mexico is aware, there are some areas within the Commission's purview that will be challenged to keep up with the growing workload even in the face of significant improvements in efficiency. An example is the Spent Fuel Project Office (SFPO) which is responsible for approving domestic use new dual purpose canister systems for the safe storage and transportation of spent nuclear fuel; ensuring the safety of existing technologies that have been deployed throughout the nuclear energy industry as needs for out-of-pool storage have emerged; reviewing and approving cask technologies necessary to support high priority non-proliferation activities of the United States, including the DOE Foreign Research Reactor Spent Fuel Receipt Program; reviewing and approving the transportation technologies for nuclear materials other than spent fuel; and reviewing and approving or providing support to a host of other spent fuel storage and transportation initiatives sponsored by either the federal government or private interests. 
Does the Chairman agree with me that this plays an important role and does he believe that the agency recognizes the importance of the office's work?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in reintroducing the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998. This legislation authorizes a $3 billion, three year initiative to enhance international drug eradication, interdiction and crop substitution efforts. 
The other body has already adopted a companion version of this bill in a 384-39 vote. That level of support reflects, I believe, a growing recognition by members of Congress that our current approach to the drug war is not working. While treatment and education and other demand reduction activities are vital to an overall drug strategy, you do not win a war by only treating the wounded. A balanced strategy is essential and we have in recent years neglected the interdiction and international components of our counterdrug efforts. 
The result has been a flood of drugs into our streets and schools and neighborhoods and disturbing increases in drug use. 
On August 21, 1998, the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, conducted by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Administration, was released. That report indicates that in 1997, 13.9 million Americans 12-and-over cited themselves as `current users' of illicit drugs--a 7 percent increase from 1996. Current illicit drug use among our nation's youth continues to increase at an alarming rate. From 1992-1997, youth aged 12-to-17 using illegal drugs has more than doubled (120 percent)--with a 27 percent increase from 1996-1997 alone. 
On September 1, 1998, the Back to School 1998: CASA Teen Survey, conducted by the National Center on Addiction & Substance Abuse at Columbia University, was released. A majority (51 percent) of high school students say the drug problem is getting worse. For the fourth straight year, both middle and high school students say that drugs are their biggest concern. More than three-quarters of high school teens report that drugs are used, sold and kept at their schools--an increase from 72 percent in 1996 to 78 percent in 1998. 
This newly drafted version of the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act reflects testimony heard at the joint hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control held on September 15. General Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, as well as officials from the Departments of State and Defense, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Customs Service and the United States Coast Guard testified. The committees also heard from experts of the General Accounting Office and the Institute for Defense Analysis. 
General McCaffrey in particular asked for greater flexibility in the provisions of the bill and we have granted that request. Our legislation still authorizes new aircraft, cutters, and `go-fast' boats for the Coast Guard and Customs Service. But we give these agencies the flexibility to prioritize from a menu of option and determine for themselves which are the greatest needs. 
The bill supports increased eradication and interdiction efforts in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico, as well as assistance for alternative crop development support in the Andean region. But again, we have tailored its provisions to give the State Department needed flexibility in determining priorities and adjusting to changing conditions. 
The bill also provides for development of international law enforcement training and improvements in drug transit and source zone law enforcement operations and equipment. 
Mr. President, the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998 is a bipartisan effort to restore a balanced drug strategy. I urge all Senators to support it.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act. This bill makes it a federal offense to knowingly transport a minor girl across state lines to circumvent her home state's parental consent or notification laws and obtain an abortion. This bill sends an important message that we will support those states that have tried to protect minors from making a decision of this magnitude without the involvement of the parents. We should do everything we can to ensure that parents are able to exercise the responsibilities of guiding and protecting their children, and I applaud Senator Abraham for his leadership on this issue. 
A few of my constituents raised some concerns about S. 1645 that I would like to address. First, the bill imposes no burden on the right to an abortion, and it adds no new provisions or restrictions on state laws. S. 1645 is designed merely to preserve the integrity of parental involvement laws in states that have chosen to enact them. Second, the legislation does not violate the constitutional right to travel. Like the recently enacted Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act, the Child Custody Protection Act only punishes travel that is undertaken with the intent of dodging legitimate state laws. Third, in cases where teenagers are afraid to tell their parents, there are judicial bypass procedures to address these situations. A study performed by the American Journal of Public Health of these bypass procedures found that only 1 out of 477 girls was denied judicial authorization. Fourth, S. 1645 recognizes the role of states in ensuring that legal abortions are safe--to allow valid state laws to be avoided is to undermine the safety of the procedure and endanger the health of those minors. Fifth, parental involvement laws enjoy the support of 74 percent of Americans according to a 1996 Gallup poll. While S. 1645 does not alter any state's laws regarding abortion, it does ensure that states that do have these popular laws have a more realistic chance of enforcing them.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the suggestion by the Senator from Arkansas. I have to depart in a few minutes, so he may choose to continue his remarks at that point. 
Let me say that I respectfully disagree with the comments we just heard from the Senator from Arkansas, as does the Supreme Court of the United States. I am comfortable that if every member of the Founding Fathers were here today, they would rise up in a loud chorus. The first amendment to the Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, makes it absolutely and abundantly and succinctly clear that there shall be freedom of speech. It doesn't define that somebody has this big a bucket and somebody has something else. It doesn't say a newspaper has the right to say anything it chooses, but some other kind of company will be constrained and managed by the Government. 
Of all the things that I believe the forefathers were most concerned about, it was the management of expression, the management of speech. They were very careful. They were going to protect the American citizens' right to assemble. Until the late 1700s, in Great Britain two people could not get together in a club or in an association. Why? Because the government was afraid of people coming together. They might think up ideas; they might want to talk about them. So they said there will be freedom of speech, there will be freedom of the press, there will be a right to assemble, and there will be a right to petition the government--they didn't say it, but without fear. These four things are in the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. They are probably, to this day, the core of the American Constitution. 
This has been tested over and over, and the Supreme Court has said that expression costs money. If you are going to have a town hall meeting, you have to rent the town hall. If you want to covey a message to a large audience, you can't go door to door; you are going to have to do it in a television ad or a newspaper ad. By the way, what is the difference between a corporation that publishes a newspaper or runs a television station and a corporation that makes tractors? Does one have a higher standing? Not under the Constitution. The outfit that makes tractors can spend money and express themselves just like a newspaper. Heaven help us if we ever come to the point where the only institution in our country that has freedom of speech is the media. If everything a political person does or a Government official does is only interpreted by the media, heaven help us. I used to say, if you are for the Government managing what people say, you better know the manager. You better know the manager. 
This whole issue is dominated by the subject of freedom of speech. I heard the distinguished Senator from Kentucky say many times that if this ever became law, it won't last. The Supreme Court will strike it down, which is probably the case, but it ought not to become law. It ought not to become law. Anybody reading the rulings of the Supreme Court understands very clearly that expression and financing expression are one and the same and cannot be separated. 
The last institution in the world that the forefathers would have ever wanted to manage speech is the Government. In fact, if you look at the Constitution from top to bottom, it is designed to protect us from Government--our own Government. They fought a revolution over this. They knew well what was happening in Europe. They looked over and saw what was happening in Ireland and said that is not going to happen in America. Of all the language in the Constitution, the most carefully crafted language for which there can be no question about its interpretation is the first amendment of the Bill of Rights. Freedom of speech shall not be abridged. 
This legislation does that. It abridges and begins to manage who can say what, when they can say it, and how much of it they can say. And any Government official ought to be very wary of a situation where one group of Americans can say anything they choose, at any time, with any intensity, and another group of Americans can only say what somebody else decided they should say, when they should say it, and how much. 
Mr. President, I could never support anything like that, as frustrated as we all get. Every American, at some point, has been affronted by freedom of speech. It has been frustrating to them to hear what somebody says or how they express themselves. I have been and everybody else has been. But better to suffer the frustration than to give that liberty to somebody to manage speech. America would never be the same. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which would modify the boundaries of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area to protect and preserve the endangered Chattahoochee River and provide additional recreation opportunities for the citizens of Georgia and our nation. This legislation authorizes the creation of a greenway buffer between the river and private development to prevent further pollution from continued development, provide flood and erosion control, and maintain water quality for safe drinking water and for the fish and wildlife dependent on the river system. In addition, this legislation promotes private-public partnerships by authorizing $25 million in federal funds for land acquisition for the recreation area. This $25 million will be matched by private funds but only if Congress acts quickly. The State of Georgia, private foundations, corporate entities, private individuals, and others have already given or pledged tens of millions of dollars to protect and preserve the Chattahoochee River for future generations of Georgians to enjoy. 
The legislation I introduce today is a Senate companion to legislation introduced by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. I applaud the leadership Speaker Gingrich has shown on this important issue. It is crucial for Congress to act quickly on this legislation in order to protect the Chattahoochee River, a vital natural resource. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this proposal and urge its speedy consideration.

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. Mr. President, Peace Corps volunteers are some of our best ambassadors to the world. They represent the finest characteristics of the American people: a strong work ethic, generosity of spirit, a commitment to service, and an approach to problems that is both optimistic and pragmatic. The people-to-people nature of the Peace Corps, and its separation from the formal conduct of the foreign policy of the United States, has allowed Volunteers to establish a record of service that is respected and recognized globally. 
Furthermore, the Peace Corps is helping to prepare America's workforce with overseas experience by training Volunteers to use skills that are increasingly important to America's participation in the international economy. Volunteers worldwide learn more than 180 languages and dialects, and they receive extensive cross-cultural training that enables them to function effectively at a professional level in different cultural settings. Returned Volunteers often use these skills and experiences to enhance careers in virtually every sector of our society--Congress, the Executive branch, the Foreign Service, education, business, finance, industry, trade, health care, and social services. 
The Peace Corps has emerged as a model of citizen service and of practical assistance to people in 132 developing countries, as my colleague mentioned. I can certify that during my tenure as Director and since then, virtually every ambassador or other official I have met from countries with volunteers is an enthusiastic supporter of the Peace Corps. They view the Peace Corps as the most successful program of its kind. I think it is the right time to look to further expansion of the Peace Corps and I believe reaching a level of 10,000 volunteers is an appropriate goal. I appreciate the funding constraints the Senator from Vermont spoke of. I hope that more resources do become available and at that time would look forward to working with my colleagues from Connecticut, Vermont, and the Chairman to prepare the Peace Corps for extending its mission into the 21st Century.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, in introducing this very important piece of legislation authorizing a new National Cemetery in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. For many years Georgia has had a pressing need for a new national cemetery for veterans. Now, with the leadership of my friend from Georgia who, I might add, has been working to make this a reality for about twenty years, and with the introduction of this legislation, I believe we can finally build this much needed cemetery. 
Mr. President, Georgia has one of the fastest growing veterans populations in the country. Currently, about 700,000 veterans call Georgia home with well over half, about 440,000, living in the Metro-Atlanta region; the area where this new cemetery would be built. However, the only national cemetery in the area has been full since 1970. Furthermore, the only other veterans cemetery in the state is operated by the National Parks Service, not the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and is in Andersonville, a town in southwest Georgia far from the concentration of Georgia veterans. 
Mr. President, I believe my colleague has clearly demonstrated to us all further justification for a new national cemetery in Georgia. VA studies have concurred the need for this cemetery and, in fact, Atlanta was chosen as a site for a new cemetery in 1983. Again, Senator Cleland makes all this clear and I thank him for his dedication to this project. 
Burial in a national cemetery is a deserving honor for our nation's veterans, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to bestow upon them, especially in Georgia. This bipartisan legislation seeks to remedy this situation. Mr. President, by focusing on areas across the country with pressing needs for more burial slots, Congress can increase access to the honor of burial in a national cemetery. Georgia is such an area. By passing this measure, Congress would help veterans, and their families, find a burial place befitting their patriotic service to this great land.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have just returned from a disaster area in our State. It is the most emotional difficulty, I believe, with which I have ever dealt. And I have dealt with a 1000-year flood and a 500-year flood. Back-to-back crises like this are enormous. 
I heard the exchange between the majority and minority leaders. I understand the tensions of the day. I appreciate the minority leader, in deference to the issue involved, removing his right to object. I appreciate that. 
That removal of an objection will lead to the movement and option of farmers, in many States, to relieve their cash flow problem. They have an equity problem. The proposal that the minority leader has mentioned, about the $500 million, and others, is something for the broader issue. There are many issues we are going to have to bring to the table to deal with this crisis. That is one idea. It is probably not near enough. It wouldn't take care of Georgia and South Carolina, much less Alabama and Texas and the Midwestern States. 
We do have a major issue in front of us dealing with food and fiber and the Nation's security. I hope we could proceed this evening with that which does not require new funds and it is simply a logistical and administrative decision that will move money more rapidly. 
I say to the leader, I appreciate the chance to speak on this. Again, I thank the minority leader for removing his objection.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of an amendment that I have cosponsored and introduced today with my colleague from New Mexico and Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, regarding funding for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. 
To date only fifty one percent of FLETC's master construction plan is completed, and this amendment would move FLETC closer toward its goal of being the centralized training center for our federal agencies. 
Whether traveling in my home state of Georgia, or chairing a Subcommittee hearing on drug interdiction, the need to address the crisis we face with drugs and crime is consistently brought to my attention. Through continued funding and support of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center we will be able to take the necessary steps to achieve this goal for all Americans. 
Mr. President, I once again urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my appreciation to the managers for accepting an amendment to S. 2312, the FY 1999 Treasury-Postal Service Appropriations bill, regarding the practice of randomly selecting innocent taxpayers for audits, otherwise known as random audits. This is an issue that has been a focus of mine for a long time. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss this matter with my good friend, the senior Senator from Colorado and the manager of the bill, who shares my concern about the impact the Internal Revenue Service has upon taxpayers and the potential for abuse of taxpayers' rights.

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my good friend. Over the past several years, all of us have seen news accounts of regular, average citizens who have become the targets of grueling IRS audits. These individuals were neither wealthy nor powerful; in fact, they were most often ordinary, law-abiding taxpayers who earned a modest wage, ran a small business, or operated a family farm. Some struggled just to make ends meet, and many were understandably confused about what wrong they had committed to justify the scrutiny of the IRS. 
The truth is they committed no wrong. They were simply unfortunate victims of a scandalous IRS practice called `random audits,' where the IRS just picks people out of a hat in the hope it can uncover some wrongdoing. 
A recent report produced by the General Accounting Office at my request confirms that the IRS has been targeting thousands of poor taxpayers and small businesses for random audits. In fact, almost 95 percent of all random audits performed between 1994 and 1996 were conducted on individual taxpayers who earned less than $25,000 each year. 
Last fall, hearings held by the Senate Finance Committee brought the IRS's abuse of taxpayers to the attention of the entire Nation. One witness, Jennifer Long, who is a current field agent with the IRS, remarked, `As of late, we seem to be auditing only the poor people. The current IRS Management does not believe anyone in this country can possibly live on less than $20,000 per year, insisting anyone below that level must be cheating by understating their true income.' 
The IRS' belief that low-income families are more likely to cheat than others serves as a disturbing sign of how far it has strayed from the principles of American justice. The GAO report also indicates that the IRS has been specifically targeting the State of Georgia for random audits. Nearly twice as many random audits took place in Georgia between 1994 and 1996 than in all the New England states combined and Georgians are three-times more likely to be randomly audited than their California counterparts. Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to prohibit the use of random audits by the IRS and will continue to protect innocent taxpayers.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the exemplary efforts of Dr. Bob Leftwich, a school counselor in Ellijay, Georgia. Over the past years, Dr. Leftwich has worked with students in his area by talking to them about life and their futures. In his discussions, he has urged students to be the very best they can be and to make firm commitments to excellence. 
Dr. Leftwich is a prime example of a hero in my book. He is a committed advocate for young people and the freedoms they can achieve through hard work and perseverance. 
It is people like Bob, with the motivation he brings to our students, who will be remembered when these students are the leaders of our great nation. They will no doubt look back and remember the impact that this individual had on their lives. And hopefully they will follow his lead by getting involved with young people themselves. 
Once again, Mr. President, I would like to thank Dr. Leftwich for his dedication to excellence. His work should serve as an encouragement to others to become more involved with the education of our nation's youth.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a concurrent resolution I have submitted, the subject of which is important not only to my constituents, but to anyone who stands by the Constitution of the United States. Ironically, while in England last May President Clinton, with little fanfare or media attention, issued Executive Order (EO) 13083. EO 13083 in both its letter and intent seeks to give executive departments and agencies greater preemptive authority over State and local law in the administration of Executive Branch policies. Ultimately this action is an attempt by the President to promote an agenda by circumventing Congress while subverting the Constitution and the principles of a limited federal government that the Framers were so careful to express in writing this document. 
Mr. President, as members of Congress we have each taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. The President has done the same. And as we all know, the Constitution is our nation's most important document. It establishes the way our government works; it establishes the freedoms American citizens enjoy; and it provides for protections of those freedoms. 
The Framers understood that individual freedom and centralized power are incompatible. Thus they set out not only to decentralize our federal government, but also to balance the power held at the national level with the power held by individual states. The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution explicitly expresses this intent. It states `The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' I believe that sentence is perfectly clear, yet our Federal Government continues to grow in size and scope. All three branches of the government are to blame. 
Is this a reason, however, to allow continued federal infringement into state matters? Must we not at some point ask ourselves where we draw the line? I believe we must if we hope to preserve the meaning of the Constitution. 
EO 13083 sacrifice states rights and Constitutional principles to empower further the Federal Government. It does so by broadly defining `matters of national or multi-state scope that justify Federal action.' These loosely defined `matters' include any matter of concern that is not confined by a single state's boundaries; any matter involving a `need for national standards;' any matter in which `decentralization increases the costs of government;' any matter in which `States would be reluctant to impose necessary regulations because of fears that regulated business activity will relocate to other states;' and any matter related to `Federally owned or managed property or natural resources, trust obligation or international organizations.' Such ambiguous terms give this Administration tremendous leeway to implement policies through executive order that might meet resistance in Congress--policies that deserve full consideration by Congress before becoming law. Indeed, a number of recent newspaper articles demonstrate the President's desires to move an agenda without Congressional approval. The President's EO would allow circumvention of Congress while trampling the Tenth Amendment. Mr. President, we should be wary of this. 
This is why I submit today a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the intent of the Framers must guide federal executive departments and agencies when carrying out policies with federalism implications. Through this concurrent resolution Congress would reaffirm the principles of federalism the Framers used in writing the Constitution and express its sense regarding the criteria federal agencies should use in formulating and implementing policies that have federalism implications. Mr. President, I find it difficult when one looks at this resolution in a constitutional context, which is the context in which we must evaluate this issue, to disagree with its findings and the criteria it establishes. I believe this Congress must make a statement on where it stands with the Executive Branch's attempts to encroach, through executive order, on states rights. This resolution is an opportunity for Congress to do so. 
Mr. President, I ask through this resolution that each of us reaffirm the pledges we made when we first entered office. I ask that we recognize the importance of local and state governments, their abilities to solve their problems on their own terms and the powers given the states by the Constitution. I ask that we honor the Framers' intent to limit the power of the Federal government.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the past several years have been devastating for a large number of Georgia farmers. Due to the large amounts of weather damage and associated agriculture production losses, numerous farmers and agribusinesses are faced with dire financial situations. 
Farmers from across the state of Georgia are facing their worst crop disaster in many years. Currently, damages are estimated at about $450 million and rising. The drought in Georgia has already lasted 3 months and has caused farmers water supplies to dry up, leaving many without a source of irrigation water. I understand fully that it is not only in my home state where farmers are suffering. It is occuring in many parts of the country. 
To help alleviate farmers' financial difficulties, today I am proud to introduce legislation with my esteemed colleagues Majority Leader Lott, Senator Cochran, Senator Faircloth, Senator Shelby, Senator Gramm, Senator Lugar and Senator Hutchison, which will help provide American farmers with much needed financial relief. The bill--The Emergency Farm Financial Relief Act--would allow farmers the option of receiving all of the Agriculture Market Transition Act (AMTA) contract payments for FY 1999 immediately after the beginning of the fiscal year. Annual payments can now be made two times a year, in December or January and again in September. The legislation we introduce today is a Senate companion to House legislation introduced by Representative Bob Smith, Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. 
The bill would make $5.5 billion available much earlier in order to help farmers cope with the cash shortages they are now experiencing due to low prices and poor production. This important initiative leaves the decision to accept early payments or not solely with the farmer. Since all of the 1999 AMTA payments occur within the same fiscal year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has determined that this proposal would not cost any additional taxpayer funds. 
While this legislation is not the only answer to helping farmers during their time of economic hardship, it is a much needed overture which provides farmers with immediate financial relief. Certainly we have other measures to consider, but this is a good first step. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this proposal and urge its speedy consideration.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the motion to proceed to consideration of S. 2271, the Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998. This bill, introduced by the senior Senator from Utah, incorporates provisions of the bipartisan bill I introduced last year along with the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, on this same subject. 
Our legislation, the Property Owners Access to Justice Act, was introduced to simplify access to the federal courts for private property owners. S. 2271 would accomplish the same objective. The Constitution requires that when the government takes private property for a public purpose, the property owner must receive just compensation. This `takings clause' guarantee is one of the strongest defenses we have against arbitrary government. 
Yet in many cases property owners must navigate a time-consuming and expensive procedural maze to protect their rights. Federal courts do not consider a takings case `ripe' for their consideration until all state law issues have been resolved and all administrative remedies exhausted. For property owners this can mean years of court battles and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to win the right to have a federal court hear the merits of their case. One study found less than 6% of takings claims filed between 1983 and 1988 were ever deemed ripe for federal court adjudication. 
Small landowners, first-time home buyers, and family farmers simply cannot afford this process. They deserve to have their claims heard and their rights in their own property settled.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a brief moment on the amendment offered by my colleague from Florida to the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. This amendment is a common sense correction of a barrier veterans face when applying for financial aid from colleges and universities. 
Currently, educational benefits veterans receive under the Montgomery GI bill count as a financial resource when they apply for financial aid. The ultimate result is a reduction in the total financial aid award a veteran receives to pay for college. I find it ironic, Mr. President, that the benefits intended to help veterans pay for higher education end up counting against them. Furthermore, the National Community Service Act of 1990 does not treat a national service educational award or post-service benefit as financial assistance. To present a contrasting case, Americorps education benefits are not counted as a resource in financial aid calculations. 
Veterans who pay for the Montgomery GI bill through paycheck deductions and dedicated service to their country should not be penalized when applying for financial aid. Mr. President, we all understand the value of higher education, and we should work to eliminate the barriers that prevent people from moving on to college. This was the intent of the Montgomery GI bill, Mr. President--assist veterans in their pursuit of higher education. We should honor the intent of this bill. 
Mr. President, I am proud to be a part of this effort to help our nation's veterans and pleased to serve as an original co-sponsor to the bill Senator Graham introudced last evening. I urge my colleagues to adopt this important measure. 
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998. The Tenth Amendment was a promise to the States and to the American people that the Federal Government would be limited, and that the people of the States could, for the most part, govern themselves as they saw fit. Unfortunately, in the last half century, that promise has been broken. The American people have asked us to start honoring that promise again: To return power to State and local governments which are close to and more sensitive to the needs of the people. 
We took an important first step in the 104th Congress by enacting the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. It began the shift of power out of Washington and back to the States and to the American people. Today we continue that process. The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998 will return power to the States and to the people by placing safeguards in the legislative process, by restricting the power of Federal agencies and by instructing the Federal courts to enforce the Tenth Amendment. 
The Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998 enforces the Tenth amendment in five ways. First, it includes a specific congressional finding that the Federal Government has no powers not delegated by the Constitution, and the States may exercise all powers not withheld by the Constitution. In other words, the Tenth Amendment means what it says. 
Second, this proposal states that Federal laws may not interfere with State or local powers unless Congress declares its intent to preempt and specifically cites its constitutional authority to act. 
Third, it enforces this declaration by establishing a point of order that allows any Congressman or Senator to challenge a bill lacking such a declaration or insufficiently citing constitutional authority. Such a point of order would require a three-fifths majority to be defeated. 
Fourth, it requires that Federal agency rules and regulations not interfere with State or local powers without constitutional authority cited by Congress. Agencies must allow States notice and an opportunity to be heard in the rulemaking process. 
Fifth, the proposal directs the courts to strictly construe Federal laws and regulations interfering with State powers. It requires a presumption in favor of State authority and against Federal preemption. 
Too often in Washington, there is the temptation to weakening our Federal system of government. It has been stated that just as the separation and independence of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serves to prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny and abuse from either front. We have an obligation to take steps to prevent such things from happening and to preserve the freedom and liberties we enjoy. I believe the Tenth Amendment Enforcement Act of 1998 is an important step and urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a resolution I introduced honoring the heroes of the Berlin Airlift. Today marks the fiftieth anniversary of this great undertaking. This massive Allied effort to provide relief to a post war Berlin held hostage by the Soviet Union displayed to the world, the resolve of the western world to fight oppression and began a long fight against Soviet Communism that culminated with the collapse of the Berlin Wall. 
The former Soviet Union, Britain, France and the United States occupied separate sectors of Germany after World War II. Berlin, located in the Soviet zone of Germany, was occupied in a similar fashion. In response to a failing economy the Western powers undertook an effort to reform the German currency. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, kept the old German currency from entering its zones by banning, on June 24, 1948, all travel into and out of the Western half of the city. The Soviets also cut the supply of electricity to this zone. Berlin's economy was in ruins and its citizens were under virtual seige. 
The response to this blockade was one of the most heroic and monumental undertakings in history. For fifteen months Allied transport planes shipped food, coal and supplies into Berlin. During the height of this effort airplanes were taking off every three minutes, twenty four hours a day, while delivering daily 14,000 tons of supplies. All told, 2,326,205 tons of supplies were delivered by 277,728 flights in the face of Soviet efforts to thwart the Allies. 
Mr. President, these numbers do not speak to the personal stories of those who organized and participated in the Berlin airlift, the sacrifices they made and the selflessness they displayed. They do not speak to the lives lost during the operation, 31 of which were American. They do not speak to the gratitude those in Berlin felt toward the Allies who were so willing after such a brutal war, to provide them with life-sustaining relief. Mr. President, let us all keep these ideas in mind as we remember the Berlin Airlift, what it meant to the world in a post World War II environment, and what it has come to mean to us today. 
Finally, Mr. President I would like to note that next week, on July 2, 1998, a delegation with representatives from the Berlin Sculpture Fund will visit Berlin to present a gift of art to the citizens of the Federal Republic of Germany in commemoration of the 50th Anniversary of the Berlin Airlift. The Berlin Sculpture Fund and its Chairman, General John Mitchell, should be commended for their work to commemorate this event and the impact it made on our world's history.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers that would fence in funding for advanced procurement for the six Lot II F-22 aircraft until 601 hours of flight testing of F-22 flight test vehicles has been completed and reported. By requiring the completion of an absolute number of test flight hours before releasing funds, this amendment places on the F-22 program constraint which would slow down the program, increase costs and jeopardize full procurement of the Air Force's requirement for this weapon. 
First, I would like to note that the Armed Services Committee has already placed conditions on funding for the six Lot II F-22's. The Committee, in this very bill, included language mandating that procurement funds for these aircraft will not be released until the F-22 has completed 433 hours of flight testing, or the Secretary of Defense determines that a number of hours of flight testing less than 433 provides a sufficient basis for deciding to proceed to production. From what we know of this plane it has performed well. The F-22 meets or exceeds all expectations, and I expect this course to continue. 
It is estimated that this amendment would delay the F-22 program up to one year. By breaking production lines and undermining firm fixed price contracts, production would have to wait while testing is completed, even if the F-22 has fully demonstrated its capabilities and the Defense Department has full confidence that the plane is ready for production. This delay would, in turn, increase costs of the program by up to $4 billion. This substantial cost increase would break the Congressionally mandated cost caps, at full expense to the tax payer, and risk full procurement of the Air Force's requirement. 
Mr. President, the approach to the issue of flight test hours is most appropriately addressed by the Armed Services Committee in the Defense Authorization bill. This approach makes flight test requirements an essential component of full funding while providing the flexibility to proceed with the program should the F-22 prove, as it has already, that it is a plane ahead of its time. Our country cannot afford to let this program get off track. The F-22 is a vital component of our future national security. We must fund it, we must build it and we must fly it.

One of the most important aspects of military readiness is the quality of life that the soldiers who defend our Nation encounter on a daily basis. This amendment focusses only on quality of life projects and funds projects of only the highest priority--those on the Armed Services' Future Years Defense Plan. 
Mr. President, two projects found in this amendment are located in Georgia, one at Robins Air Force Base and one at Moody Air Force Base. I know from my visits to these military installations that these projects will contribute substantially to the quality of life for the soldiers stationed at the respective bases.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a position taken by the House last month in their version of the Defense Authorization bill. During House debate, Congressman Graham of South Carolina and Congressman Markey of Massachusetts introduced an amendment to ban the use of commercial nuclear reactors to produce tritium. Tritium, as you know Mr. President, is a material essential to the efficacy of our nuclear arsenal which, because it decays, must be replenished over time. Tritium has not been produced in this country since 1988 and a new source is needed to maintain our nuclear weapons stockpile at the levels called for in the START II treaty. The question now is where production of the needed tritium will take place. 
For fifty years the United States has drawn a strong line between commercial and military production of nuclear materials. While tritium is produced in commercial reactors as a by-product of the fission process, this material is not used for nuclear weapon application. Instead, tritium for our nuclear arsenal was long produced at the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The DOE is now considering the use of a commercial reactor to produce weapons grade tritium. We must not arbitrarily allow this shift in our nation's nuclear policy. 
The recent nuclear tests in India and Pakistan sent a strong signal across the world that the efforts, particularly those of the United States, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons have not fully succeeded. In this light we must upgrade our efforts to halt nuclear proliferation. Should Congress allow the commercial production of weapons grade tritium we would take a step backwards in our efforts to curtail proliferation. We would tell the rest of the world that commercial reactors are a viable means to enhance a nuclear arsenal. This is no time to send this kind of message. 
The DOE's other option is to build a nuclear accelerator at the Savannah River Site, where production of tritium for our nuclear arsenal has traditionally taken place. Mr. President, this is the correct policy option for our country and for our efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. I hope that when the Senate and the House begin their conference negotiations on the FY99 Defense Authorization bill the Senate will agree to the language included in the House bill by Congressmen Graham and Markey preventing commercial production of tritium.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the recent actions of two businessman and philanthropists, Mr. Ted Forstmann and Mr. John Walton. 
On Tuesday, June 9, 1998, the two men launched the Children's Scholarship fund with an initial contribution of one hundred million dollars. This fund is going to provide scholarships to help families of modest means send their children to private or parochial schools where they will face strong academic challenges. 
As this body, indeed this nation, continues to debate the future of education, one fact is clear--a good education is the key to a promising future. The best way to help young people is to ensure that they have a solid education that challenges their minds and helps them reach their full potential. Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton are helping many children along the path by giving their hard-working parents a helping hand. 
Through grass roots initiatives such as the Children's Scholarship Fund, we will we ensure that our country remains the world's leader. 
I would like to wish the Children's Scholarship Fund the best of luck over the next several months as they look for people across America willing to serve as partners in this effort. The fund has already contacted more than 300 mayors and community leaders to seek their partnership with the fund and provide scholarships in their communities. Also, I would like to offer my assistance in contacting cities and other municipalities in my home state of Georgia. 
Once again, Mr. Forstman and Mr. Walton should be commended for their commitment to the education of our nation's youth, and I thank them for their generosity.

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my colleague from Missouri for the contribution he has made in this debate and for the work he has expended on behalf of this legislation, and for his remarks. 
Mr. President, many, many years ago, in my home city of Atlanta, and in campaigns, I met a woman who worked and still works in our inner city with many of the inner-city problems. She is now the chairperson of the City Wide Advisory Council on Public Housing. Her name is Louise Watley. 
She recently wrote a letter to me and my colleague, Senator Cleland from Georgia, and she said: 
As a resident of the Carver Homes Public Housing Community since 1955, I have witnessed generations of young African Americans grow up in one our Nation's poorest neighborhoods. In the 1980s, I fought the epidemic of crack cocaine among our youth by working to kick drug dealers out of our community. In the 1990s, I find myself fighting the epidemic of hopelessness that has resulted from the increasing failure of our public schools to educate poor, urban children, As the Chairperson of the City Wide Advisory Council on Public Housing (`CWAC') and on behalf of the thousands of Atlanta public housing residents the Council represents, I ask you to provide us with hope for improving the K-12 education of our children. 
By way of this letter, I urge both of you to continue this important trend of granting parents greater choice in the education of their children. Please avoid the temptation of sacrificing the poorest children in America in order to protect an education bureaucracy that seems to care more about money and job security than it does about helping children to read, to write and to recognize right from wrong. 
Please support the passage of the A+ Accounts for Public and Private Schools Act as well as stronger federal charter school legislation and demonstration public and private school choice projects. 
I have not seen Louise in many, many years. But I am encouraged that she is still at work on behalf of our community. 
I think she has in this letter crystallized the very severe problem we are having all across the country, for we are graduating students from all too many schools who do not have the basic skills to enjoy the full benefits of citizenship. 
Earlier in the debate, the Senator from Virginia, who, while kind to this legislation, indicated he would vote against it on its scoring priorities, said this bill, or the education savings account, spends $1.5 billion in tax relief for families to open these savings accounts and that if we are going to spend $1.5 billion, we ought to do it on higher priorities. 
The math doesn't work. The education savings account creates $1.5 billion of tax relief on the interest built up on savings that families put into savings accounts if they use it for education. 
It does not spend $1.5 billion; it leaves $1.5 billion in those checking accounts of those families. And what do they do? They save $12 billion. So what we have done is, we have taken $1.5 billion, we have left it home all across the country, and we have built a resource eight times that size. So instead of looking at it as if it is $1.5 billion we did not ratchet out of somebody's checking account, you ought to look at it as if we have encouraged Americans to save $12 billion that would come to the aid of education. Where else can you invest $1.5 billion and store up $12 billion that would come to the support of children all across the land. 
It is a plus. We are causing billions of new dollars to come to the aid of educators and education. It is just amazing; I heard several Senators on the other side view this as an expenditure because we left some money in the checking accounts of American families. It has always been amazing to me how little incentive it takes to make Americans do huge things. Boy, wouldn't we love it if every billion we invested here could generate $12 billion of value. It would be a remarkable achievement. So this is not setting $1.5 billion aside for building schools or doing something else. This is leaving $1.5 billion in checking accounts, and it causes them to pull together $12 billion. And that is the minimal estimate. I think it will be much more. 
I think it is good in the closing minutes here to remind the Senate and anybody listening that this legislation has an enormous reach. Sometimes we forget to analyze or take a look at the total value. I just said this legislation will cause Americans to save at a minimum $12 billion. If nothing else, helping that would be great, considering the fact we have one of the lowest savings rates in the industrialized world. But this bill will make beneficiaries of half the school population wherever they go to school--public, private, or home--in the United States. Fourteen million families will open a savings account. We don't know how many million sponsors--grandparents, companies, unions and churches--will come to the aid of those accounts, because it allows sponsors, but 14 million families parenting over 20 million children--that is half the school population--will be beneficiaries if this bill passes and is signed by the President. One million students entering higher education will have a better chance of financing it because it gives tax relief to the 21 States that have prepaid tuition plans, and 17 new States are considering it. 
Fourteen million families, 20 million children, 1 million students in higher education, 1 million employees seeking to improve their continuing education will be helped by the legislation. In other words, Mr. President, the reach of the bill that is before us, the bipartisan bill, is enormous and will have the effect of causing millions of families and millions of students across this land to enter into a new consciousness about improving their education, and it will be the smartest money that was ever accumulated because it will be guided like a missile system by the parents and relatives and friends of that child to the most urgent needs that child faces. If they have special education problems or health problems, if they have a deficiency in math or reading, it will end up paying for it, or a computer or tutor. And I might point out that over 80 percent of the students in inner-city schools do not have a computer. This can begin to take care of it. 
Mr. President, this legislation reaches into every 
community at every level, and while it is not a cure-all it gives lots of people lots of new tools to go to work on turning this situation around in America. And if you want the next century to be an American century, you better be focused on grades kindergarten through high school. We need to get that job done. 
Mr. President, how much time is remaining?

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the results of the 1998 Stanford 9 tests--better known as the SAT's--are now available. Overall, the results are dismal. No matter what improvements may be noted here and there, the bottom-line numbers reveal a failing education system that shortchanges the students and parents who rely upon it. 
In each of the four categories of performance--below basic, basic, proficient, and advanced, the story is the same. As a group, the kids fall farther behind as they progress through the system. That's the case with regard to both math skills and reading. 
That disturbing news is all the more reason for those of us who are committed to structural reform of this country's schools to redouble our efforts, especially in providing education alternatives for low-income families. 
In the process, we should not overlook the need for sound management in our schools. Indeed, managerial reforms, implemented on the State and local level, will be crucial to the success of education reform. That is the point made by Donald Bedell, Chairman of the Bedell Group and a long-time consultant in management and organizational structure for major corporations.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I would like to commend the conferees. I would like to commend Chairman Archer of the conference committee. I believe they have brought to the Senate, as they did the House, a sweeping education reform proposal that will affect millions upon millions of American children trying successfully to obtain a quality education. They have obtained a bipartisan approach that has been embraced by some of the more distinguished Members of the other side who will speak to this. To paraphrase Senator Lieberman in the press conference at the announcement of the conference report, he said it was clear to him that the Republican leadership had reached out to his party and to the President, and he thought the time had come for their side to reach out as well. And, therefore, we now begin a discussion of the conference report on education reform in the United States. 
Mr. President, first I would like to talk, just briefly, about the number of people who will be affected if what is clearly going to pass the Senate with a very strong vote and has passed the House already and will be sent to the President to consider, is signed by the President. In the first case, some 14 million families will open education savings accounts who are the parents of 20 million children. Think about it. That is about half of the school population in kindergarten through high school that would be the beneficiary--half of the school population of the United States. These are precarious times. As we come to a new century, we have a new tool to use to help parents see to the needs of their children. 
What has always been amazing to me about this proposal--which the other side has pointed out almost ridiculously, but I will come to that--is that it is a very modest form of tax relief because it allows the interest buildup on these savings accounts to accrue without being taxed so long as the account is used for an educational purpose. The tax relief, therefore, for these education savings accounts over the next 5 years, is a little over $1 billion, $1 billion to $1.3 billion. 
What is amazing is how little incentive it takes to make Americans do huge things, because that limited tax relief will cause those 14 million families on behalf of their 20-plus million children to save over $5 billion. Over 10 years it will cause them to save over $12 billion. It is just amazing. 
I was just reading a report where the savings rate in the United States has plunged to 3.9 percent, one of the lowest levels in a half a century. So this becomes win/win, because not only does it cause Americans to save, and large sums of money, but it is for education, the Nation's No. 1 problem by everybody's account as we come to the new century. 
It does a lot of other things as well. The conference report will help over 1 million students deal with the costs of higher education because it helps qualified State tuition programs and protects them from tax burdens, and that makes them more valuable. Over 1 million students will benefit from this; 21 States already have these plans and 17 have them under consideration. It has a component in the conference report which came out of the Senate Finance Committee, which will help over 1 million employees expand their continuing education. It will help 1 million employees seek continuing education because it will allow employers to spend up to $5,250 on behalf of an employee's continuing education, and it is not seen as taxable income to the employee. So over a million employees will 
benefit from it. 
It has an arbitrage rebate exception for public school bonds, which will help the construction of public schools. 
The provision that was inserted in the Finance Committee from Senator Graham, which I believe is a very good provision which would be broader on school construction, did not become a part of the conference report, I am sorry to say. I hope I will be able to work with the Senator from Florida to expand that at another day. 
It includes a provision that was adopted by the Senate with 100 votes, the Reading Excellence Act, which authorizes a literacy program which focuses on training teachers to teach reading with scientifically proven methods like phonics. The House passed similar language unanimously, and the President of the United States endorsed this bill. So here we have a provision that received total bipartisan support and has been endorsed by the President of the United States. 
It retains the same-sex school provision of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, which makes it an allowable use of Federal education dollars to fund education reform projects that provide same-gender schools and classrooms as long as comparable educational opportunities are offered for students of both sexes. 
It keeps the Senate-passed measure, Teacher Testing Merit Pay, by the Senator from New York; Dollars to the Classroom, which requires 95 percent of Federal education dollars to find their way to the classroom, by the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson; the Student Improvement Grant Program, offered by the Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne; a multilingualism study, by Senator McCain; and SAFE Schools, by Senator Dorgan. 
Mr. President, in deference to the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has now arrived, I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey leaves, there has been no more eloquent spokesperson for these reforms than he. 
You alluded, Senator, to the gift from the grandparent, but you introduced the debate with the suggestion this could be a form of union negotiations, which I think it would. 
I just want to point out two points: The $12 billion we cite is not a calculation of the first dollar that would come from outside sources, which makes this savings account unique--that a union, a company, a neighborhood, a church, anything, could adopt a child with a savings account. None of that money is in the calculation of the $12 billion, and there is no way to estimate, but I believe it will match ultimately the parents' contribution of the $12 billion. 
The second point I make is that those who have more difficulty saving because of their income strata will have these outside sources, which is one of the reasons for the sponsor contributions that will help open those accounts for those families who have more difficulty. 
As the Senator said, we will not get to all of them, no, but a lot that otherwise would have no opportunity for one of these kinds of accounts to be opened. 
The last thing I mention, you talk about parent involvement. 
What better reminder to the parent about the condition of the child than when they get that booklet and look at it once a month and get a notice from the savings and loan, or from the bank, that says how much is in the account, how much is building up for Johnny or Susie, once a month or once a quarter? Fourteen million-plus families will be reminded that we have some work to do here. I think the benefits of that cannot be calculated, and that the bonding begins to occur every time one of those accounts is open. I thank the Senator. 
I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Florida.

Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator was describing the chronology of the account. He hit on a very important point that I want to reinforce. The Senator from New Jersey did it well. That is, last year, with the President's cooperation, Congress initiated and he signed an education savings account that was only $500, and only for higher education. This proposal, according to the description of the Senator from Colorado--which is correct, I might add--says that we will make the $500 go up to $2,000. You can save four times as much. You can use it for higher education or for any grade, kindergarten through high school. 
This has taken what we celebrated with bands and celebrations on the White House Lawn last year and made it broader. It is not just $500 for higher education now, it is $2,000. It is not just for higher education, it can be used for kindergarten all the way through high school, or higher education. We use the identical criteria that we used to determine which middle-class families could use it. It is the same. 
Am I properly describing the point that the Senator made?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just to expand on what the Senator from Colorado said, we talked earlier about the 14 million families that would save up to $12 billion. And those dollars can be used for any educational purpose. As the Senator from Colorado alluded, it can be a computer, it can be a special learning problem that requires special attention, or it can be an afterschool program. I call this money `smart money.' What I mean is that this money will ultimately go right to the target of the child's needs. A lot of money in public education can't do that, understandably, with buildings, turning on lights, and paying salaries. But this money will be guided almost like a missile system right to the problem the child has. And it is being guided by those who know best what that problem is--their parents. So the exponential value of this money is much greater than most education dollars can achieve. 
Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to sort of underscore why education has become the No. 1 issue in our country and take us back 15 years ago to Secretary Bell, who was President Reagan's first Education Secretary. He had this Department of Education publish a book that became known as `A Nation At Risk.' That is the name of the publication. It described a general condition and warned the Nation that we are developing a vast problem in our academic system. But it focused primarily on kindergarten through high school. 
It is interesting to look at where we have come since he notified America and the education community that we have a problem. 
In that report, `A Nation At Risk,' it said international comparisons of student achievement reveal that on 19 academic tests, American students were never first and never second; and, in comparison with other industrialized nations, we were last seven times. 
In 1998, 15 years later, a recently released study shows that American 12th graders ranked 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in mathematics and 16th out of 21 in science. In other words, we were never first 15 years ago, we were never second, and we were last seven times. After 15 years of effort, we are 19th out of 21; we are not even close to first or second. And we are 16th out of 21. In other words, we have gone backwards. 
Fifteen years ago, 23 million American adults were functionally illiterate, according to the report. And in 1992, 20 percent of the adult population had only rudimentary reading and writing skills. That is going in the wrong direction. Fifteen years ago, 13 percent of all 17-year-olds in the United States were considered functionally illiterate, and functional illiteracy among minority youth may run as high as 40 percent. The literacy level of young adults aged 15 to 21 dropped 11 points from 1984 to 1992, and 25 percent of all 12th graders scored below basics in reading on the 1994 National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
Fifteen years ago, `A Nation At Risk' reported that between 1975 and 1980 remedial mathematics courses in public 4-year colleges increased 72 percent and then constituted one-quarter--25 percent--of all mathematics courses taught in these institutions. They were saying, in 4-year colleges, 
one quarter of all mathematics courses dealt with remedial education. In 1995, 30 percent of first-time college freshmen enrolled in at least one remedial course and 80 percent of all public 4-year universities offered remedial courses. 
In other words, Mr. President, in every one of these categories, one after the other, the warning given to us in 1983, 15 years ago, has not caused us--I know it has caused us to spend millions and billions of our dollars, but the point is, as the Senator from New Jersey said a moment ago, the status quo is unacceptable, and the status quo produced results, after having received the warning 15 years ago, that are worse than they were 15 years ago. It is very alarming, the recent study that said only 4 out of 10 students in inner-city schools can now pass a basic math exam, and if you take all the schools and put them together, we get it up to only 6 out of 10. 
We cannot accept this. Innovation is being begged for. 
If we allow this to continue, for the first time in America--America has never had a caste system. There has always been massive mobility in economic achievement--people on the bottom rung moving up, people on the top moving down. It has been the story of America. But if we keep putting people on the street who cannot read and write, and if we spend another 15 years like we have the last 15, we will produce a permanent economic caste system in the country and we will forever change the nature of this great Republic. We will forever change it if we ever accept a condition by which thousands upon thousands, millions of students come out of high school and cannot effectively read or write. 
How much time remains on our side?

Mr. COVERDELL. I see we have been joined by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who will be arguing the other side, and for his benefit I will go on another several minutes here. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts will endeavor to infer that this undermines public education, and the Secretary of the administration has inferred as much. It is just absolutely incorrect. Mr. President, 70 percent of the 14 million families, 11 million families who open these accounts will have students in public schools, as the Senator from New Jersey noted. Because they are in public schools at the end of the day and this money is divided, the families who have children in public schools will represent about half the $12 billion that is saved over the next decade, and the families who have children in private schools will save the other half. 
That is understandable, because the families who have made a decision to send their child to a private school know they have to save more. But the bottom line is, 70 percent of the families will have kids in public schools, 30 percent in private. Fifty percent of the money will support children in public schools, and 50 percent will support children in private schools or home schools. 
The other side will try to infer that this is a voucher. Vouchers are the redistribution of public money. The money going into these savings accounts is aftertax dollars, and the only tax benefit available is that the interest earned would be forgiven of tax so long as the dollars were used for an educational purpose. This is not a voucher. 
Several people on the other side have suggested that this is insignificant, that it is not a great amount of money, and they are right. The tax incentive is minimal over the 10-year period, but what is stunning about it is how much it causes these American families to save on their own--new money. No board of education has had to raise the millage rate. There is no new State income tax. There is no new Federal income tax. This is the flow of the volunteer money to help students in public, private, and home schools. 
The other side likes to infer from time to time that this only benefits the wealthy. Seventy percent of the money would go to families earning $75,000 or less, and we get into all kinds of arguments over which families are what. But I would only make this point, that the determination of who can open these accounts and who benefits from them is middle class driven, and in this legislation we are discussing in the Chamber right now, the criteria are identical to the criteria that were designed by the other side last year, for what really was a minimal savings account of up to $500 to help families for higher education only. And we have said, well, let's expand that; let's let them at least save $2,000, and let's let them use it for any school year--kindergarten all the way through college; let's give them more opportunity and more flexibility. 
But the families involved are identical to the families who celebrated last year on the White House lawn when the President signed legislation that created a $500 savings account just for college. And here we are today, saying, let's make it $2,000 for college or any other grade. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to S. 2057, the Defense Authorization Bill. The Defense Authorization bill as currently written contains a section authorizing a pilot program promoting GED recipients to Tier I recruiting status for the Armed Forces. My amendment would simply add graduates of home schools to this pilot program. 
All service branches of the military have limited openings for recruits. As a result, military recruiters utilize a system in which they give preference to applicants who have at least graduated from high school. These are Tier I applicants. Currently, home schoolers have Tier II status, meaning only when a recruiter cannot find a Tier I applicant to fill an opening does a home schooler come up for consideration. This is true despite evidence indicating that the average home schooled student scores in at least the 80th percentile in all subjects on standardized tests while the typical public school student scores around the 50th percentile. This would indicate that home schoolers complete an educational program at least as rigorous as that of the average high school student. Why then should home schoolers not be placed in the same recruiting tier as their high school counterparts? 
While the Department of Defense has concerns that home schoolers have higher attrition rates than other Tier I candidates, there is not a significant enough body of evidence to support these claims. Certainly, retaining soldiers is a large concern for all services. However, due to their Tier II status, very few home schoolers have been recruited into the military over the past ten years. Accordingly, no valid statistical sample exists demonstrating home schoolers' attrition rates. It is the intent of my amendment to establish a valid statistical sample of attrition rates for home schoolers upon which the Armed Services can make a more educated assessment of its tier assignments. 
Mr. President, the Armed Forces in recent years have experienced recruiting problems. While they actively work to address these issues I believe Congress should also look at possible solutions. My amendment is an attempt to do just that. I offer today not only an opportunity for home schoolers, but an opportunity for the military to explore fully a new recruiting tool.

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my friend, Senator Inhofe, for bringing this issue to my attention. I understand the potential safety problems involved in the `order to land' provisions, and I agree that we cannot jeopardize the safety of aircraft flying near the border for innocent purposes. I understand that we can achieve the goal of fighting drug smuggling without jeopardizing safety or undermining the rights of pilots by requiring reasonable suspicion and adding innocent owner provisions. 
In fact, it was my intention to make the changes you have suggested. However, because of a parliamentary oversight, the corrections were not made prior to the vote on the amendment. 
I appreciate your leadership in resolving this issue. With your assistance, I will work with the conferees should S. 1415 reach conference to make the necessary changes to resolve these problems or to eliminate the provision entirely as I understand the status quo is acceptable.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately proceed to a second attempt to invoke cloture on the pending tobacco bill. Assuming cloture is not invoked, it will be the leader's intention to try to reach an agreement similar to the agreement reached yesterday with respect to the drug issue. If an agreement can be reached, Members should expect two votes on the marriage penalty issue at 1 or 2 p.m. That would be this afternoon. Following those votes, it is hoped that Members will come to the floor to offer and debate remaining amendments to the tobacco bill. Therefore, votes will occur throughout Wednesday's session of the Senate, with the first vote being on the second attempt to invoke cloture on the tobacco bill. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. COVERDELL. First, let me say that I appreciate that so much of the Coverdell-Craig-Abraham amendment has been wrapped into this amendment we have just heard described. I have not had a chance to see the amendment. There are some nuances. 
What the Senator from Massachusetts characterizes as vouchers and choice, I characterize as common sense to handle a child that has been the victim of a crime. And I do not agree that that should be characterized as a voucher. It does not deal with the needle exchange permanently. It only deals with a couple years. But much of the amendment is the same. 
So then the core question--they both authorize funding, and, as I understand it, it is at similar levels. So the question is, what does the authorization fall against? And where are the pressures? 
The Coverdell-Craig amendment authorizes against a new revenue stream which comes from an increase in the price of tobacco. The Daschle amendment--I believe it is the Daschle amendment--from the other side authorizes against the current budget or the caps, so the pressure will fall against current programming: education, VA, veterans, all of that. That is where you put the pressure. I put the pressure against the new revenue stream. And I think that is more appropriate and much more likely to happen. I do not think it is near as likely to happen under the Senator's amendment from Massachusetts as it is to happen if this tobacco settlement weaves its way through the Congress and there is a drug section in it. It is far more likely to occur than under the Senator's amendment. 
I appreciate the fact that we agree on its importance, that much of what we have drafted has been embraced. But I think it is far more likely to occur in the manner in which I suggested. And I do not accept the argument that it is misplaced. Most of teenage drug abuse occurs in smoking, smoking marijuana, which 
is five times more dangerous than tobacco.

Mr. COVERDELL. One, as I said a moment ago, I am not very encouraged where we are because this initiative has fallen poorly against the goals of the Congress and the administration over the last 6 years. 
The interdiction budget has dropped from over $1 billion in 1991 and 1992, to under $700 million. It got down to $500 million in 1995. Flight hours that are protecting our citizens have dropped from 36,000 to 11,000. Ship days have dropped from 4,000 to 1,700 days. 
We had one experiment recently in the Coast Guard in Puerto Rico that kept 350-plus million doses of cocaine off American streets. These are all interconnected. 
The best thing we can have happen is for the child not to get ensnared into the drug war in the first place. I believe that you cannot deal with teenage addiction and separate it from the tobacco bill. I just do not think that is the right thing to do. 
I think they should be embraced together. I think, given the scope, that this is the No. 1 problem. Given the scope of it, the fact that it would be authorized to consume 20 percent of these revenues, it is perfectly logical and sound. And there would be a revenue base generated to do it. I do not see the revenue base standing behind the good Senator. And I equally am admiring of the work that you have done on this issue. I have respect for it. I just do not think that amendment which has come late--very late--in response to what we have endeavored to do will achieve a new, bold initiative on antinarcotics in the United States. 
I yield back whatever--I do not yield back the time; but I save it.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, from 1980 to 1992 drug use among teenagers was reduced by two-thirds. It was reduced in great part by the massive interdiction program and much of an education program that was voluntary. 
My point here is that the amendment we have offered to the tobacco bill, which shares an addiction problem with these new revenues, is a bold component for drug interdiction and drug education, the very points that the Senator from Massachusetts is making. 
The proposal he puts to the table is designed very much the same way. As I said, there are nuances that are somewhat different. I think the likelihood of funding for this bold program under the Senator's amendment is far less--far less. Yes, if it all came about, it would be augmented, but there are more than sufficient revenues in the proposal we have on the floor, which is a tax bill, to fund a strong drug interdiction proposal and a strong antismoking proposal. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as I was saying, when the debate was closing, several Senators acknowledged the importance of drug abuse, teenage drug addiction, but thought that, we are suggesting, this was not necessarily the appropriate time to do it, which I take great exception to. 
I think this is exactly the time to do it. I think that it sends the wrong message for us to be talking about teenage addiction and wrap our arms around it like it is only involved in tobacco. 
About 14,000 teenagers die from drug addiction every year. And, as I will enumerate in a bit, teenagers, parents, our society in general view the No. 1 teenage addiction problem as drugs. 
Tobacco is a problem and tobacco use among teenagers has increased by 40 percent. Drug abuse among teenagers has increased by 135 percent in the last 6 years. The figures used last week were that 400,000 people, according to CDC, die each year of smoking-related illnesses. We are dissecting those numbers. I do not dispute them. But the point I make, Mr. President, is that of course this is of the entire population. You can't just measure the effects of teenage drug abuse by measuring the deaths. Fourteen thousand young people die each year, but the societal cost of drugs to our society are just staggering. 
Illegal drugs, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, represents $67 billion in an annual drain on the United States. According to the University of Southern California, it is $76 billion. And 80 percent of all prisoners, whether they are in a local jail or Federal prison, today are there on drug-related charges--direct or indirect. 
When you look at the scope of the prison population in the United States today, you might as well look at it and say, well, there is the drug-related causes. It is a staggering sum of money. And it produces--remembering that those folks who finally find their way to prison are but a dot on the map as compared to the incidents related to this--these are the handful that the system finally ensnares and gets in prison and is not even a measure of all which has occurred and who have not been apprehended or somehow interacted with the system and never ended up in prison. 
We have had a lot of discussions in here of late about violence among teenagers. Our young society is becoming more violent. It is directly related to an increasing consumption and use of drugs by our younger population. It is an epidemic of enormous proportions, and the reach of it is stunning and staggering. 
I guess where the other side was headed was that the cost of confronting teenage drug addiction would somehow interfere with the attack on the teenage smoke addiction. First of all, over 25 years, if fully appropriated, this amendment would use 14 percent of the funds raised through the tax hike the other side envisions. Over 10 years, this amendment would consume 23 percent and, over 5 years, 23 percent, in rounded off figures; over 25 years, 14 percent; over 10 years and 5 years, about 23 percent. 
If we are using 23 percent of the funds--and by anyone's measure, it is the No. 1 problem--if you want to reduce it to financial measurements, it is an equal problem. The cost to American society is as great on the drug side as it is on the tobacco side. The perception of parents, families, and teenagers is that it is a far greater problem, and in the data we have before us, it is an equal financial problem. So, why in the world would we ever come down here and talk about teenage addiction and not talk about the No. 1 problem--a problem causing massive violence, total disruption, and a financial partner to the costs of tobacco? 
This is how public schoolteachers rate the top disciplinary problems: No. 1, drug abuse; No. 2, alcohol abuse; No. 3, pregnancy; No. 4, suicide; No. 5, rape; No. 6, robbery; and No. 9, addiction. I point out that the No. 1 problem is probably driving all the others--robbery, assault, and the others. 
A national survey of American attitudes in substance abuse: What is the most important problem facing people your age?--that is, the thing which concerns you the most. That was the question raised for 1996 and 1995. No. 1, 31 percent--one out of three--drugs; No. 2, social pressures; No. 3, crime and violence in school. Not that it is relevant, but after you go through 10 or 12 different items, teenage smoking is never raised at all. That is among students. That is what students say. 
What do the parents say when asked the same question? No. 1, drugs; No. 2, social pressure; No. 3, crime and violence in school. It goes all the way down to getting a job, problems at home. At no time do the teenagers or the parents raise the question of smoking as a serious problem for teenagers. 
I don't agree with them. I think teenage smoking is a serious problem, a very serious problem. The point is that the most important problem is drug abuse, teenage drug addiction. 
Let me read from the startling results of the 1995 CASA survey of teens. Illegal drugs were cited as the most serious problem teens face, far above any other concern, well ahead of the 14 percent who cite social pressures. This question was open ended, meaning respondents were not provided with a list of possible responses, and it was asked early in the interview before any other question raised, the issue of illegal drugs. 
While responses to this question do not strongly correlate with the teen risk score, those who cite drugs as their biggest concern are no less at risk than the average teen. Some interesting patterns do emerge. Teens who cite doing well in school as their biggest concern are less at risk than other 
kids. They are more concerned with doing well in school, and it keeps their minds attending to other things. 
As I said a moment ago, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the total economic cost of drug abuse is valued at $67 billion annually in 1990, up $23 billion from 1985. Research at the University of Southern California using the same methodology estimated the economic costs of drug abuse at $76 billion, up more than $30 billion from 1985. 
I don't know the final disposition of this tobacco legislation. I kind of divide the debate into two camps; there is a health-related camp and a revenue-related camp. I am very concerned with the revenue-related camp, but it is my intention and I think the intention of several other members, we are not going to debate the tobacco addiction without including a strong and forceful statement on the issue of teenage drug addiction, the reason being, again, that teenage drug addiction is the No. 1 problem being faced by teenagers. It is an equal partner, in the context of social costs to our society, as tobacco. Parents, teenagers, science-based institutions, law enforcement officers--you can go anywhere in the country, any community, and ask them what the No. 1 problem going on here is, and they will say it is drugs, it is drugs. 
I had an Atlanta city traffic judge call on me a couple weeks ago. I didn't know exactly why he wanted to visit. He came into the office. The first words out of his mouth were, `Senator, drugs are burning the heart out of America.' He said, `I see it every day, and it is getting worse by the second, and we're not fighting it, we're not taking it on. If we don't, it will ruin our country.' 
Mr. President, this is the time and the exact moment, and appropriate in every other way, to bring to the forefront what drugs are doing to America's teenagers, what drugs are doing to America. As we make a conscious decision to deal with the health issues affecting America's teenagers, it is absolutely appropriate we talk about tobacco. We need to get at it. It is a very unhealthy habit, and it can be exceedingly costly. Teenage drug abuse has the same effect, and I might add that smoking marijuana as compared to smoking cigarettes is five times more deadly, five times more deadly. 
With that opening statement, I yield the floor.  
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I, of course, am aware of the longstanding concern of the Senator from Illinois about tobacco, but I think to suggest that some of the amendments that are being discussed have some meaning other than their stated purpose is not appropriate. The amendment before the Senate is an effort to make sure that any legislation that deals with teenage addiction embrace all the components of teenage addiction. Yes, smoking, but, yes, drug abuse and the smoking of marijuana which, I point out, is five times more dangerous than smoking a cigarette--five times. 
The principal drug abuse and addiction on behalf of teenagers is smoking, not cigarettes, but marijuana. I have long felt that for us to come to the Senate and talk about the dangers of tobacco and the addiction of tobacco and be absolutely silent on the question of teenage addiction to drugs is unconscionable policy. 
Mr. President, just yesterday on June 8, the President of the United States at the United Nations in New York said: 
Ten years ago, the United Nations adopted a path-breaking convention to spur cooperation against drug trafficking. Today the potential for that kind of cooperation has never been greater or more needed. As divisive blocks and barriers have been dismantled around the world, as technology has advanced and democracy has spread, our people benefit more and more from nations working and learning together. Yet the very openness that enriches our lives is also exploited by criminals, especially drug traffickers. Today we come here to say no nation is so large and powerful that it can conquer drugs alone; none is too small to make a difference. All share a responsibility to take up the battle. Therefore, we will stand as one against this threat to our security and our future. The stakes are high, for the drug empires erode the foundations of democracy, corrupt the integrity of market economies, menace the lives, the hopes and future of families on every continent. Let there be no doubt that this is ultimately a struggle for human freedom. 
Those are pretty lofty remarks, but where is the administration in support of our attempts to confront these drug cartels, to confront the fact that the target of these cartels are kids age 8 to 14 years old--8 to 14? Yes, tobacco is hazardous, and it has been abusive to health and it is increasing. Over the last 6 years, it has increased about 40 percent. 
What about drug abuse? What about these points the President made to the world? It has increased 135 percent in the last 6 1/2 years--135 percent. And his team, the President's team the day following these remarks is blocking votes on trying to make a component of teenage addiction embrace and confront drugs. It is OK to talk the talk, but you have to walk the walk. 
Mr. President, this administration does not have a good record on the issue of teenage drug addiction. It does not have a good record. It came into office--if we are talking about the troubles of drug abuse--it came into office, and it closed down the drug office, for all practical purposes. It came into office and it massively reduced interdiction efforts in the Caribbean and on the border. As a result, Mr. President, massive amounts of new drugs are flowing into the country almost unfettered. 
As a result of that, the price of these drugs has collapsed, utterly collapsed, and for some of these drugs, the price has dropped 70, 80, 100 percent--not 100--70 percent. So no message--more kids are unaware of the fact that drugs are dangerous. In fact, several years ago--2 years ago--that number was at the lowest ever. The number of children who perceived drugs to be dangerous to them was at an all-time low. So why are we surprised, if they do not think it is dangerous, that suddenly the use of it would just skyrocket and go up 135 percent? 
Mr. President, framing what has happened here is important: Quit talking about it; dismantled interdiction; closed the drug czar office; massive amounts of new drugs in the country; no message to kids or parents about the dangers of drugs--boom, a new epidemic, a new epidemic. One million-plus new teenagers caught up in drugs. 
Mr. President, there are 1.1 million prisoners in America today. Over 800,000 of them, 800,000 out of 1.1 million, are there on drug-related charges--indirect or direct. And $67 billion a year it is costing this country. 
The No. 1 problem for teenagers, according to teenagers, according to parents, according to all statistics--and not by a slim margin; by an enormous margin, 2, 3, 4 to 1--they have said that is the No. 1 problem our kids face, smoking marijuana, getting in the drug culture, the No. 1 problem. It is accessible everywhere, and it is cheap. The other side says, `Oh, this is not appropriate to be talking about this on the tobacco bill.' What in the world does it take to be appropriate? 
Five times more dangerous to smoke it, mind-altering, 800,000 prisoners, $67 billion a year, the principal problem of teenage addiction, and we just heard the Senator from Illinois: `This is a poison pill amendment.' The logic defies me, absolutely defies me. 
He talked about school choice. What he is talking about is three paragraphs in this amendment that says if a child becomes a victim of a crime, including drug-related, that the school system could move the child to another school. 
Mr. President, I will give you an example. First of all, we have a letter from the all-knowing NEA, which says, `This amendment'--this is the drug amendment provision--`to allow Federal tax dollars to be used to provide private school vouchers is a cynical attempt to use the recent tragic violence in our schools to advance a political agenda.' 
What they are talking about is the ability for a local school to take this teenage girl, who was assaulted at her school, sexually assaulted, in an abandoned locker room in De Kalb County--this amendment would allow this school system to move her to another school. That is what the ruckus is about over there. Heaven forbid that we would make it possible for one of these victims of a violent crime to be moved to a safer location. That is what he is talking about when he talks about the nonrelated issue of school choice. He is talking about this girl and the right for a school system to try to protect the victim of a violent crime. `But this is not a serious attempt to make the bill better. There's not any relevance here.' 
Fourteen thousand teenagers die every year as a result of teenage drug use. Once again, in the drug culture, the chances of rehabilitation are very limited. That is why you have to have massive campaigns to educate. The administration and the 
Congress have already understood this because they are trying to launch a national campaign now. And I applaud them for it. It is just too little. If we are going to get this drug epidemic under control we have to get serious. 
There was an article in the paper June 2, a pretty interesting article, Mr. President. I will just read a few select remarks from it.  
As commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard for the last 4 years, Admiral Robert E. Kramek played a key role in the war on drugs, serving as coordinator for U.S. interdiction efforts. But in leaving the post last week, after 41 years in the service, the 58-year-old admiral could not hide a sense of frustration and dismay about what he described as partisan bickering, pork-barrel politics that have hamstrung the United States in its fight against illegal narcotics. He said, `If we want to win the war on drugs, we've got to have the will to win.' He said, `While politicians have described the war on drugs as a high priority and a matter of national security, they have failed to fund it adequately, preferring instead to pour billions of dollars into other things.' He said, `Funds spent on interdiction represent 10 percent of the antinarcotic budget. Today [this is the admiral] I have two-thirds of the money, half of the ship time, half of the aircraft flight hours I need,' the admiral said. `And you can't get there from here. You can't make a 50 percent reduction in demand in the flow of drugs into this country over the next 10 years with what we're committing to the battle.' 
The amendment that the other side does not want us to vote on, that some on the other side say is not relevant, the amendment responds to the admiral. The Coast Guard appropriation for interdiction would be doubled with this amendment. In other words, exactly what the admiral said he did not have the amendment gives him. It gives him the ship time to get back in the waters instead of being in mothballs. It gives him the aircraft and the surveillance that he needs to shut down the Caribbean. 
The Caribbean got shut down in the 1980s, Mr. President. It got shut down. It was pouring into the United States. The will was put together, and in the 1980s it was locked off. It is not locked off anymore. It is pouring through the Caribbean again, pouring through the Caribbean. 
Now the amendment also doubles the interdiction budget of U.S. Customs. It doubles the interdiction budget of the Department of Defense. It strengthens the civil and criminal penalties for custom violations and doubles the number of border agents by the year 2003. 
Now, why all the interdiction? Because part of the reason that our teenagers, who are the target of these cartels, are being so affected by these drugs is that they are everywhere and readily accessible and cheap. If these interdictions are successful, the price goes up and the availability goes down. Price goes up. The other side is talking about the fact that price affects purchasing. It works that way in drugs, too. If the floor of the price drops out, you can buy marijuana as cheaply as a pack of cigarettes, what do you think will happen? The price affects not just tobacco, it affects drug use, too. And we have allowed the price to just plummet, too much of it, too accessible, too cheap. 
So the admiral is absolutely correct. If we are going to stop this epidemic, it is going to require a nation demonstrating the will. If the President is serious in his statement about our nations of the world coming together to confront the evil empires, then he needs to have a message sent over here to his team and say we want drug addiction to be a part of this effort. 
I find it curious, I have to tell you just at the outset, as to how you could have ever gotten into a debate about teenage addiction and been absolutely silent on the No. 1 problem, addictive problem, teenagers are facing. I find it incredulous. Then to make matters even worse, some lame argument that it isn't relative. First of all, the majority of the teenagers using it, smoke it. It is a product that is smoked, just like tobacco. The only difference is it is five times more dangerous. National Institute on Drug Abuse and National Institutes of Health say: 
Someone who smokes marijuana regularly may have many of the same respiratory problems that tobacco smokers have. These individuals may have daily cough and phlegm, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and more frequent chest colds. Continuing to smoke marijuana can lead to abnormal functioning of lung tissue injured or destroyed by marijuana smoke. Regardless of the THC content, the amount of tar inhaled by marijuana smokers and the level of carbon monoxide absorbed are three to five times greater than tobacco smokers. This may be due to the marijuana users' inhaling more deeply and holding the smoke in the lungs. 
But it is not relevant? What a puzzle. I have been trying to figure the logic. Just try to match that paragraph with the suggestion that this amendment is not relevant to this issue. Nonsense. It is the No. 1 issue. No. 1 for parents, for teenagers, for our society, for this country. It is an epidemic. 
We had a lot of discussion about the fact that tobacco is focused on youngsters--and that is horrible--but the cartels are totally focused on teenagers, age 8 to 14. It is the first war that has ever been waged against kids that we are in the middle of. 
So we suggest an amendment, if this legislation becomes law, that says 20 percent of the resources, 20 percent, are to be focused on the Nation's No. 1 problem. I think that leaves 80 percent to deal with what is, among families and 
teenagers, the eighth most serious problem. 
I see the coauthor of this amendment has arrived on the floor. I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. There are so many numbers that we talk about here. We often talk about how complicated it gets. But when the Senator talks about the magnitude of this issue, I think there are two figures that have been spellbinding to me, and it fits so much with what the Senator is saying. 
What all this means is that today one in four--that is 25 percent--of high school students are using drugs now regularly--one in four. Most of them are smoking it. They smoke it. But they say it is not relevant--1 in 10 junior high schools students. When the Senator was talking about the number of students that are affected by this, the number of deaths, 25 percent of the high school population in the United States and 10 percent of the junior high population in the United States. 
I just wanted to make that point.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, working off the remarks of the Senator from Idaho, which I appreciated very much--not only his cooperation in joining in the amendment in the first place but the energy and intellect that he has brought to the discussion since that time--as he was talking, I was reminded of a meeting that occurred, probably, now, some 2 years ago. 
I was encouraged to stop by a female youth detention center in the middle of my State. I really didn't expect that much from the meeting, but they gathered about 20 of the inmates. Their ages were 12 to 16. They were each given the assignment to tell about their own experience and what happened. As they walked--I was quite taken with the courage. It is not an easy thing. First all, the circumstances were pretty rough; and then they have to sit there and talk about it. But they did. They walked around the room. They were in the detention center for prostitution, assault and battery, attempted murder, car theft--and you name it--all related to an addiction to drugs. All of it. 
It was very moving, the damage and their realization of it. I asked them, in the meeting, if they could say whatever they wanted to say to the rest of the youth of the Nation, what would they say? Really quite remarkable. They all said essentially the same thing in different ways. They said, `Don't use drugs. Do not believe you can control them'--which is the point my colleague was making. `The drugs will control you. And do not use drugs to be anybody's friend, because if somebody is encouraging you to use drugs, they are not your friend.' They all had a sense of how dramatically their lives had been changed. One young girl said she was afraid to leave the 
institution; she just knew she was going to have difficulty breaking away from it. 
Cigarettes are a tough problem. But there isn't anybody in a youth detention center over it. 
Mr. President, as has been stated here repeatedly, this amendment is a very bold statement about what this Nation is going to do about drug use. I am not going to name the individual here I was talking with several months ago. Suffice it to say, the individual was the head of one of our Nation's most powerful agencies. I said, `Are we guilty of just taking on this drug epidemic in a kind of day-to-day, you just kind of keep the wheels turning, but have been unable to understand, as in the Persian Gulf, that this Nation needs to be bold and forceful and come down on this with a hammer?' He paused for a moment, and he said, `We are guilty. We are not paying enough attention. We are not getting bold.' 
That makes all those men and women out there on the front lines--two of whom were killed a couple of weeks ago, overwhelmed at the border, shot and killed. All those people out there--I am not talking about the teenagers for a moment, but the people trying to help them--get the feeling that we don't care. I am sure the debate they have listened to here on this amendment has not encouraged them: `This is not relevant.' This is relevant. This is destroying lives as we stand here and talk. The chance of recovery once the addiction occurs, once somebody is on this stuff--getting them off of it is murder. Our best shot is that they don't get on it in the first place. 
So, yes, we need advertising to dissuade people from smoking. In fact, we have been doing a lot of that. This Nation has improved the statistics about tobacco. All of you have seen it. You walk outside, in this new culture, and you see a gaggle of people outside the building smoking in front of the building. When you walk into a restaurant, we just take it for granted, but the hostess says, `Smoking or nonsmoking?' The flight attendant says, `This is a no-smoking flight.' Everywhere we go, in our culture, we are beginning to get a message: Tobacco is not healthy. 
We are making progress, and we should continue doing it. And I do not fault the underpinnings of the bill to improve the advertising. But it is flawed thinking, to think we can go to the Nation and say it would really help teenagers, and we would have been silent on the No. 1 addiction problem and the one that is undermining our society, the one that is so difficult to correct, if somebody does get snared on this. 
One of the provisions in this amendment gives Customs the authority to, up to 5 percent of their force, be able to move it, irrespective of collective bargaining agreements. There is a flurry of worry on the other side because of that. Why is this language in the amendment? Because Customs has to have the authority, from time to time, to alter the nature of who is present at a point of entry. They have to mix it up. So, we have this amendment which--as I said, it is limited up to 5 percent, to give them some flexibility to be able to maneuver who is at a given post at a given time. 
It is almost as if every NEA, Fraternal Order of Police, lets them dominate this war. For heaven's sake, we don't want a rape victim to be able to be moved or someone who is a victim of a drug crime, we don't want to give a school district the ability to move that student to a safe-haven school. 
Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes and describe in more detail exactly what the amendment does. 
No. 1, it stops the flow of drugs at our borders, and it doubles the resources for U.S. Customs, doubles the resources for the U.S. Coast Guard and doubles the resources for the Department of Defense. It also increases the antinarcotic capacity of the FBI by 25 percent and the Drug Enforcement Agency by 25 percent. In other words, I am responding to the gentleman I talked to a moment ago. It is a bold statement. It responds to what the admiral, who I quoted, said, that the Nation doesn't have the will to fight this battle. This says the Nation does have the will and is going to fight it. Then the accountability will be up to the admirals. We are going to give them the materiel to fight the fight, and then they better win it. 
It strengthens the civil and criminal penalties for Customs violations and doubles the number of border agents by the year 2003. 
It protects our neighborhoods and schools from drugs. 
It has a title dealing with drug-free teen drivers, providing $10 million per year in grants for States that institute voluntary drug testing for teen driver license applicants and for States that enact and enforce laws that crack down on drivers who use drugs. Only five States do that, Mr. President. Only five States have expanded DUI to drug driving. So this legislation encourages an expansion of drug driving. 
Drug-free schools: It makes it allowable to use Federal funds to provide compensation and services to K through 12, kindergarten through high school students, who are the victims of school violence, including drug-related crimes. It creates incentives for States to provide an annual report card to parents and teachers listing incidents of school violence, weapons possession or drug activity, and makes voluntary random drug testing programs an allowable use of Federal funds. 
The drug-free student loan provision: It restricts loans for students convicted of drug possession, 1 year for first offenders, 2 years for second offenders and indefinitely for third. It restricts loans for students convicted of drug trafficking, 2 years for first offenders and indefinitely for second offenders. It resumes loan eligibility on an expedited basis for students who satisfactorily complete a drug rehabilitation program that includes drug testing. 
Drug-free workplace: It authorizes $10 million per year in SBA demonstration grants for small- and medium-size businesses to implement drug-free workplace programs and provides technical assistance for businesses through SBA. 
Drug-free communities: It authorizes $50 million per year to encourage communities nationwide to establish comprehensible, sustainable and accountable antidrug coalitions through flexible matching grants, and it allows up to $10 million of these funds to be used each year to encourage the formation of parent-youth drug prevention strategies. 
Mr. President, there is data that strongly suggests that if parents talk to children about the drug issue, the chance of their children becoming users are cut in half--cut in half. 
But if you ask students by survey or in person whether they are talking to their parents about these problems, they are not. Only about 10 percent of the knowledge that students learn about drugs are coming from the parents. That dialog is not occurring, which also explains why what parents think about the drug epidemic is different from what children think, and children are far more knowledgeable, unfortunately, about the drug epidemic than their parents. 
The other day I mentioned one statistic of, `Do your children know someone who uses marijuana?' The percentage of parents who think that is the case is 20 percent. When you ask the students, `Do you know someone who smokes marijuana?' Yes, over 70 percent. There is a disconnect out there, and that disconnect is hurting us. That is what this provision is meant to get at. We have to get parents talking to their children. 
One of the ads being used now from the drug czar's office shows a little girl sitting at a desk, and she is being talked to by a voice. The voice says: `There is a pack of matches there. Do you use matches?' 
The little girl says, `Oh, no, they are dangerous.' 
`How do you know that?' the voice says. 
`My mommy told me so.' 
Then they say, `Well, are drugs dangerous?' 
And the girl just sits there and looks at the camera. Inference: Mommy is not talking to the little girl about drugs. 
These provisions begin to highlight this dialog. 
Ban free needles from drug addicts. This has been very controversial, a dispute in the administration, the drug czar's office arguing there should be no needle exchange program. It almost came about, but the drug czar caused a change. 
I was given this pamphlet earlier this afternoon. It is published by the Bridgeport Needle Exchange Program of Bridgeport, CT. This is the kind of thing that a needle exchange program would move toward. 
The brochure says: `Shoot smart; shoot safe. Tips for safer crack injection.' 
I have to tell you, Mr. President, the Federal Government should have nothing to do with anything associated with this kind of activity. 
`Get your stuff ready. Have a cooker, water, syringe, citric or ascorbic acid, cotton or alcohol wipes ready.' 
It is your ABCs on how to use a needle. It goes through every step. 
`Get a vein ready. Tie off a good vein and clean with alcohol wipe. Never share a syringe or cooker.' 
Just all your tips. 
This legislation makes it absolutely clear that there will be no needle exchange program. It would be banned, and it ought to be. 
As I mentioned a little earlier, the Drug Enforcement Agency would receive an antinarcotic budget increase of 25 percent. The Federal Bureau of Investigation would receive an increase in the drug enforcement budget by 25 percent. It would require the registration of convicted drug dealers and provides $5 million per year in incentive grants to States that require convicted drug dealers who target kids to register with local law enforcement. 
That is the nuts and bolts of the amendment that we are discussing this afternoon, an amendment that has been criticized as being not relevant to the subject or issue. 
From the outset, I have been stunned that this legislation would be silent on teenage drug addiction. Myself, Senator Craig and others decided that could no longer be the case. 
If we are going to talk about teenage addiction, we have to simply make sure that in the center of this debate is the subject of teenage drug abuse. Why? Because teenage drug abuse is the No. 1 problem--No. 1--because it is costing our society $67 billion a year; because it has resulted in 800,000 U.S. prisoners in jails, in prisons, State and Federal; because it has caused, and continues to cause on a daily basis, the most violent, hostile attack on our citizenry and its property. 
As bad as smoking a cigarette is, it does not cause a mind to pick up a gun and murder someone. But drug abuse does. That is why we have seen this surge of violent crime among our youth that everybody is so alarmed about--drug based. And as we have wondered about the increase in mindless crime, just senseless and brutal--drug based. Drugs alter the mind, and they cause inexplicable activity and hostility that the rest of society bears the brunt of. 
Relevant? You bet. And this Senator, for one, any time you talk about teenage addiction, which I am glad we are talking about, we are going to talk about drug addiction because it is part of it. And it is smoke driven, the only difference being that it is five times as dangerous to smoke this stuff as tobacco.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is interesting how each of our States has experienced disasters in the last several years--you a 500-year flood, we a 500-year flood, and now this devastating tornado. In April, we have had four natural disasters in Georgia: a flood, an early freeze wiping out the entire first peach crop, and three separate tornadoes. No matter how many times you experience it, the power of it is just mind-boggling. I remember years and years ago, on the eve of my high school graduation in Lee's Summit, MO, being hit by one of these tornadoes that leveled 700 homes to the foundation. I have never seen anything like it. It was like a bomb hit. 
You are right. All of our colleagues have been so responsive, and it makes an enormous difference when you are faced with that kind of situation when neighbors and friends across the country are there to help. So I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from North Dakota.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are returning to the tobacco legislation, by previous order, and specifically to the amendment that I introduced last evening along with Senator Craig of Idaho and Senator Abraham of Michigan, which is now commonly called the drug amendment. 
To put this in context, Mr. President, the point that we are making is that you cannot talk about teen addiction and be silent on the No. 1 teen addiction problem, which is drug abuse. So the purpose of this amendment is to make certain that any legislation being considered by this Chamber about teen addiction and teen problems must also include a title to deal with the raging epidemic in our country--teenage drug abuse. 
Mr. President, in the last 6 1/2 years, teenage drug abuse has increased by 135 percent. Well, what does that mean? Does that mean that 10 more youngsters are using drugs than were 6 years ago? No. It means that almost 2 million teenagers are using drugs today that were not 6 1/2 years ago. 
This is a massive problem and it is a consequence, unfortunately, of altered Federal policy. We decided early in this administration that the battle against drug abuse would be altered, changed, downsized. The drug office was virtually closed, interdiction facilities were drastically reduced, the Coast Guard was diminished in the Caribbean, and we quit talking about the problem. Simultaneously, we entered into new trade agreements with Mexico, which enormously increased the amount of travel between the two countries, upwards to 4 million vehicles now. So that interdiction apparatus was down and the transportation across the border was up, and we quit talking about the problem. Well, consequently, massive amounts of new drugs came into the country, and because they were coming in such quantities, the price fell. So we had a product that was everywhere, inexpensive, and very, very dangerous. 
You can go into any school in the Nation and ask students and they can tell you the name of all these designer drugs; they can tell you exactly where to buy them, and in most cases, it doesn't take over 30 minutes. As I have said, the price plummeted 50, 60, 70 percent. Dropped interdiction, increased border crossings, flooded the market with drugs, the price falls, and the targets are kids, age 8 to 14 years of age. What happened? It doubled and almost tripled drug abuse among teenagers. 
Today, in high schools across the country, one in four are using drugs regularly. In junior high, it is 1 in 10. We now have almost 2 million more kids caught up in this lethal snare, drug abuse. To be specific about the numbers, in 1979 at the peak of the last epidemic, 14.1 percent of the entire teenage population ages 12 to 17 was using drugs regularly. The Nation said we can't tolerate this. And from the President to the sheriff, the whole Nation began to fight this epidemic. And what happened? 
By 1992, we had reduced drug use among this population by two-thirds. Instead of 3.3 million teenagers using drugs, we drove it down to 1 million. This is very important because it demonstrates that we can correct this problem. There are some in our society, and very powerful people, who would like Americans to believe you can't do anything about this. That is an utter absurdity. We have proven, and very recently, that you can attack this problem and make a difference. But in 1992, as I said a moment ago, we quit talking about the problem. And so today, 2 million-plus are back using drugs regularly. It is a very, very disturbing situation. It just sort of snuck up on us. 
A lot of our parents are not talking to their children about this problem, which is very unfortunate, because we know that if parents are talking to their children about this issue, the odds of the children using drugs are cut in half. It is cut in half. But if you went into a classroom, and there are 100 students out there, and say, `How many of you talk to your parents about this problem?' you would be lucky if 10 held up their hands. There is just not that interplay, which explains a little bit here this recent survey. It is most interesting. Forty-three percent of parents believe their teens could find marijuana easily. Sixty percent of the teenagers said it is easy to find. Thirty-three percent of the parents thought their children viewed marijuana as harmful. But only 18 percent of the kids thought it was harmful. It is just a complete disconnect going on here. Forty-five percent of parents felt teens had a friend who smoked marijuana. But if you ask the kids, 71 percent know somebody smoking marijuana. It is just a total disconnect. 
So one of the purposes and reasons of this amendment is to assert Federal policy, bold Federal policy that attacks this drug epidemic at every level--at the border, in our communities, in our law enforcement agencies--everybody. It substantially increases funding for interdiction and for education, and it attacks it at every level. If this is put into play, within 24 months there will not be a poll that has 21 percent thinking their teenage children knew someone who experimented with marijuana while 44 percent of the teens said they actually had. This disconnect will be ended in America, and you will begin to drive the numbers of teenagers using drugs down. But not if we bring a major bill about teenage addiction to the Senate and before the American public and never mention drugs and just totally be silent on it as if that is not a problem. 
Teenage drug abuse is the No. 1 teenage problem. It is No. 1. Myself, my colleague from Idaho, and my colleague from Michigan felt this almost is damaging if it is so much focused on teenage smoking, which is a problem, but it is a fourth problem. The first one is teenage drugs. So you would almost be saying, `Look, we are accomplishing something here,' and looking completely away from the fact that we are in the midst today in this country of one of the most singular alarming epidemics we have ever faced: teenage drug abuse. 
I am going to yield, because I see the Senator from North Dakota is prepared to talk here in a minute on the bill. 
But one of the saddest things about this whole teenage drug abuse epidemic is that in the last epidemic, in the 1960s and 1970s, most of those teenagers were 16 to 20 in age. Now they are 8 to 14. The cartels have focused. We talked about tobacco focusing on teenagers. It is an unconscionable policy. But the narcotic cartels are totally focused on a young teenage market 8 to 14, as vulnerable a market as could be. 
We will pay an unbelievable price--and are--if we do not attack this problem forcefully with the Nation's will, and boldly; not deja vu, just another day. We have to turn this thing around. 
Mr. President, I am going to yield to my colleague from North Dakota.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I suspect this most recent cloture motion has the potential of engendering some controversy. It puts into rather tenuous circumstances the amendment we are discussing, because if we cannot vote--if cloture were secured, this amendment would not be in order, along with a number of other very core components of the debate about this very contentious legislation. So I hope that is being thought through very carefully by all parties concerned, that this is a very significant piece of legislation that has an enormous effect on our country and there are some very important amendments that cloture could arbitrarily remove from the debate. 
I will leave that to the leadership and another day.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, returning to my amendment for a few minutes--I see Senator Graham has been waiting--I will take a couple of minutes and then yield the floor. But I want to reiterate the importance of this amendment that puts teenage drug addiction in the mix. 
I have said repeatedly throughout the debate that I think it is unconscionable policy to be talking to the country about teenage addiction and skip the No. 1 problem of teenage addiction, which is drug abuse. It almost is an extension of the silence that we have witnessed over the last several years about this problem. This Senator does not intend to allow that silence to occur here. In other words, the idea being we will pass a bill that deals with teenage smoking and somehow will have comfortably addressed teenage addiction problems is the wrong message. It certainly should be part of the message that we are dealing with teenage smoking, but we cannot--I repeat--cannot ignore the teenage drug issue which is, of course, related to smoking. 
I point out here, someone who smokes marijuana regularly may have many of the same respiratory problems that tobacco smokers have. These kids may have daily cough and phlegm, symptoms of chronic bronchitis and more frequent chest colds. Continuing to smoke marijuana can lead to abnormal functioning of lung tissue injured or destroyed by marijuana smoke. Regardless of the THC content, the amount of tar inhaled by marijuana smokers and the level of carbon monoxide absorbed are three to five times greater than among tobacco smokers. This may be due to marijuana users inhaling more deeply and holding the smoke in the lungs. 
A very large component of teenage drug abuse is directly related to the smoking of the most prominent drug abused by teenagers, which is marijuana. When they smoke marijuana, the effects and damage are far greater. 
Again, I reiterate, as I will repeatedly, you cannot talk about teenage addiction without the two. You have to talk about teenage smoking of tobacco, but you cannot be silent on the smoking of marijuana or the other drug-related abuses. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Michigan. I think his comments on the appropriate nature of this amendment as it relates to teenage drug abuse is absolutely correct. 
I was taken aback by the suggestion by a couple of our colleagues that somehow teenage addiction to drugs was something that ought to be left for another day. I suggest my colleagues need to ask Americans what they think the most important teenage problem is today. When you ask American families, not CDC or some think tank, but you ask American families what they think the No. 1 teenage problem is, it is drug abuse--No. 1, and there is not even a close 2. 
The Senator from Iowa has a chart from CDC that shows the numbers of deaths. Of course, that is over a lifetime of the entire population. It shows substantial more deaths related to tobacco than to drug abuse on an annual basis. I don't dispute the numbers, but I do dispute the point he is trying to make. He is trying to say that tobacco is the most significant problem, and I guess just measured against deaths, he is correct. But I wonder if he would be interested in looking at America's prison population, the millions of Americans in prison today. There is just one little kernel, one nugget that would be of interest to him, and that is that 80 percent--80--8 out of 10 prisoners in America are in prison on a drug-related charge, direct or indirect--80 percent of the prison population. 
Drugs are fueling havoc in our cities, in our States and communities because they fuel crime and they fuel violent crime, disconnected mindless crime. We all know that the nature of criminal activity, particularly among our juveniles, is becoming more violent. We have had a lot of discussions about it. It is drug driven. The fact that we are talking about addiction and silent on the most pressing problem facing teenagers, in my judgment, isn't even debatable; it is unconscionable. 
The Senator from Michigan alluded to it when he said we will be sending the wrong message, it will be sending a message, `Well, we've gotten to the most prominent, most difficult problem for teenagers because we have passed a program dealing with teenage smoking.' 
Teenage smoking is up. It is up about 40 percent, and it needs attention. Drug abuse among teenagers is up 135 percent and escalating as we stand here, fueling not only enormous personal disruption, family disruption, but community disruption as it expands itself into criminal behavior. 
Not long ago, I was at a youth detention center in my State. It was a female center. There were about 20 young people aged 12 to 16. They were in this detention center for prostitution, assault and battery, auto theft, attempted murder, and the root of every one of the crimes was drugs. The real reason they were there was drugs. You can walk into any school, I venture to say in any State, and you ask the children what the No. 1 problem is--alcohol, cigarettes, drugs? Ninety-five percent, drugs. 
If we are going to talk about addiction of teenagers, we have to talk about the combined problem. Yes, tobacco. It is not healthy for them to use tobacco products, and we want to direct our guns at that. But the most important problem, Mr. President, for teenagers is drugs. It is almost an extension of the message coming out of this city for the last 6 months: We don't want to talk about drugs; we will shut the drug czar's office; we will cut the interdiction in half. And we are surprised because suddenly we are in an epidemic of teenage drug abuse? The message was silence. To let a teenage addiction bill come through this Senate and be silent on drugs is unconscionable. 
I, along with my colleagues, Senator Craig of Idaho and Senator Abraham of Michigan, are not going to allow that to happen. We are going to talk about teenage addiction, yes; we are going to talk about tobacco, but we are going to put drugs in the mix because it is the No. 1 problem. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment before us, the amendment that has been offered by myself, Senator Craig from Idaho, and Senator Abraham from Michigan. 
I will take just a few minutes to frame in general terms the purpose of this amendment. And then my colleague from Idaho will address the amendment and outline its details. 
My good friend from Idaho will not be here tomorrow so he will be making a major presentation this evening, and then tomorrow I will return to elaborate further on the amendment. 
Let me first try to put it in focus. We are talking about teenage addiction, and have been for the last several months, specifically on the floor, over 2 weeks. I have been struck by the fact that a major piece of legislation would be brought to the floor of the Senate, proposed by the administration, to deal with teenage problems, and addiction specifically, and be totally silent on the issue of drug addiction. 
The majority of drug abuse among teenagers--the majority--is by smoking, smoking marijuana, which is a more lethal and damaging drug than tobacco. Yet, this legislation was silent on the issue. 
The amendment is designed to end the silence. Teenage drug abuse is the No. 1 teenage problem--No. 1 by any measurement, teenagers, their parents, or empirical evidence. For us to have dealt with this issue and to have remained silent would have been unconscionable. 
If I can for a second outline the scope of the problem. In 1979, 14.1 percent, or 3.3 million teenagers age 12 to 17 were involved with consistent drug abuse.

Mr. COVERDELL. Let me continue, for the Nation to step forward with the powerful will to drive down teenage drug abuse by two-thirds--two-thirds--for those people who think this is a problem for which nothing can be done, I remind everyone listening that when the Nation decides to commit itself to resolving this drug epidemic, it can make headway. For example, in 1979, 14.1 percent were using it. By 1992, it had been driven down to 5.3 percent--2 million less youngsters were using drugs. But then something went wrong, something has gone badly wrong. 
Since 1992, drug abuse by this same class of teenagers has increased 135 percent. I repeat, 135 percent. What does that mean? That means that drug abuse has more than doubled since 1992. Drug abuse is now affecting 2 million teenagers. It has increased by over a million. This is a devastating indictment on contemporary drug policy in the United States. 
The Nation's will must be rejuvenated. This amendment will do that. When this administration took office, we quit talking and hearing about drugs. The drug czar's office was collapsed. Gratefully, it has now been reopened. It was collapsed. The Coast Guard was diminished. Interdiction was cut in half. The country was flooded by drugs. The price of these illicit drugs dropped by 50 to 80 percent, so they became accessible at every 
corner and to any school in the Nation. If you don't believe that, just go to the school and ask the students. They can tell you the designer names of the drugs. They can tell you exactly how long it takes, and it is usually no longer than 30 minutes. 
So we should not be shocked that drug abuse is skyrocketing and is a new epidemic among teenagers. It is even made more sad by the fact that in the 1960s and the 1970s, the last drug epidemic we suffered, higher-aged teenagers, 15 to 20, were involved in the drug crisis. Now the target is age 8 to 14. 
We have been asking the President repeatedly to set forth the goals of his administration during his administration to arrest this epidemic. The response is that they will lower drug use among teenagers back to the level at which they took office, 10 years from now, in the year 2007, 2 1/2 Presidencies away. Our goal is to get it back to where it was when they took office. This is unacceptable. We cannot wait 10 years. 
So this amendment is a bold interdiction. It focuses on interdiction. It improves the antinarcotic struggle by Customs, by DOD, Department of Defense, by DEA, by the FBI, by the Coast Guard. It dramatically increases the funding of the interdiction budget. It stiffens penalties and it creates a communication program to communicate to parents and students about the dangers of the drug epidemic in which they live today. 
It is our intention, myself and my coauthors, that whatever passes the Senate, will have an antidrug component. It will not be silent on the Nation's No. 1 problem for teenagers. That is unacceptable. It will be an expression to reignite the Nation around the will to confront this epidemic and these narcotic mafia who are the most serious and dangerous the Nation has ever--I repeat, ever--confronted. 
I applaud the efforts of my colleagues who have joined me in this effort. We are going to have a vigorous debate about it. 
I yield the floor at this time in deference to others who wish to speak.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, when we return a week from Monday, from the Memorial Day recess, we will revisit the tobacco debate, and at that point I, along with my colleague from Idaho, Mr. Craig, and my colleague from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, will offer an amendment to the tobacco bill that would create a new section. The section we will be offering as suggested additional legislation for the tobacco bill will be a section on drug abuse and addiction. 
Mr. President, to me it is illogical--and I have been puzzled throughout the debate--that we would be talking about teenage addiction in the context of tobacco only. It is not good policy to talk about teenage addiction and leave out the single, most important crisis that teenagers face today, which is drug addiction, drug abuse, and the swirling epidemic that has engulfed our Nation. If we are going to talk about addiction, we must include a component that deals with the Nation's No. 1 teenage problem. 
Mr. President, in the last 7 years teenage drug abuse has increased by 135 percent--135 percent. Tobacco usage has increased as well--40 percent. That is significant, and we must attack that but not by being silent on a new drug epidemic in the United States. In 1979, 14.1 percent of the population age 12 to 17 were involved in drug use--that is 3.3 million. The Nation got serious and it said we cannot accept this. 
And by the year 1992, drug use had been driven down by two-thirds, from 14.1 percent down to 5.3 percent. This is important on a couple of points. First, it demonstrates to the Nation that you can do something about this. There are many in our community who would argue, well, we have just been fighting this forever and it doesn't do any good. That is totally wrong. 
We have demonstrated as a Nation if we get focused on this problem, pay attention to it, and if we do the right things, we will keep people from being entrapped by drug use. We went from 14.1 percent down to 5.3 percent. In other words, instead of 3.3 million children getting caught up in this, we have taken it down to 1 million--a two-thirds reduction. And then we got lazy. We quit talking about it. We made light of it. The interdiction was reduced. The drug czar's office was closed, for all practical purposes. We mothballed Coast Guard ships in the Caribbean. We turned our back on this problem. And what happened? Well, we should not be surprised. We are moving right back to 1979. You quit talking about it, you reduce the effort on the border, you shrink up the resources, and our youngsters get the idea that it is not dangerous. In the meantime, the cartels have become ever more sophisticated, generating ever more resources. They have as good a distribution system in this country as some of our most famous brands. 
At a hearing recently, we had representation from Customs, from the Justice Department, and from the FBI. I asked them at the end of the hearing, `How recently have you been to a school?' Well, none of them had been recently. I said, `You ought to do it.' Mr. President, if you want to know what is going on, go into any school and 12-years-olds can tell you the whole story. They can tell you how few minutes it takes to buy them. They can tell you that they are prevalent everywhere. They can tell you the name brands of all of them. And when you ask them what the most serious problem is, a few will hold up their hands on various issues--alcohol, cigarettes--but they all hold up their hands in unison when you say, `Are drugs the most serious problem you face?' All the hands go up. I challenge anybody to do it. They will get the same answer. 
Those kids, I think, are wondering what we are doing about it, what is this Nation doing about it? It is time for a bold response. And throughout this entire debate, there has been silence on this massive problem. One in four students in high school today in the United States is using drugs regularly. One in nine in junior high is using drugs regularly. Eight out of ten prisoners in any jail in America, anywhere in America, are there on a drug-related charge--direct or indirect. This is fueling crime in our country, with enormous cost consequences, and we are taking millions of casualties. If this evil force wore a uniform, we would have declared war on it. 
What else would take down a million kids--a million, and it is increasing--that would produce 100,000 crack babies every year and thousands of deaths--14,000 a year? 
The silence has been deafening, just deafening. We have been in a struggle with the administration over this, asking them to step forward. We are finally just moving on our own. The plan that they have given us says we are going to have an accountability period in the year 2006. The first measurement would occur in 2002. That is 2 years into the next Presidency. We need to be aggressive now. My colleague, in a moment, will describe in his 10-minute period the bold response. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from Idaho.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this morning the Senate will begin 1 hour of morning business. At 10:30 a.m., the Senate will begin the Iran sanctions bill under a time agreement of 3 hours. It is possible that some time may be yielded back on the sanctions bill, and therefore votes could occur before noon. The Senate will also consider the ISTEA conference report when it becomes available. Therefore, votes could occur throughout Friday's session, in an effort to conclude several important items prior to the Memorial Day recess. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding, in conference with the other side, that they are comfortable with allowing two of our 10-minute sessions to occur back to back and to then go to the other side--and I will begin that, but before I do, for just a couple of minutes the Senator from Oregon will speak to express his grief over circumstances in his State.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Arthritis Foundation on its 50th anniversary. Since its inception in 1948, the Arthritis Foundation is stronger than ever and is forging ahead with an increased commitment to providing help and hope for those who suffer from the more than one hundred forms of arthritis and related conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia and juvenile arthritis. 
Arthritis, in its various forms, is a major national health problem, affecting more than 40 million people in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predict that by the year 2020, arthritis prevalence will increase to 59.4 million Americans--one out of every five people, including 285,000 children. 
If that is not enough, the economic impact of arthritis is significant. I have been informed that arthritis results in 39 million physician visits a year and more than half a million hospitalizations annually. Medical costs and lost productivity due to arthritis are estimated at almost $65 billion per year--approximately 1.1 percent of the gross national product. 
Through it all, the Arthritis Foundation has increased public awareness and has help provide guidance for combating arthritis. The Arthritis Foundation, an Atlanta based nonprofit organization, supports research to find the cure for the prevention of arthritis and seeks to improve the quality of life for those affected by this disease. Further, the Arthritis Foundation encourages people with arthritis to seek early diagnosis and treatment, and provides programs to facilitate self-management. 
The Arthritis Foundation's sponsorship of research for 50 years has resulted in major treatment advances for most types of arthritis and related conditions. The Foundation currently provides $16 million annually in grants to more than 300 researchers to help find cures, promote prevention and provide better treatments. Since its inception, the Foundation has spent more than $200 million on research while supporting more than 1,700 scientists and physicians. 
The organization has informed me that they are moving toward a new era of public health activity that includes collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop the National Arthritis Action Plan. They are seeking support for the inclusion of arthritis in Healthy People 2010, the nation's strategic planning guide for health promotion and disease prevention. 
The National Arthritis Action Plan will focus on such elements as defining the nature, extent and distribution of the arthritis burden; identifying modifiable risk factors; developing creative and effective public health programs and policies to reduce this burden; and implementing and coordinating these programs and policies through partnership with government, voluntary, professional, private and academic institutions and organizations. 
The Arthritis Foundation also provides a large number of nationwide community-based services to make life easier and less painful. These services include self-help courses, water and land-based exercise classes, support groups, instructional videotapes, educational brochures and booklets, and continuing education courses and publications for health professionals. 
In the past 50 years, the Arthritis Foundation has funded research, increased public awareness and provided needed education and services. These major contributions have placed the goal of curing and managing the impact of some forms of arthritis within a realistic reach. I congratulate the Foundation on this golden achievement and wish it continued success in the future.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am going to be brief. This amendment is designed to end random audits. The IRS said they did not do them. I was suspicious. GAO says they do. 
The GAO tell us 95 percent of the random audits today are focused on poor people, and there are a disproportionate number of them in the South and in my State. I don't believe it is the American way to have random audits. There is nothing in the return that suggests anything wrong and yet, bang, you spin a roulette wheel and out you come and they are in your face. It is unconscionable that they are in the face of poor people who are least equipped to deal with it. 
The GAO says to end these random audits would deny the Federal Government a precious $2.8 million. Late this afternoon, the Joint Tax Committee has said it would cause revenues of $1 billion a year. 
This is why people are so upset with this city, the gamesmanship that has to be played in order to correct something that is absolutely wrong. The rules are working against me tonight but I will be back. This GAO report shows conclusively that something needs to be done. We will have our vote tonight. In deference to everybody's time, I won't belabor it. 
I believe the Senator from Mississippi would like to speak on this from our time, and I yield to the Senator from Mississippi.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the hearings that the Senate Finance Committee has been conducting on the Internal Revenue Service--the adjectives that have been used to describe it are `startling,' `stunning,' `unbelievable.' I do believe most of the American public who have seen this unfold before their eyes are aghast at some of the assertions and allegations that have been made. 
Recently, I became very concerned that the IRS was still conducting random audits. They indicated to me that they were not. So I asked the General Accounting Office to verify to me that random audits were not a tool of the Internal Revenue Service. A report was issued dated February 1998: `Report to the Honorable Paul Coverdell, U.S. Senate, Tax Administration, IRS Use of Random Selection in Choosing Tax Returns for Audits.' 
On page 2, at the very top, it says, `IRS officials did identify 6 projects involving subpopulations of taxpayers with indications of noncompliance from which taxpayers were randomly selected for audit.' Let me repeat that--`from which taxpayers were randomly selected for audit.' 
I made a public statement of deep concern about the fact I had been advised they were not and the General Accounting Office said they were. On the same occasion, on or about early March, the Internal Revenue Service issued an interim memorandum to its employees, and they quote me saying the disclosures `are a result of General Accounting Office review requested by myself to examine random audits.' 
Then they told their employees that during fiscal years 1994 through 1996, `the IRS did not randomly select returns for audit from either the population of all taxpayers or all returns. IRS has about 40 audit sources which are programs and techniques used to select potentially noncompliant returns for audit. IRS audit sources do not rely on random selection from the population of all returns but IRS selects returns having characteristics indicative of potential noncompliance.' 
Here is the key point, right here in the publication from the IRS. There are three little dots, and then it says, `No taxpayers outside of these six subpopulations were selected at random for audit.' Dot dot dot. 
Mr. President, the `dot dot dot' is this sentence: `IRS officials did identify six projects involving subpopulations of taxpayers with indications of noncompliance from which taxpayers were randomly audited,' Dot dot dot. 
Now, the tax system is complicated beyond belief. Everybody knows the story where they gave a similar family to 50 accountants. It was an exercise that some major publication went through. They all turned them in. Not one of the 50 turned it in the same way, and not one of them was correct. 
So it is easy to make administrative errors. I have to tell you, Mr. President, `dot dot dot' is not an administrative oversight. `Dot dot dot' left out this sentence intentionally. It quoted everything else in the paragraph but left that sentence out. 
If the American taxpayers did that, they would be in deep trouble. This is why there is no credibility anymore. They just don't have any credibility. There are a lot of good folks over there. I have met them; I know of them. A lot of them have been very cooperative with our office trying to solve problems. But there is just no credibility. It is this kind of behavior--in fact, this is sort of tame. 
It is this kind of occasion that has caused an outraged population to call on a Congress to do something bold, to bring this kind of behavior under control. 
Mr. President, that is exactly what is going to happen in this Congress. The IRS is not going to be the same institution by the end of this Congress. 
Mr. President, I think the Senator from Ohio will be here momentarily and we will hear from him regarding his hearings on the Internal Revenue Service. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, whose professional experience on these matters is evident in his presentation. He makes an eloquent case for the reforms that are encompassed in the legislation to be offered by Chairman Bill Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee. 
Both the Senator from Wyoming and I have talked about random audits and our dismay about them being conducted by the IRS. A random audit is like Russian roulette. A random audit means the IRS, even though your return reflects no discrepancy, can reach in, pick it out with no cause and suddenly be banging on your door. This ought not to happen in America. The IRS should not be conducting random audits. 
I introduced legislation last week that will prohibit the use of random audits. We are told they are not being conducted, but they are. So we are going to legislate so they do not. I am very hopeful that at the end of the day, the work of the Senator from Wyoming, myself, and others will address the issue of random audits in the final legislation. 
This report that I received from the General Accounting Office shows that 47 percent of these random audits were occurring in 11 Southern States--47 percent in 11 Southern States. That only represents 29 percent of our population, and that 85 percent of the random audits were directed at people who make $25,000 or less--$25,000 or less. 
The first suspicion one has is, `Well, there's a person who can't defend himself.' 
I have come to know over the years a gentleman at Georgia State University who is a pioneer in tax clinics. There are very few of them in the country, but he got a Federal grant several years ago and got one started. They use university students to help low-income people who have had trouble with the IRS. They have 300 clients. He is a wonderful gentleman. We just rewarded and honored him recently. His name is Ron Blasi. 
He appeared at a hearing we had, Mr. President. This is what he said: 
Among those low-income taxpayers represented before the IRS by tax clinic volunteers-- 
Those are his volunteers; they do this for nothing-- 80 percent at the end paid less than the IRS claim called for. 
Eighty percent. 
That is not a very good record. And 8 out of 10--wham--who get hit with this audit hammer do not owe the taxes. So you have taken that taxpayer who has the least ability to complete the form--no accountants, no lawyers, trying to do it themselves--and you make them the target of random audits. 
He goes on to say--this was a story in the Marietta Daily Journal-- 
Auditing `pits one of the most powerful agencies in the federal government against people who don't have the resources to defend themselves,' said Blasi, who added that each year nearly 20,000 low-income taxpayers in metro Atlanta receive audit notices. 
I asked him in the hearing--I said, `What is the effect of that audit notice on these people?' He said, `Chilling and frightening, because they really don't know where to go. And often because they have no resources, they only get in deeper and deeper trouble because they really don't know how to deal with this agency.' He said, `Most of these people end up paying more taxes than they really owe if they don't have legal representation.' 
This is very discomforting. First of all, we said, `Do you conduct random audits?' And they said, `No, we don't.' And the General Accounting Office said, `Yes, you do.' Then in a memorandum to their own employees, they misquote the General Accounting Office and leave out the statement that says they do random audits. And then the General Accounting Office says, `And the target is low-income people. They're the principal target of the random audits.' 
And you have three chances more of being audited in the State of Georgia than many of the other States. Well, we have very rural and poor areas in our part of the country. 
At the end of the day, by the end of the 105th Congress, Mr. President, you will not recognize the IRS. This Congress is going to change this behavior. We want fair taxes. We want taxpayers to be held accountable. But this kind of targeting, this kind of misrepresentation, the kinds of stories we have heard--everybody in this Congress has heard this from constituents--bully tactics, arrogance, confusion, information that is incorrect, the chilling effect. 
We just heard the Senator from Ohio talk about a person who was sent a check from IRS. The fellow said, `Well, I don't think I am due that.' He calls them. They say, `Oh, yes, you are.' Then IRS finds out they made a mistake, and they charge the man a penalty. That is incredible. 
I met a fellow sitting on a plane--Mr. President, I think I have run over my time. I do not know if the other side is here, so I might talk for a minute or 2 until they get here. 
I will close with this. This is one of these fellows who is going to have a conversation with you whether you want to or not. And he got to talking about an incident with IRS. He paid his taxes. They contacted him 3 months later and said, `You didn't pay your taxes.' So he went down to the office, and he said, `Well, here is my check.' They said, `We didn't get it.' He said, `Well, here is the cancellation notice with the Government certifying it got the check.' `Hmm.' Well, they came to find out that they applied the check to his previous year's taxes. So that would have triggered a refund, which they never sent him. And then they said--and this is the key one--`Well, we're going to charge you a penalty anyway.' So they said he would have to pay penalty and interest rates 
because they applied the tax to the wrong year. He said, `That's it. We're going to court.' And they finally backed off. 
But that kind of activity has to stop. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. My hour has expired.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe that protecting our nation's food supply should be a high priority for Congress and this Administration. Today, America produces the safest food in the world, however, more needs to be done in order to make it even safer. We are increasingly becoming a global economy. Agricultural trade is on the rise. Due to these circumstances, there are new and emerging food borne threats which need to be addressed. That is why I am introducing a comprehensive food safety proposal, The Food Research, Education, Safety, and Health Act of 1998, also known as the F.R.E.S.H. Act, which will provide the additional tools and resources necessary to make our food even safer. I am pleased to have the distinguished Senator from Michigan (Mr. Abraham), join me as an original co-sponsor of this legislation. 
As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Subcommittee with jurisdiction over food safety issues, I believe this proposal could not come at a more critical time. The public is becoming increasingly concerned with the safety of their food. Over the past year, there have been increased reports of people becoming sick due to food borne related illnesses. Children and some adults became ill with Hepatitis A from contaminated strawberries distributed to schools through USDA's school lunch program. In addition, there have been reports, even as late as yesterday, of ground beef contaminated with the E.coli 0157:H7 bacteria having to be recalled from grocery store shelves. 
In drafting this legislation, my staff and I have had numerous discussions with the University of Georgia. Dr. Mike Doyle, Director of the Center for Food Safety and Quality Enhancement and Department Head of Food Science and Technology at the University of Georgia, is a leading food safety authority and expert on the E.coli 0157:H7 bacteria. We talked with others, including farmers, health experts, processors, and government officials, in crafting this comprehensive, responsible food safety approach. 
Several months ago, I traveled to Guatemala to investigate reports of unsanitary conditions existing within that country. This was prompted by reports of Guatemalan raspberries being contaminated with Cyclospora. While I was heartened and impressed by the investments and continuing efforts the Guatemalan producers have made in food safety infrastructure, there are still legitimate safety concerns we have for American consumers which need to be addressed. 
I believe we need to place a greater emphasis on food safety consumer education, research, and prevention efforts in order to continue to maintain our safe food supply. My legislation is intended to do just that. The F.R.E.S.H. Act provides for the following: 
Consumer education food safety block grants to the States. 
Directs the Department of Agriculture to carry out consumer education initiatives on the irradiation of foods. 
Establishes a Food Safety Council for the purpose of evaluating and establishing priorities for food safety research and education, and food-related prevention activities. The Council would be required to submit an annual report to Congress on actions taken by the Council, including any recommendations for improvement in food safety. 
Competitive research grants to study food borne pathogens and finding the best methods to reduce or eliminate them as a threat to humans. 
Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a number of demonstration projects to determine the epidemiology and ecology of potential food borne pathogens and develop interventions. The Secretary would be required to submit report to Congress on these projects by no later than December 1, 2001. 
Authorizes $5 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to pay for expense associated with the detection of food borne pathogens. This funding will be used for the employment of new scientists and the acquisition of new scientific equipment. 
Authorizes $5 million to enable the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct research concerning medical treatments for individuals infected with food borne pathogens. 
Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Food Safety Research Information Office in the National Agricultural Library. This office will provide the scientific community and other interested persons with information on public and private research activities on food safety. 
Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct risk assessments for each species of animal that is used to produce food in the U.S., at each step in the food chain in order to determine the risk of pathogens posed by the species. Risk assessments would also be conducted for each type of fruit and vegetable. 
Authorizes $10.4 million for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to hire new microbiologists and inspectors in order to decrease the risk of importing unsafe food products. 
Mr. President, food safety is a matter of utmost importance to me, and the American people. I urge my colleagues and the Administration to support this important legislative initiative.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Internal Revenue Service Random Audit Prohibition Act. I wanted to take this opportunity to alert my colleagues of the Senate that the IRS has identified a new enemy: innocent taxpayers. 
Over the past several years, all of us have seen news accounts of regular, average citizens who have become the targets of grueling IRS audits. These individuals were neither wealthy nor powerful; in fact, they were most often ordinary, law-abiding taxpayers who earned a modest wage, ran a small business, or operated a family farm. Some struggled just to make ends meet, and many were understandably confused about what they had committed to justify the scrutiny of the IRS. 
The truth is they committed no wrong. They were simply unfortunate victims of an IRS practice called `random audits,' where the IRS simply picks people out of a hat in the hope it can uncover some wrongdoing. 
A recent report produced by the General Accounting Office (GAO) at my request confirms that the IRS has been targeting thousands of poor taxpayers and small businesses for random audits. In fact, almost 95 percent of all random audits of individual taxpayers performed between 1994 and 1996 were conducted on taxpayers who earned less than $25,000 each year. 
Last Fall, hearings held by the Senate Finance Committee brought the IRS's abuse of taxpayers to the attention of the entire Nation. One witness, Jennifer Long, who is a current field agent with the IRS, remarked, `As of late, we seem to be auditing only the poor people. The current IRS Management does not believe anyone in this country can possibly live on less than $20,000 per year, insisting anyone below that level must be cheating by understating their true income.' The IRS' belief that low-income families are more likely to cheat than others services as a disturbing sign of how far it has strayed from the principles of American justice. 
The GAO report also indicates that the IRS has been specifically targeting my home state of Georgia for random audits. Nearly twice as many random audits took place in Georgia between 1994 and 1996 than in all the New England states combined and Georgians are three-times more likely to be randomly audited than their California counterparts. Furthermore, the GAO warns that we can expect that number of rise dramatically in Georgia over the next several years because the IRS believes small businesses in Georgia are more likely than other so-called `subpopulations' to engage in tax fraud. I do not understand why the IRS believes that Georgia small business are more likely to cheat than their counterparts elsewhere in the Nation. I still have not received an adequate reply from the IRS regarding any of these developments. 
Most of us understand the need to ensure tax code compliance through reasonable mechanisms. Where there is some indication that wrongdoing has occurred, an audit may be appropriate. But Americans will not accept the IRS's assertion that enforcement requires them to go after innocent, low-income taxpayers by using random audits that make no distinction between the guilty and the innocent. Honest citizens deserve better. 
The legislation I introduce today, along with a number of my colleagues, would remove random audits as a tool available to the IRS in its examination process. Victims of random audits would be entitled to damages of $5,000 after filing civil action, and the cost of litigation would also be recoverable. In addition, my proposal would require the IRS to identify the basis for audit in any notice to the affected taxpayer of such an examination. Finally, the effective date for these changes are set to the date of introduction. This puts the IRS on notice that Congress is deadly serious about the need to end random audits. 
I hope my colleagues will support my effort to stop the IRS from targeting innocent taxpayers. With passage of the IRS Random Audit Prohibition Act, honest, hardworking taxpayers can be assured they will be protected from unwarranted audits. They deserve no less.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is certainly nothing wrong with an amendment that tries to improve blue ribbon schools. But the amendment by the Senator from Louisiana guts the underlying premise of the bill. What is substituted here is pretty simple. You have 250 schools that would receive a grant of $100,000, or you have 20 million children and 14 million families that will benefit all across the Nation. In balance, there is just no comparison at all. So I would simply say again her amendment guts the underlying premise we have been debating for 6 months and exchanges assistance to 200-some-odd schools for 14 million families. 
I urge the defeat of the amendment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in a moment I will yield to the Senator from New Hampshire, but I do want to point out to the Senator from Massachusetts that so far, until we hear from Senator Gregg, the Senators who have come to the floor to speak about the education savings account in a favorable forum were Senators Byrd, Feinstein, Lieberman, Cleland, and Torricelli--all Democrats. Despite the difficulty we have had, this has been a very significant bipartisan debate--not as partisan as the Senator characterized. 
We will next hear from the first Senator on our side of the aisle in support, No. 1. 
No. 2, you are right when you say these statistics are befuddling. But at the end of the day, over a 10-year period over $10 billion gets saved in these accounts. Half goes to children who are in public schools and half goes to children in private. The construct of who benefits is identical, to the exact same people who were defined in the education savings account that the President and we adopted last year. It is identical. It is the same targeted community, same targeted community. 
The point that neither one of us can really settle, I believe it is statistically insignificant, the number of people --there will be some who will change schools because of the savings account. I think it is very limited. In other words, the reason that half this money--they represent a third of the people, but half the money in private, is because those folks are already paying the public school system and they know they have a higher tuition, so they save more. 
In that sense it skews 50/50. But it is still $5 billion going to public schools and $5 billion going to help students in private.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who made so many eloquent statements on behalf of the underlying bill. As is obvious, this has not been easy for them. They have been at odds with their Members in the caucus. We all understand that takes considerable courage. The Senator from Delaware, who explained the dilemma that he faced--and that I accept, but I appreciate his comity and the efforts to work through this long journey very much, even though he cannot vote with us at this point. 
To my adversary, the other manager, it has been a very civil debate. We even ended up in agreement on the reading excellence amendment. I appreciate the comments that came. 
I would particularly like to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, a very moving statement. It reminded me of my father. That is another relationship. He began his career as a coal truck driver in the Midwest. But when the Senator from West Virginia described the schoolroom in which that excellent mind of his was educated, I wish everyone could have heard it. While we all want excellent facilities, it isn't necessarily the key component in education. His came from a two-room building with two buckets of water. 
My dad's was one room. It likewise had no heat nor facilities. But that is for another day. I would admonish everybody to read the speech, though. 
Mr. President, the underlying bill is focused on children. In all these debates, sometimes it is buildings, it is tax policy, but at the end of the day what we are talking about is the desire of all of us to have the youth of our country be given a chance to fully participate in the greatest democracy in the history of the world. 
At one point in the debate I indicated that an uneducated mind is not capable of enjoying the full benefits of American citizenship and an uneducated people cannot and will not remain free. A core stanchion of American liberty envisions a citizen who can think well and participate. When we deny them those opportunities, as the Senator from West Virginia indicated we have been doing in growing numbers, we are condemning these people to something less than full American citizenship. The first thing they are denied is economic liberty. And when they are denied economic liberty, which is the second stanchion of American freedom, they are pushed to the periphery of society and before long they are pushed into those components of society that are a risk to the safety of persons and property, another component of American liberty. 
So at the center of maintaining our democracy is the duty for each generation to make sure that all of its youth are capable of participating in American citizenship. 
It has been alleged that public education is being abandoned here. I would like to point out that of the economic underpinnings of this bill, over 90 percent of it supports public education, whether it is school construction, whether it is assistance through an education savings account to come to students that attend public schools, whether it is support of all of our public institutions in State prepaid tuition policy, whether it is aiding employers in continuing education for their employees. A very small component, albeit a meaningful component, of the funding of this bill deals with helping families whose children are in private schools. But it is simply wrong to characterize this as abandoning public education. Far from it. It is one of the most significant new energies behind public education we have seen in a long time here. 
Just to reiterate--we talked about these children--there are about 53 million children in our elementary and secondary schools. The Joint Tax Committee has repeatedly said that 14 million American families will be beneficiaries of the savings account. That means nearly half of the entire population in elementary and secondary schools will receive some benefit. We also know that because of the work to help prepaid State tuition, a million university students will be helped. And we know 250,000 graduate students will benefit from these programs that we are talking about here today, that 1 million American employees will benefit from helping employers assist them in continuing education, and that at least 500 new schools in high-population areas and rural areas will be helped here. 
This is a very large piece of legislation affecting literally millions of Americans across the country on the basic belief that an educated mind is an absolute essential requirement for full citizenship in this American democracy. 
Mr. President, I know we have had our differences. I think this is the beginning of a long debate. It could be upwards to a decade. I am pleased that the minority leader has agreed that the status quo is unacceptable. If we have at least achieved that, it has been a major breakthrough. 
In closing, I thank all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for an incredible amount of patience. The hour is near. 
On behalf of the leader, for the information of all Senators, these next two votes will be the last votes of the evening. The Senate will convene tomorrow at 10 a.m. and debate the State Department reorganization conference report under the parameters of the consent agreement of March 31. However, no votes will occur during Friday's session of the Senate. 
On Monday, the Senate will debate the NATO treaty beginning at 12 noon. It is the leader's hope that we will have vigorous debate and, hopefully, even have a few amendments offered on Monday. 
I announce to my colleagues that the next vote will occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, April 27. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage of the education bill.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, certainly the amendment of the Senator from Michigan is a thoughtful one. But as has been noted by the Finance chairman, it completely makes moot a core principle of the underlying bill, and for that reason I oppose it. 
I don't dispute the numbers that are demonstrated in his chart, but I would like to elaborate on them. 
The education savings account essentially takes the education savings account that was celebrated and signed by the President last year, $500 per year to be saved, and it could only be used for higher education. The proposal before us takes that idea in its identical form and expands the $500 to $2,000 and says you can use it in kindergarten through college. So it broadens the capacity of it. 
These numbers refer to kindergarten through high school only and do not look at the cap in these accounts--that is very difficult to project--saved for college. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, what that really means is that the tax relief, which is very modest for those that are in public school, is about $250 million over 5 years, and for those in private school it is about $250 million. There are more families using it in public schools, as is noted on the chart. About 70 percent of what we estimate to be 14 million families will use the savings account, and 70 percent of them will have children in public schools and 30 percent in private. 
The reason it starts to equal itself in the distribution is that people who have children in private schools recognize that they are paying for the public schools with their property tax base and they have to pay for the private school education on top of that. So they have to save more. They have a higher bar to reach. I agree. They will therefore, likely save more, which means there will be more interest that is earned, which means they would have a higher proportion of this very small account. 
In closing, I simply say that by offering a tax incentive over 5 years of $500 million-odd, which is modest in this big picture, it causes Americans to do a very big thing. They go out and save $5 billion, all of which will be used for 20 million children no matter where they are in school--public, private, or home--to help get them ready for the new century. 
Mr. President, I will conclude my remarks and yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. COVERDELL. I was very glad to do so. 
If I might, Mr. President, for administrative clarification, I believe the sequence of events will be something like this. We are going to now take up the amendment being offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, and there will be a vote. I think the Senator would prefer that a vote occur after his debate. The Levin, Boxer, and Bingaman amendments will be stacked for early this afternoon just before the final vote. There are two more Senators who will debate following the vote of Senator Dodd. I believe that is the description of the situation we have right now during the day.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there are so many numbers tossed around. Anybody listening to this debate must be somewhat befuddled. You try to step back from it and look at the bigger picture. 
First of all, the concern of the Senator from Connecticut about the funding of special education is a real one, but he has already alluded to one of the major problems, and that is this mandate, which is one of the largest mandates in American history, ordered by the Congress on local communities in 1975, and in 1975 the promise was 40 percent of the funding would be Federal, 40 State and 20 local. Now, the other side, until 1994, was in control of the Congress and never sent the check. 
Since we have been in the majority, last year we put in another $700 million. The Senate budget resolution placed special education as the top priority. Republicans are seeking an additional $2.5 billion over the next 5 years for educating children with disabilities. In fiscal year 1997, the President requested $3.6 billion for this IDEA. Our Congress provided $4 billion for it. In fiscal year 1998, the President requested $4.2 billion for this. We came up with $4.8. The President's proposal for 1999 proposes $4.8 billion a year for IDEA. Our resolution calls for $5.3 billion, a $0.5 billion increase. 
So, while the other side controlled the Congress, this promise was left unfulfilled. Since we have controlled the Congress, we have begun paying down that obligation. In the Republican BOOKS proposal, we proposed fully funding it. The Budget Committee is moving rapidly in that direction. We are not there yet. And we did it, and have been doing it, without gutting other ideas. 
So the additional money my friend from Connecticut talks about that ought to be fulfilling this promise--it is being done. We are doing exactly what he has asked that we do, and--comma `and'--we are trying to help 14 million American families individually take charge and help to connect them to the education of their children. We do not think it is mutually exclusive, you have to do this or you have to do that. We are doing both. So, since we have been in the majority, and the Senator acknowledged it, we have been moving to try to fund IDEA. 
This $1.6 billion that's referred to, that is tax relief over 10 years, and the $37, of course, is a statistical average, as is the $7. But it does not take into account the principal. The tax relief was only accrued because of the principal. For $37, you have to have $1,000 in the account; for $7, you have to have $250. But what it means is we will have taken this $1.6 billion in relief to the same middle-class families that the President designated last year, the same criteria, same concept, and the Joint Tax Committee tells us that because of that modest tax incentive, these 14 million families over 10 years--that is the 10-year number you are using--will save, in principal and accumulated interest, over $10 billion; 10 billion new dollars coming behind education. 
These $10 billion are not public dollars. They are private. They are willfully volunteered by these families. So it means that public education will get, over the next 10 years, in support of it, $5 billion. And private will get $5 billion. And, yes, the private represents fewer families, but it still means, at the bottom line at the end of the day, that there is $5 billion flowing behind public schools all across the country and there is $5 billion flowing behind private and home schools across the country. 
Those are very smart dollars, too, because they are in individual family checking accounts where people know exactly what the frailty or problem is of a given child. If it is a math deficiency, it is going to go to hire a math tutor. If it is an inner city student who does not have a home computer, it is going to purchase a home computer. If it is transportation that is needed for an afterschool program that we all want to encourage --it is smart dollars. Public dollars have a hard time doing that, going right to the problem. If it is dyslexia or special education, it will flow right to it. And no school board is going to have to raise the property tax to get ahold of this $10 billion, no State is going to have to raise income tax, and we are not having to raise taxes. This is volunteered money, and I think the value of the money is geometrically increased, it is probably worth three times other dollars because it is being driven right into the child's need. 
The point we do not talk a lot about here--and they are not in these figures, either--is that the one distinction this savings account has is that it can accept contributions from sponsors--an employer, a church, a grandparent, a sister or brother, a neighbor, a benevolent association. And as people understand this and they begin to connect to these ideas, there is going to be a lot more money in those accounts than we have even 
envisioned. 
Another point I would make about the savings account to my colleague from Connecticut, is that every time a family makes a conscious decision to open a savings account--every time they do it--there is a mental connection to that child's education. And every month, for 20-some-odd years, they will get a notice from some financial institution that tells them the condition of that child's account. It will remind them every month of the requirements and needs and will make them think about what those children need. 
I can certify that to be absolutely true because my dad and I did the same thing for my sister's two sets of twins. We knew we were going to have some problems with the financial burden. So we started putting a little away. It was not a huge amount of money when they had to go to school--but it was a lot. And if this had been in place, it would have been twice what we had in that account. I think we got it up to $6,000 or $7,000. It would have been doubled. It could have been tripled if we kept it 30 years and used it for college. There is a special ed feature of this, too. Because if the child has a special educational need, it will stay with the child until he or she is 30 years old. 
So, my point is this. We agree that special ed needs attention and the Congress has been a party in seeing to this, and it has created enormous problems and we are responding to it. I am just citing the numbers here. But we are doing it, along with other reforms. We are doing it with an education savings account. We are doing it with a school construction proposal. We are doing it, helping employers fund continuing education for their employees. We are doing it and we are helping support 21 States that have prepaid tuition programs for families to help get ready for the cost of higher education. Mr. President, 17 more States are coming into the picture. 
We are accomplishing the funding of IDEA--which we agree is important. But we are not stopping the other changes and other ideas to help families. My colleague mentioned somewhere, I believe, around 50 million are in our elementary and secondary schools. Mr. President, 20 million of them will be beneficiaries of these accounts, half of the entire population. Some will be more; some will be less. Some will save the full amount; some will only save part of it. Some will accumulate $1,000; some will accumulate the entire amount. But they will all be helped and they will all be reminded about the needs of those children 
Like I said, we are funding IDEA. We are giving parents new tools. We are giving employers new tools. We are supporting the States with prepaid tuition programs. And we are building new schools. That is the underlying motion here. 
Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I do not believe we need to be in a dilemma where it is either/or--do this and not the education savings account, or do the other. 
The Senator from Connecticut is correct that I will raise a point of order. The Congressional Budget Office has told us this amendment creates a new entitlement for special education, a program which has always been discretionary since its creation in 1985. This spending would be charged to the Finance Committee, which has already exceeded its allocation. 
Therefore, we conclude that amendment No. 2305, offered by my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act because it provides for an increase to direct spending beyond the allocation of the committee of jurisdiction. I, therefore, raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act against this amendment. I assume my colleague will move to waive.

<TEXT>
Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator indicated that the underlying legislation could actually be harmful. I am puzzled by that statement, somewhat stunned. And that we have not reached out. 
The first point I make is that the underlying legislation, in great part, has been designed by a colleague of the Senator from California, Mr. Torricelli, of New Jersey, who sits right next to her. The underlying proposal has a significant component for new school construction. The legislation was designed and offered in the Finance Committee by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, on the other side of the aisle. The underlying proposal has a very key provision to enforce or reinforce States that have prepaid tuition to help children meet college costs, and that was designed by Senator Breaux, of Louisiana, on the other side of the aisle. The underlying provision has a key component to help employers help employees who need continuing education, and that was either designed by Senator Moynihan from New York or Senator Breaux from Louisiana. 
So the underlying proposal, if you really want to add up just the financial impact, is 80 percent designed by the other side of the aisle and about 20 percent from our side. I guess in the general division of the issues, it is about 50/50. But the underlying proposal will make available to 14 million families and half the school population of the United States, or thereabouts, the benefits of education savings accounts that their parents or sponsors can open; will reinforce the prepaid tuition programs of 21 States in the Union, 17 of which are coming on board; will support continuing education for 1 million employees, 1 million students in these prepaid tuition programs, and 250,000 graduate students. 
I know we can have our differences about how to confront the issue of education. It is good that we are having the debate. We all want to improve it. We all want to get ready for the new century. But I don't think it is accurate to suggest that the underlying proposition would be harmful, A, or, B, that it is a partisan instrument, because it just is not. 
Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the first point I want to reiterate is, we do have to acknowledge, apart from the amendments, that the points I made a moment ago are all in the underlying bill: Education savings accounts for 14 million families, 20 million 
children. And I might point out, those savings accounts will bring--when you use the figures $37 and $7, you are only talking about the interest that is saved because we didn't tax it in a given year. 
When you talk about the savings accounts, you have to look at the principal, and what happens is, when we create them, Americans do very big things and they go out and save, over a 10-year period, $10 billion. That $10 billion--$5 billion will support students in public schools and $5 billion will support students in private schools, without us having to raise another dime. No taxes have to be raised, no property tax, no income tax. This is families stepping forward with a huge infusion of money. We are building new schools; we are helping employees with continuing education; we are helping millions of students with the costs of higher education. 
To the amendment that the Senator has addressed, let me just say first, the amendment permitting block grants is totally voluntary; no one is required to do anything. It is a 3-year experiment that says if California wants to keep the system the way it is, fine. If they would like to experiment with the block grant, they might do that. If they want to experiment with the grant going directly to the school district, they might. But nothing is ordered. 
Frankly, I am one of those who thinks the Federal system has become so ensnarled that it severely constrains and restricts local communities. We had a story here just the other day of a person--they couldn't build new classrooms. They needed new teachers, but they had to have the classrooms to reduce class size. Because of Federal constraints, they couldn't get it done. I think the idea of loosening the flexibility is good. 
With regard to testing, it is very controversial. There are many of us who believe national tests will set national curricula and that national tests will be designed to enforce our current--could even be designed to ratify the current crisis we have. 
My only question about national testing is this. Every week I read about the condition of our fourth graders, our eighth graders, how we compete with the international community. I do not find a shortage in this country of understanding the crisis we have in grades kindergarten through high school. We know a third of the students get there and can't read right. We know only four out of ten of the students in inner-city schools can't pass a basic exam. We know if we take all the schools and put them together, only 6 out of 10 can pass a basic exam. We don't need any more testing. We need some innovation. We need some change and reform like we are talking about. We know what is happening. We are losing, as we come to the new century. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as we have noted throughout this debate, we have a lot of Americans who are exceedingly deficient in reading. When more than 40 million Americans cannot read a phone book, a menu, or the directions on a medicine bottle, and only 4 out of 10 third graders can read at grade level or above, new solutions are needed--I might add, not programs, but solutions. 
This amendment, based on Senate bill 1596, the Coverdell-Gorton Reading Excellence Act, will help children learn to read. The reading excellence amendment would focus on training teachers to teach reading. Fewer than 10 percent of our teachers have received formal instruction on how to teach reading. 
My amendment would also send 95 percent of the funds associated with it directly to the classroom, which I know the Chair would applaud, as he has been the author of the money-to-the-classroom legislation. It requires that funds be spent on research-based reading instruction, methods with proven track records. It provides extra tutorial assistance for at-risk children, as well as literacy assistance for parents, so they can be their children's first and most important teacher. 
It is already funded. That is unique here. Two hundred and ten million dollars were set aside in the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations bill specifically for literacy work. However, this is contingent on the passage of an authorization bill by July 1, 1998. The House has already acted and passed a Reading Excellence Act by voice vote on November 8, 1997. 
President Clinton endorsed the Reading Excellence Act in his radio address February 28, 1998, and has called on the Senate to act. This amendment is a response to that call. I will read the actual statement on behalf of the President of the United States: 
But we need Congress' help to meet this goal. 
The goal is that we are on track to give extra reading help to 3 million children at risk of falling behind. 
He says: 
But we need Congress' help to meet this goal. This past November, the House of Representatives voted with bipartisan support to promote literacy efforts in the home, the school, the community. Legislation with these goals is now awaiting action in the Senate---- 
Not anymore-- 
 which means $210 million in targeted assistance is now on hold in Washington, not at work in our communities. 
We are getting ready to end that. 
So today I call on the Senate to pass this legislation without delay. We need it. Our children need it. 
That was the address of the President of the United States to the Nation on February 28, 1998. This is the answer to the call. The research is overwhelming. Most recently, the National Research Council, at the request of the Department of Education, released a report calling for a direct, systemic approach to teaching so that children can learn to connect the letters of words to the sounds they represent. Our amendment does this by requiring that proven scientific methods be used, ensuring that 95 percent of the funds reach the classroom, and providing teachers with the skills to help our children. 
We should seize this opportunity, as the President requested, to put our children first, which, I might add, is the genesis of this whole underlying proposal: Children first, system second. We have been fighting this system a long time, and we have bad numbers. It is time that we put the kids first. This amendment is in complete sync with the nature of the underlying bill and does just that. We know you can't have a free population, Mr. President, if it is uneducated. It denies them the rights and privileges of American citizenship. If you can't read a phone book or a medicine bottle, you can't get a job. If you can't get a job, you can't take care of yourself, you lose your dignity, you are robbed of everything that America is all about. 
Mr. President, on April 17, 1998, I received a letter that was signed by Jim Barksdale, president and CEO of Netscape Communications; Carol Bartz, chairman of Autodesk; John Chambers, president of Cisco Systems; Eric Benhamou, president of 3COM; Floyd Kramme, a partner at Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield and Byers; and John Young, retired president and CEO of Hewlett-Packard. 
It says a lot of good things about what we are trying to do here today, but the last paragraph is particularly poignant: 
In our respective businesses, we are creating thousands of jobs that our Nation's education system is not preparing youths to fill. The 21st century economy will depend on one resource more than any other--qualified people--and dominance of the world economy in the next century will shift to the nation that best educates its population. We are grateful that the Senate Republican leadership understands the seriousness of this challenge. 
Mr. President, I can't think of a more fitting concluding amendment to the debate than the Reading Excellence Act. People have to be functional in our society. This amendment puts kids first. This amendment helps American teachers to do this job. This amendment has been passed by the House. This amendment has been called on for enactment by the President of the United States and, through this amendment, the leadership of the Senate. I hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in a continuing bipartisan spirit at the appropriate time will vote in favor of this amendment. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

But I do appreciate the Senator's words in support of the amendment, and I am glad we are in a situation here where we can, by and large, respond to the President.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Bingaman's amendment. Under the Senator's amendment, $125 million is authorized for grants in the first year alone. It would create an office of dropout prevention in the Department of Education. The amendment would allow for the creation of a dropout czar at the Department of Education. 
As Senator Frist so eloquently stated when the amendment was debated earlier, he suggested as chairman of the Budget Committee's task force on education that we look to creative ways to assist all of our students, proposals such as the block grant, which the Senate agreed to only yesterday, which will allow States and localities the flexibility to decide for themselves how to best spend education dollars. 
Senator Frist argued that this amendment adds yet to the complexity of an already encumbered Federal Department of Education. I call on my colleagues to oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we certainly concur with the Senator from Washington that class size is a fundamental ingredient, a concern to everyone. I will simply say that perhaps there are two very meaningful issues that would affect that. 
We have just spent over an hour discussing a real bullet that is not a sense of the Senate, it is a real bullet that would free up over $10 billion to local schools to take care of whatever issue they have. If it is like the Senator from Missouri said, they had to have new classrooms before they could hire new teachers. They could not use the teachers if they did not get the classrooms. 
The Gorton amendment which has just been discussed would send over $10 billion to local schools to do just what the Senator from Washington wants to have done. They would be in a position and be freed to have resources to reduce their class size or to make more efficient the facilities for teaching in these local school districts. 
In a moment we will hear from the Senator from Arkansas, who brings a very meaningful perspective to moving these resources directly to classrooms and not letting it get siphoned off en route. 
So, Mr. President, with these two points--we have just spent an hour addressing the issue that the amendment of the Senator from Washington alludes to, and we have a real solution here that will be before us this afternoon that really gets to the problem--I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Arkansas.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I echo the remarks of the Senator from Delaware, the Finance Committee chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Michigan because its effect would make moot a core component of the legislation that came from the Finance Committee and to the Senate floor; i.e., the education savings account. If the Levin amendment were to succeed, it would have the effect of telling 14 million American families, `No thanks. We don't want you to create these savings accounts and prepare for your children's specific educational needs.' 
The number of children who would no longer have the opportunity to be beneficiaries of these savings accounts, guided to help them with their educational needs, would be over 20 million--14 million families, 20 million children. Public schools, private schools, home schools all across our Nation would be deprived of, over a 5-year period, $5 billion of volunteered money and resources that would be coming to the aid of America's children grades kindergarten through college. You would severely hamper the ability of families to prepare for the higher costs of higher education. Over a 10-year period, the effect of the amendment would be to eliminate over $10 billion of savings that would have been accrued. 
Remember, these moneys are volunteered moneys. They are moneys coming from the individual families themselves and sponsors, and no school board, no school district had to raise a dime of taxes.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to address the chart. The chart, with all due respect to my good colleague, is very misleading. Seventy-five percent of the families who open savings accounts will be supporting children in public schools, and 30 percent will be supporting children in private schools. Clearly, those families, or what comes out of the accounts, the $5 billion saved, is directly proportional to what the families are willing to put into the account. 
The families who have children in private schools understand they have a higher hurdle. They are paying public school taxes, and they have to pay the private school costs over and above that. What this reflects is they are going to put more money in their accounts because they have more costs to cover. Nevertheless, $2.5 billion of the $5 billion will go in support of children in public schools, and about $2.5 billion will go in support of children in private schools. 
The chart is nothing more than a function of which families are saving what. The entire cost, to cause all these billions of dollars to be saved, is $500 million over the next 5 years. So the entire bill, in support of private education, is about 7.5 percent of all this investment to children in private schools and the balance to children in public schools.

On the other side, it appears that there are four amendments that are yet to be considered. We, of course, would encourage any Senator that has amendments to come forward. The aircraft that has taken a delegation to the funeral of a former Member of the Senate from North Carolina was scheduled to land, and voting was to begin at approximately 3 o'clock. It has been confirmed that the aircraft will probably be a little late. So this will alert the Members of the Senate that the stacked voting will probably more likely occur around 3:45 this afternoon.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has characterized the differences here today as Republican and Democrat, and they are not. The dispute we are having here today is between a community that is defending the status quo and rejecting change and a group of Senators who are committed to reform and change. And they are not Republicans and Democrats, as the Senator from Massachusetts has suggested. 
The measure that is before the Senate is cosponsored by Senator Torricelli from New Jersey, a Democrat. The school construction proposal that is before the Senate was authored by Senator Graham of Florida, a Democrat. The assistance to these States to students that have prepaid State tuition assistance is authored by Senator Moynihan of New York, a Democrat. And aiding employees by facilitating an employers' ability to help continuing education is the suggestion of Senator Breaux from Louisiana, a Democrat. So this is a bipartisan proposal that is here. It is not a Republican proposal. There are many Democrats who are at the forefront of what is being discussed and debated here today. 
The Senator from Massachusetts also characterizes this as an education savings account as if there were nothing else in the proposal. As I have just said, yes, there is an education savings account in our proposal that is directed to helping parents, parents who have children in public schools, in private schools, and at-home schools. But there are also provisions in the proposal that aid the 21 States in the Union that have prepaid tuition plans. 
This proposal that is before the Senate, and I predict will pass the Senate, makes sure that when those funds come to the students, when they actually need them to go to college, those funds are not going to get taxed at that time. The full benefit of those State-prepaid tuition programs will be there for 1 million college students. 
There are already 1 million students in the queue in 21 States, and 17 more States are about to adopt such provisions. The plan before the Senate will aid employers in funding continuing education for 1 million employees in America--1 million. What it does is it enables them to spend up to $5,250 annually to help with the continuing education program. And that is not going to be treated as income to the employee, is not going to be taxed, a disincentive to offering the program. 
The plan deals with school construction, but it leaves the decision about what should be constructed to local communities. Senator Graham's proposal expands financing tools for local communities and high-growth communities to deal with school construction. 
So the proposal before the Senate is wide-ranging, from education savings accounts that help parents and students--14 million of them to be exact, and 20 million students to be exact --who will save in the first 5 years upwards of $5 billion, and over 10 years $10 billion. The suggestion is that all these resources go to private schools. It is simply not true. Seventy percent of the families that use these savings accounts, their children are in public schools. Public schools are a big winner. The division of where the money goes is about 50/50 because folks who have children in private schools save more. They know they have to have more. But it's their money; it's not public money. 
So all of these issues that the Senator has alluded to are embraced--maybe not exactly the way he would like them--in the proposal before the Senate: education savings accounts for parents, tax incentives for employers to help employees, the protection of prepaid State tuition plans, and school construction. 
Now, on top of that, we are going to have a chance to vote on an amendment offered on this bill by Senator Gorton. Senator Gorton takes a portion of the Federal assistance and removes all the regulations, like it has to happen on a `blue' day and a `green' Tuesday, or whatever. All the morass that the Senator from Tennessee, now in the Chair, talked about earlier today--strip those away from about $10 billion-plus that goes to the local States and they can do exactly what the Senator from Massachusetts wants to see done. They can build schools, they can hire teachers, they can reduce class size, they can develop after-school programs, they can build parks, they can do whatever they think, and that is $10 billion on top of which we have created a new pool of $10 billion. 
The other side wants to look away from that voluntary money in those savings accounts. This is money being brought forward by parents and friends of parents of children. There is no new tax that has to be raised. No school district has to raise their taxes to get the $10 billion. No State has to increase income taxes. The Federal Government doesn't have to spend more money. By this simple, small incentive, we are causing American families to come forward with billions of new dollars to help public, private, and home schools. They will hire tutors. I think they are smarter dollars than a lot of dollars we talk about here. Why? Because they are guided by the family to the specific problem the child has. If a child has a math deficiency in a public school, private, or home school, then the family can hire a tutor with that savings account they generate. If they don't have a home computer--and I might point out that only 15 percent of the students in inner city schools have home 
computers--well, they could buy one with these savings accounts. If they have a learning disability--dyslexia or something like that--then the family has a tool they can use to fix that specific problem. Public dollars have a hard time doing that. 
The Senator from Massachusetts, on several occasions, has referred to this tax incentive that will go to create these savings accounts. It is true that about $500 million is used as the tax incentive--just over $500 million. That is a newer figure. The figure the Senator used is a little larger than that, but that was the figure I had at the same time. It is about $520 million in the first 5 years of tax relief to anybody that would open the account, by not taxing the interest buildup. That modest incentive, that modest amount of tax relief is what generates $5 billion in savings. 
The proposal that the Senator was talking about in terms of school construction is a $9 billion tax relief proposal. Who does that go to? That goes to banks and insurance companies and Wall Street brokers. They will get the tax breaks on the school bonds under the proposal to build schools. On the one hand, we have $500 million of tax relief over 5 years to generate $5 billion of new savings. On the other hand, we have $9 billion of tax relief going to the holders of the bonds on the school proposal.

Mr. COVERDELL. My 10-year figure would be about $1.1 billion. Let's take the 5 years. In 5 years, it is $500 million in tax relief for 14 million middle-income families on the education savings account and over 5 years, over $3 billion of tax relief for the people that buy those big bonds. That is a very select community that can play that game. Then in 10 years mine becomes $1.1 billion for the 14 million families, and they save because of that, $10 billion. No one saves a dime on the savings proposed for the school bonds. That doesn't generate anything, except school construction. But the beneficiaries of the tax relief are a very select group of Americans. They fit in a very small percentage group. 
The point I am making--that amendment obviated tax relief for the middle-class Americans, the 14 million families; it took it out and replaced it with $9 billion in tax relief for, as I said, large financial institutions. 
I know my time is about to expire. How much time do I have?

Mr. COVERDELL. I want to reiterate that what we are talking about helps 14 million families who are the carekeepers of over 20 million schoolchildren. And every school environment is helped--public, private, and home. Our proposal will aid 1 million college students, 250,000 graduate students, 1 million employees, 500 new schools, $10 million in new savings. The Federal Government doesn't have this. This is coming from families, $10 million, a huge influx of new resources. 
If the Gorton amendment passes, there will be over 10 additional billions--not new expenditures, just freed up expenditures--for smaller classrooms, for new schools, or for whatever those States and local communities feel are necessary to get at the crisis and challenge that we all know and have both cited time and time again are occurring, particularly in kindergarten through high school. 
Mr. President, I believe the hour of 3 o'clock has arrived. It is my understanding that Senator Landrieu is scheduled to begin her amendment at this hour.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I want to make it very clear that the education savings accounts would inure to the benefit of 14 million American families. The initial amount of money saved would be $5 billion. 
The example that the Senator from Louisiana offers doesn't really paint the picture. The $30 she talks about is, of course, averaging everybody out, and that is the interest only. She has forgotten that it is the interest on a lot of principal. 
We have said from the outset, one of the surprises about this education savings account is the tax relief involved over 5 years is only a little over $500 million. But that little amount makes Americans do big things. Because of that simple, small incentive, they go out and save $5 billion to put behind education. 
This blue-ribbon proposal would end up helping maybe 400 schools in America. They would be schools that have been generally better off. What we are talking about is helping 14 million families deal with the situation in all the schools that 20 million children attend. That might be a school that would in no way be able to compete for one of these excellence awards. 
Very few of your inner city schools could meet these standards. 
So what do you want, 400 schools that get $300,000 a year for the building, or 14 million families and 20 million kids having an ability to buy a home computer or a tutor? To me, there is no decision to make here. Do you want lots and lots of Americans opening up savings accounts trying to help their children with whatever the specific needs are, or do you want a specialized program that rewards the students in 400 schools? That is fine, but as a substitute for what we are talking about, there is no comparison. 
Madam President, I yield back my remaining time.

Following those concluding remarks, if any other Senator wishes to debate their amendment, the manager will remain in the Chamber for additional debate.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I have the utmost respect for my good colleague from Virginia, but I do want to correct one statement that he made. He said that the underlying bill provides no provisions for school construction. That is not accurate. The underlying bill embraces the provisions of the Senator from Florida on the other side of the aisle that does have a significant expansion of funding for schools at the local level and, without creating a new bureaucracy, leaving all the decisions to be made at the local level rather than at the Department of Education. 
In the debate between the chairman and the Senator from Illinois, it is suggested that this does not carry that traditional, onerous Federal intervention with prevention. But I would just like to share with you that under this legislation, the Federal Government is required to establish a formula to allocate the school modernization bonds. 
The Federal Government would need to ensure that half the bonds go to the 100 largest school districts with the largest number of low-income children, and the other half of the bonds would go to the States and Puerto Rico divided in proportion of shares of Federal assistance according to the basic grant formula for the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965. 
The Federal Government would not only scrutinize the criteria and figure out who gets what, it would be required to do more. 
Under these provisions, a bond would only be deemed to be a qualified school modernization bond if the Department of Education signs off on it. 
The Department of Education would also have to approve the school construction plan of the State--that is a key one--or eligible school district. 
In approving the construction plan, the Department of Education is supposed to consider whether a comprehensive survey of the district's renovation and construction needs have been completed, et cetera; expansion of the Federal oversight, the master principle envisioned over local control. 
The chairman of the board of education in my State accepts the President's admonition that construction of schools is a responsibility of local government. There is already Federal relief in terms of financing, but that leaves all the decisions at the local level, like the President wanted to do in 1996. 
My State is spending over nearly $5 billion in school construction; $186 million last year for 57 brand new schools and for modifications in 110 additional schools. 
This proposal rewards failure, because it moves to where the job has not been done. Those States and communities that have been doing what the President appropriately said here, they do not meet the criteria anymore because they have eliminated the criteria. 
Mr. President, we have heard a lot during the course of this debate about how a modest tax relief for 14 million families is inappropriate tax policy. I reminded the other side that the definition of the tax relief is identical to the IRA we passed last year and signed by the President for college education, and all we have done is taken that proposal and expanded it to $2,000 instead of $500 and have allowed it to be used for grades kindergarten through high school. 
This amendment eliminates that proposal and that modest tax relief, which is about $500 million over 5 years and a little over $1 billion over 10 years, and creates tax relief of $9 billion--for whom? Banks, insurance companies and very, very successful people are going to be the recipients of this $9 billion. So we just take these little folks making $75,000 or less, $150,000 or less, mop that out--that's not good policy--and create tax relief on these bonds that would go to banks and insurance companies, and we all know who buys these kinds of bonds, these tax-exempt bonds. 
Out goes the little guy, in comes the big guy. 
Mr. President, school construction and quality of schools and the facilities are important. For as long as we have known, that has been a duty of the State and the local government. A lot of States and a lot of local communities have fulfilled that requirement. They will be on the short end of this proposal. 
The underlying proposal for school construction expands financing for schools, gives additional options, but it keeps the decision apparatus at the local level. And it does not create another Federal outreach, another Federal intervention, into the local process of school construction. 
I oppose the amendment on those grounds. But I am particularly concerned that it eliminates the heart of the underlying proposal, which is to create a modest--the families will not be taxed on an interest buildup, such a modest proposal that creates such a big response in America where 14 million families come forward and save $5 billion in the first 5 years, up to $10 billion over 10 years, and there is not a single tax dollar involved. These are voluntary dollars, an enormous infusion, frankly, larger than this proposal, behind the student--not the building, but the student. Those billions of dollars will buy computers and tutors and deal with special learning disabilities and cost the Federal Government, in terms of taxes not collected, a very modest amount. 
But this will go to buildings, and this will cost the taxpayers $9 billion. Conversely, this little proposal, the education savings account, creates $10 billion. There is no school board that has to raise its property tax base. There is no State that has to raise its income tax. There are no new taxes from the Federal Government. It is people doing it on their own, simply because we have said, we will allow you to keep your investment, your principal, and we will not tax you on the interest if you use it to help your child in school wherever they happen to be. 
The other side has repeatedly said this is for private schools. And 7.5 percent of the underlying cost of the underlying bill could help somebody who has a child in private schools; 90-plus percent goes to children and helps people in the public school system. So it is just incorrect--and the Senator from Illinois has not been part of that, but all morning long I have heard this business that the underlying proposal is for private schools. It is just not the case. 
Seventy percent of the families who use these savings accounts have children in public schools. Half the money that is generated--and it is their money--would go to support children in public; half of it would go to support children in private. Tax relief that would be associated with private is about $200 million over 5 years, or about 7 percent of the cost of this bill. 
Mr. President, I yield back whatever is left of my 10 minutes.

<TEXT>
Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I reiterate in the underlying proposal there is a concern about school construction. In that sense, there is a sharing of concern with the Senator from Illinois. We have a different view about how to come to it. 
I believe, as I said, this proposal moves to failure. A State that has met its responsibilities and kept schools up to the level they should be doesn't meet the criteria in the amendment for the funding. 
The second point, and probably for me the most significant, is that this amendment obviates and destroys the education savings account that we have been discussing now for almost 6 months. This education savings account offers modest tax relief, which causes Americans to do very big things. About $500 million-plus tax relief on the interest buildup in the savings account will cause 14 million families, according to the Joint Tax Committee, to open such an account and save, of their own money, $5 billion in 5 years, over $10 billion in 10 years, all of which comes to the direct support of a child's need--tutor, computer, transportation, afterschool program, uniform; it goes on. 
So with just a modest incentive offered from the Federal Government, we cause Americans to step forward and give massive support to education. 
Now, that is taken out of the bill and exchanged for something that takes $9 billion of Federal money, doesn't create a dime on the part of these families, and this tax relief goes to the financiers. A certain segment of it can only be managed by banks and insurance companies, and the balance of it certainly will gravitate to the wealthiest of our society. 
So we kick out these average families--middle-income families. They cannot open a savings account and save this modest tax on their interest. That goes in the trash can. But the big dollars for big investors comes forward. The net exchange is, the Federal Government expends $9 billion instead of $1 billion and creates no investment versus $10 billion in investment. That is not a very good exchange. The little guy gets shortchanged. He or she cannot open a savings account, but the big institutions have an incentive to come forward. 
So I repeat, this proposal rewards failure, it creates a massive new Federal reach, new Federal intervention into what even the President says should be a local decision, and wipes out those 14 million savings accounts. 
I just say, one of the important features of that savings account that I think never gets talked about is the fact that every time the family opens it, from that point on, every month when they get the statement--not with their billions, but with their hundreds of dollars--every month they get it, they will be reminded of what that child needs for the school they attend.

Because of the large number of amendments on this measure, 
it has been difficult at times for Senators to know when they might make a comment. Senator Grams has been here most of this afternoon. Now that we are in this open period--and I know Senator Jeffords also was here--I hope that some accord can be shown our two colleagues who have been waiting to make a comment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with Senators Ashcroft and Brownback, a bill to prohibit the use of federal funds to carry out or support programs for the distribution of sterile hypodermic needles or syringes to illegal drug users. 
This bill would effectively continue and make permanent the ban imposed through the appropriations process which expired at the end of March. We are pleased that the Administration has decided not to use federal tax dollars to fund needle exchanges despite the expiration of the ban. But coinciding with this announcement, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala strongly endorsed needles exchanges and encouraged local communities to use their own dollars to fund needle exchange programs. This legislation is therefore needed to foreclose any temptation the Administration may feel to federally fund needle exchanges in the future. 
The Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, has laid out the strong case against needle exchange programs. Handing out needles to drug users sends a message that the government is condoning drug use. It undermines our anti-drug message and undercuts all of our drug prevention efforts. 
A report by General McCaffrey's office reviewed the world's largest needle exchange program in Vancouver, British Colombia, in operation since 1988. It found the program to be a failure. HIV infections were higher among users of free needles than those without access to them. The death rate from drugs jumped from 18 a year in 1988 to 150 in 1992. In addition, higher drug use followed implementation of the program. 
Dr. James L. Curtis of New York, who has studied needle exchange programs was quoted in the Washington Times stating that the programs `should be recognized as reckless experimentation on human beings, the unproven hypothesis being that it prevents AIDS.' 
According to recent scientific studies, eight persons a day are infected with the HIV virus by using borrowed needles, while 352 people start using heroin each day and 4,000 die every year from heroin-related causes other than HIV. Far more addicts die of drug overdoses and related violence than from AIDS. It is wrong to aid and abet those deaths by handing out free needles to drug addicts. We should not be encouraging higher rates of heroin use. 
Therefore, I hope my colleagues will join me in making permanent the prohibition on federal funding and support of needle giveaway programs.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I am proud to join my esteemed colleague, Senator Thurmond, in introducing legislation that will address a growing crisis our nation's military retirees now face. These soldiers who all served so valiantly for our country now find it increasingly difficult to access the lifetime health care promised to them in exchange for 20 years of service. As a veteran myself, I believe that the government must honor the promises which the country made to those men and women who have served so faithfully in defense of the United States. America's veterans fulfilled their part of the bargain--now the government has a responsibility to do likewise. The legislation we introduce today is a Senate companion to House legislation introduced by Representative J.C. Watts. Congressman Watts has put a great deal of effort and leadership into this issue and I applaud his efforts. 
Military retirees are the only Federal Government personnel who have been prevented from using their employer-provided health care once they reach Medicare-eligible age. In the past, Medicare-eligible retirees have received health care in military treatment facilities on a `space available' basis. However, cutbacks in health care funding, force reductions and base closures are forcing many Medicare-eligible retirees out of the military medical system. The legislation we have introduced today would correct this inequity by giving all military retirees health care coverage equal to our FEHBP health plan or the option to enroll in FEHBP. As you know, Mr. President, FEHBP is the same plan in which you, I, and all our colleagues and staff in the Congress, have the option of enrolling. FEHBP is a successfully administered health benefits plan. The least we can do is offer to our nation's military retirees the same choices in health care as are available to us. I dare say they deserve it. 
This legislation would do more than allow access to FEHBP to retirees. It would also allow retirees experiencing difficulties with the TRICARE/CHAMPUS health plans. Due to TRICARE/CHAMPUS reimbursement rates, which are 15 percent below Medicare reimbursement rates, many doctors do not participate in TRICARE/CHAMPUS. When a military hospital has no space available for a military retiree, the retiree is referred to a private facility. If a private facility does not accept TRICARE/CHAMPUS, the retiree is left waiting for available space in a military hospital. This is unjust. Under this legislation, military retirees who cannot receive under TRICARE/CHAMPUS the same level of care provided under FEHBP have the option of enrolling in FEHBP. Again, Mr. President, these are the same options available to us as federal employees. 
Mr. President, the Congress understands the need to fix the military health care system. Just last year in the 1998 Defense Authorization Act, this body recognized through an amendment I proudly cosponsored, the moral obligation we have incurred to provide health care to members and former members of the Armed Forces who are entitled to retired or retainer pay. This is a huge undertaking and important considerations such as the cost of such an endeavor must be made. While this legislation places caps on annual spending, providing those with funding concerns concrete numbers which to work, I firmly believe we can ill-afford not to honor the promises our nation made to these men and women. 
Mr. President, this nation has long stood by the men and women who have fought for, and secured, our country's freedom. Without these soldiers America would not stand today as the world's example of democracy and cornerstone of freedom. We owe it to our nation, to our nation's military retirees and to ourselves to make the small sacrifice that passage of this bill would require.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, the Labor Committee has already addressed the issue of new teachers and done it in a more expeditious manner focusing new teachers on inner-city schools. 
Second, the effect of the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts is to gut and make moot the entire exercise we have been at here now for 6 months. He would in effect deny 14 million families and 20 million children the benefits of education savings accounts, the majority of which are public, not private. He would deny 1 million employees the opportunity for continuing education and 1 million students the opportunity and benefit of State prepaid tuition plans and 500 new schools through new school construction. 
Later in the debate we will have another opportunity, through the Gorton amendment, which will be discussed later this afternoon, to free up from Federal regulation large sums of money, over $10 billion, which local communities and States can use to address teacher shortages, if indeed they have them. 
I conclude by saying the effect of the amendment would be to make moot this 6-month debate.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas. Federal funding should not discriminate in favor of same-sex education. Currently, it does. 
Same-gender schools boast years of success. Studies have shown that single-gender education worked well in the inner city. Seventh graders who had attended Malcolm X Academy in Detroit, MI --an all-boys inner-city school--had the highest math scores among 77 Detroit schools and the second highest in Michigan among 780 schools. Cornelius Riordan, a professor at Providence University, found that African American and Hispanic students in single-gender schools outperform their coed peers by nearly a grade level. 
This proposal simply rights a wrong without increasing burdens on the taxpayers. Right now, neither IX nor the equal protection clause prohibits single-sex schools. This is another example of how one size does not fit all. Parents and children should have the choice of single-sex education in public schools. As I said, I support the excellent work and the amendment offered by Senator Hutchison of Texas. 
I yield back to the Senator from Texas.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, it is my understanding that there are no more amendments that are ready for offering this evening. So, very shortly, we will move to closure. 
I did want to take a minute or two to reiterate that the proposal currently before the body that is authored by myself on this side of the aisle, and Senator Torricelli on their side of the aisle, is a bipartisan effort to bring about substantial change in education. 
The minority leader and I have a different view on the data coming out of our elementary schools. He suggested that we are doing pretty well in math among fourth graders, and near the top in science. I just haven't seen any data that suggests that. The data I am seeing suggests that only 4 out of 10 students in our big city schools are able to pass a basic exam. If you lump them all together, it only gets up to 6 out of 10, which is hardly something that America can count on to get ready for the new century. 
The Senator from South Dakota spent considerable time talking about the school construction proposal. I want to point out that there is a school construction proposal offered by Senator Graham of Florida that is in the proposal that is on the floor. It loosens, or makes more easy, the opportunity to finance school construction. It is not nearly as expensive as the proposal being talked about here. 
Just to take a moment or two, the proposal that was just outlined by the minority leader does raise some questions. I know in my State--I don't know about the State of the chair--billions of dollars are already being spent to build schools, to modernize schools, and that is because it is a State responsibility. 
As I was listening to the presentation, it was sort of running through my mind, well, are we headed toward a situation where those States that accepted their responsibility and built their schools and kept them modern are now going to have to subsidize States that have not? It is a curious question. As we have time to debate their proposal, I am sure it will clarify itself somewhat. But it certainly raises a question in my mind. I would not want a situation to occur where Georgia had fulfilled its responsibilities and some other State didn't, so now we are going to step in with a new proposal to make right something that perhaps is not. 
I think you have to remember that construction has traditionally been a State responsibility. However, Senator Graham's proposal does broaden the ability and make it more accessible for States to construct in this case immediately some 500 schools across the Nation. 
Madam President, I want to clarify one statement just before we yield for the unanimous consent requests. 
The minority leader said that our side of the aisle did nothing for public education. That is a pretty far-reaching statement considering that the proposal in front of us would help 14 million families finance education, 10 million of which are in public education, that would accumulate in the first 5 years $5 billion of new resources, $2.5 billion of which would go to support public schools. It would help 21 States plus 17 additional States that are considering prepaid tuition. It would help employers in the continuing education of 1 million employees. It would help 250,000 graduate students and would provide up to $3 billion in school construction over the next 5 years--public school construction. 
I not only consider that something; I consider that a lot, an enormous beginning in making the Federal Government a good partner in terms of improving education in our country--public, private, home, wherever it is occurring. 
Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to debate an amendment offered by the Senator from Washington that removes the Federal constriction, or constraints, or oversight on about $15 billion, that would allow local school districts to hire teachers, build schools, provide buses, or whatever the Governors of those States and local communities thought necessary. It wouldn't have the Federal mantra over it that says you only get these benefits if you do these things the way we say. That will be an interesting debate that we will get into tomorrow.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and his message with regard to the amendment that has just been offered by the Senator from Ohio. 
I would like to just reiterate several key points. 
The Senator from Ohio infers that the education savings account directs public money to a private school. This is not correct. All of the money in the education savings accounts is after-tax dollars saved by families, whether their children are in public schools, or private, or home schools. These are not public dollars, they are private dollars, No. 1. 
No. 2, the suggestion, to me, is egregious that if, for whatever reason, a family had chosen that their child would go to a private school, they would be disallowed from creating a savings account, as a family would that has made the decision to send their child to a public school. It is important to note that according to the Joint Tax Committee, 70 percent of the families who use these savings accounts would have children in public schools, 30 percent would have children in private schools. 
Mr. President, the education savings account that we are debating here today is identical to the education savings account that the President and the Senate and House confirmed and put into law last year. It is identical. That savings account that was celebrated on the White House Lawn allowed a family to save $500 a year, and whatever interest was earned would be tax free if it was used for higher education--higher education at the University of Georgia, or higher education at Georgetown just down the street, or higher education at the University of Texas, or higher education at Southern Methodist University. All we are proposing is that the account be allowed to be larger so it would be meaningful to save up to $2,000 and have the same criteria, which means that most of these benefits and most of these savings will flow to people who make less than $75,000 a year. 
But, again, I want to reiterate, the very criterion, the very instrument, which the House and Senate passed, the President signed, and we all celebrated, is identical to this savings account except that this savings account could be larger, more meaningful, and this savings account would apply to kindergarten through high school, not just college. It is the only difference. 
So I find it interesting that the Senator from Ohio would want to deny a family who has a child in kindergarten through high school from going to a private school but it is OK if they go to a private college, or to be worried about the income of the family that is going to take advantage of it when he wasn't worried about it when we were talking about a family that might send their children to college. Why are we suddenly setting a different set of criteria for families with children at kindergarten through high school? It is just perplexing. 
I want to reiterate that this savings account, on which the chairman is so knowledgeable on the concept of IRAs, is identical in who can use it, who can't, how it can be used, and how it can't be used as the House and Senate passed last year, signed by the President, and celebrated by everybody. The only thing we have done is to represent that it allow people to save more and allow them to use it not just for college but for kindergarten through high school. 
They can use it for college, too, if they want. They can use it, if they have a disabled student, after college. But it is the same as the one that was adopted. So these arguments are suspicious. It sounds to me as if this amendment is designed to defend the status quo. 
Now, the Senator from Ohio said, in effect, that we have some problems in kindergarten through high school, that some of the data, a lot of the data, are suggesting that we have people coming out of these schools who have trouble reading and writing and adding and subtracting. And so giving families tools that might help them deal with that, whether the child is in a public or private school, whether the child needs a tutor or a home computer, there is no American child whose family has made a decision about where they can best get that education, that we should strap or put an anvil around their leg over some philosophic exercise up here in defense of the National Education Association. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, again, I am puzzled by the vociferous opposition of the Senator from Massachusetts to an education savings account. I repeat what I said a moment ago when I was responding to the Senator from Ohio. 
The education savings account that we are proposing and talking about today is nothing more than an expansion of the savings account that has already been adopted by the Senate and House and signed by the President last year. Last year, we created an education savings account that allowed a family to save $500 a year, and the interest that was earned would not be taxed if the account was used for the cost of higher education. 
We have taken the same account--it applies to the same earning level, who can use it and who can't; it is directed to the middle class--the same criteria. There is no change whatsoever. Identical. That savings account can be used by a family to go to Georgetown down the street here or to the University of Georgia. 
We have said to those same families in America that we all celebrated because they have this $500 savings account for higher education, we are going to say instead of $500, let's allow a family to save up to $2,000 so they can really build up the kitty. We said, why limit it to college when there is so much trouble in kindergarten through high school? Let's let the family use it whenever they need it. They may need it when the child is in sixth grade because of dyslexia or a learning disability. They may need it in freshman high school because of a math deficiency. They may need it because the child cannot compete because of not having a home computer. 
We have taken the very instrument that was so celebrated on the White House lawn, a $500 savings account, and said let's let it be up to $2,000, and instead of just limiting it to college, although it could be used for college, let's let them use it whenever they need it--kindergarten through high school or college. No change. Same group of families. Same criteria. Use it in the same way. It is just bigger if they want to make it bigger, and it covers all the school years, not just some of them. 
Whatever all these concerns are that the Senator just alluded to would have applied to what we did last year. It would have had the same discrimination; it would have favored the same kind of families as his chart alludes to in that account.

Mr. COVERDELL. Let me respond to the Senator. I recognize there is a distinction with the public-private issue, but the Senator spent a good bit of his time trying to suggest that certain kinds of families would benefit; that the dollars are skewed, there was some formula here that was working against the public interest. 
My point to the Senator from Massachusetts is, it is identical to the formula that was used when we created the higher education savings account. Identical. It is just that folks can save more now for kindergarten through high school or they can save it for college. They have a chance to save more, and they have a chance to use it more frequently. 
The Joint Tax Committee has said that in this education 
savings account, 14 million families will probably use it; 20 million kids, that is half the school population almost. 
Here is the point that I would like to make to the Senator: What is amazing to me about this education savings account is that it takes such a little incentive to make Americans do huge things. The tax relief to these 14 million families over the next 5 years is just a pittance over $500 million--over 5 years. What do the 14 million families do because of that? They save over $5 billion--$5 billion. That puts 5 billion volunteer dollars--these are not tax dollars; no school board has to levy a new property tax; no State government has to raise their income tax; the Federal Government doesn't have to raise taxes--the people on their own, because of the nature of the savings account, save $5 billion. Seventy percent of those families will have children in public schools, and 30 percent will have children in private schools. About half the money will end up helping children in public schools, and about half the money will help children in private schools. 
Everybody is a winner here. There are no losers. A lot of times we do things in Washington and somebody gains and somebody loses. But in this case, everybody wins. The public school system wins; the private school system wins. People with kids in public schools can use the savings account; people with kids in private schools can use the savings account. 
I see I have just been joined by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, so I am going to yield to him. 
But everybody wins. These are not public dollars. These are volunteer dollars to help children wherever they are going to school. 
Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Indiana.

Mr. COVERDELL.

The purpose of the amendment to which he was speaking, and I read, is `to provide incentives for States to establish and administer periodic teacher testing and merit pay programs for elementary school and secondary schoolteachers.' 
When Senators Mack and D'Amato were here speaking for the amendment, they characterized what is important in a classroom in America is a teacher, is a teacher, is a teacher, which is the purpose of the amendment to which the Senator from Arkansas rose in opposition.

Mr. COVERDELL. First, I want to come back, as I probably will have to do all week long, to respond to the characterization of the nature of the education savings account that is a title--one piece--of the bill that is before the Senate. The Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from North Dakota, and the Senator from Arkansas have characterized the distribution of these moneys. I do not know where they are getting their figures. I think the Senator from Arkansas indicated that some 90 percent of the proceeds of the education savings account would end up in support of students in private schools. That is just absolutely and totally incorrect. 
Let me run it down one more time. 
This education savings account is identical, the same--I underline `the same'--as the education savings account embraced by the President, that he was applauding, passed with a majority of their votes, Senate and House, and signed on the White House lawn in a huge celebration. We were celebrating the fact that we had created an education savings account that would help middle-income people pay for the cost of higher education. That savings account that we celebrated, that the President signed and took pride in authorship, although there were a lot of authors, allowed a family, a middle-class family, to save $500 a year and the interest buildup would not be taxed if they used it for the cost of higher education. 
That is what we passed, that is what he signed, and that is what we celebrated. 
This education savings account is identical and for the same people who are middle class just like the others. The only differences are these. We have said you should be able to save more than $500. Let's let people save up to $2,000. If we are going to help people pay college bills, we better make it substantive enough that they will really do it. The second change is that we said, if you need it before then, you can use it. If you need it for kindergarten or first grade or third or fourth or fifth or sixth or middle school or junior high or high school, if the problem occurs there, you can use it, or you can keep it for college, or, if the student is disabled, even up to age 30. So we just took the idea for middle-income taxpayers and said we are going to make it bigger so it can be used in different ways. 
That is the only difference. And yet we have a parade of people down here saying this account is for rich people. It is the same people, identical, that they designated. It is for college. It is for 1st grade through 12th. Then they say, well, this is all going to go to a family that is sending their child to a private school. 
The first thing to remember is that it is the family's money. This is not tax money or public money. This is money that they reached in their pocket to put in the savings account. So it sort of stands to reason they maybe ought to have some say about where it goes since it is theirs. But if we are concerned about the distribution of public and private, it is important to note that 70 percent of the families who use the savings accounts will have children in public schools and 30 percent will have children in private schools--70 in public schools, 30 in private. The amount of money is equally divided, not 90 percent to private schools but equally divided. It is about 50-50. 
You could ask yourself, well, if 70 percent of the families have children in public schools, why doesn't 70 percent of the money go there? It is because the families with children in private schools know they have a higher hurdle to get over and they are going to tend to save more. They are going to spend more. But it is still about 50-50. 
They talk about the expenditure. This one is a little unique. But they seem to feel that if you leave a person's money they earned in their checking account and do not tax it, you have done them a favor. 
That argues that the Government owns all the money and decides what little pieces to give back to you. This is the people's money. The tax that will be saved by 14 million American families is $520-some-odd million for 5 years in a $1.6 trillion operation. We would leave $500 million over 5 years in their savings accounts. 
What is stunning to me is what it makes those American families do. They go out and save $5 billion. This is $5 billion that no school, no student will be able to take advantage of if we do not do this. It will never appear. So, by using this modest tax incentive, Americans do huge things. They save big dollars and every school system in America will benefit. Run down the litany--14 million families, over 20 million children, over $5 billion being volunteered to come in to back up education needs, without any local school district having to raise a dime of taxes; volunteer dollars, families stepping forward trying to help their children. 
You heard this is not a priority, just forget the 14 million families. They try to make the juxtaposition that this is either/or, it is a savings account or school construction. The other side needs to review and be mindful of several things. First of all, this is a bipartisan effort. The principal cosponsor of this bill sits right over there. His name is Senator Torricelli, from New Jersey. Another key one is right up here, and that is Senator Lieberman, from Connecticut. And right over there is Senator Breaux from Louisiana. Midway over there is Senator Graham of Florida. These are authors of this proposal too. 
It is not just an Education Savings Account we are debating. We have heard a lot about school construction here. They need to review the proposal as offered by their side, Senator Graham of Florida, which expands the ability of local school districts to finance school construction. That is right here. If school construction is important, it is part of the proposal. We have education savings accounts. We encourage States for early prepaid tuition. This encourages employers to pay for continuing education costs for their employees. One million employees will be positively affected by this. 
As I said, school construction will be a part of the proposal, and helping the National Health Corps scholarships. All of these are what the bill is. Education savings accounts, I think, are a very important piece, but they are just a piece. And, I might add, in terms of the--they call it costs--in terms of leaving the amount of money in the individual checking accounts, it is a minor cost as compared to the total. It is about 15 percent of this total proposal that is involved in the education savings account. So, once again, it helps families create savings accounts to help kids, a lot of them--20 million. It helps States create prepaid tuition. We heard a lot here about, `Let's get people into college,' from the Senator from Arkansas. That is exactly what this bill does. It also helps employers continue to educate people. It helps build schools. All of this is in this proposal. 
Having said that, since we have heard the Senator from North Dakota talk about the quality of a school--we want quality buildings. That is principally a State responsibility. We want to be careful we do not reward people who have not been getting the job done. There have been a lot of States building a lot of schools. If some haven't seen to that, it is not our job. You want to make sure everybody is being treated fairly here. 
The last thing I say on that is, my dad was educated in a one-room schoolhouse. They had all the grades in one room. He learned how to read; he learned how to write; he learned how to add and subtract. In that one room, they gave him the tools he needed to be a full-fledged American citizen. And that is the problem here. We have hundreds of thousands of children coming out of grades K-12 who cannot read right, and they can't add, and they can't write. And the numbers are astounding. In city schools, only 4 in 10 can pass a basic exam; put all the schools together, only 6. An uneducated mind is denied full citizenship and the privileges and opportunities of that citizenship in the United States, and we have too many kids coming out where we are stunting their citizenship, their participation. We have to stop it. 
There needs to be change. These are not all the ideas; they are some of them. Just to sit and defend the status quo is unconscionable. 
Mr. President, I yield whatever of the 15 minutes was left, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with the Senior Senator from Louisiana and the Junior Senator from Ohio. This legislation--The Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1998--will guarantee that the federal government is held to the same full range of enforcement mechanisms available under the Clean Water Act as private entities, states, and localities. Each federal department, agency, and instrumentality will to be subject to and comply with all Federal, State, and local requirements with respect to the control and abatement of water pollution and management in the same manner and extent as any person is subject to such requirements, including the payment of reasonable service charges. 
Last year marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Clean Water Act. This Act has been an effective tool in improving the quality of our nation's rivers, lakes, and streams. Over that period of time, however, states have not had the ability to impose certain fines and penalties against federal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act. This is a double standard that should not be continued. 
In 1972, Congress included provisions on federal facility compliance with our nation's water pollution laws in section 313 of the Clean Water Act. Section 313 called for federal facilities to comply with all federal, state, and local water pollution requirements. However, in 1992, the United States Supreme Court ruled in U.S. Dept. Of Energy v. Ohio, that States could not impose certain fines and penalties against federal agencies for violations of the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA). Because of this decision, the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (H.R. 2194) was enacted to clarify that Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity for agencies in violation of RCRA. Federal agencies in violation of the RCRA are now subject to State levied fines and penalties. However, this legislation did not address the Supreme Court's decision with regard to the Clean Water Act. 
The Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1998 makes it unequivocally clear that the federal government waives its claim to sovereign immunity in the Clean Water Act. The federal government owns hundreds of thousands of buildings, located on millions of acres of land, none of which have to abide by the same standards as a private entity does under the Clean Water Act. This legislation simply ensures that the federal government lives by the same rules it imposes on everyone else.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today, to pay tribute to Ms. Shirley LaRose, a dedicated public servant who has devoted more than forty-three years of her life to the residents of Northampton, Massachusetts. The city treasurer's office, which has been brightened by her infectious smile and delightful manner, will soon bid farewell to this outstanding woman. She is trading in her balance sheets to enjoy the splendors of a well-deserved retirement. 
It is my understanding that Ms. LaRose began her career in the office of the Northampton city treasurer in 1954 as a clerk. In the years to follow, she was promoted from junior to senior clerk, and then became assistant treasurer. She became treasurer of Northampton in 1972 and has run unopposed for the position in every single election since the primary in 1973. Not only is this stellar record a reflection of her competent handling of the city's financial needs, but also of the respect she earned from the people of Northampton. 
During her years of overseeing the receipt and distribution of city funds as well as the salaries, life insurance, and retirement policies of its employees, I have been told that Ms. LaRose touched the lives of countless people. She served her community with deep integrity, and her contributions to its prosperity are remarkable. I stand today to thank Shirley for her years of service to Northampton and to wish her well in her retirement. Her loyalty and accomplishments will not soon be forgotten by the grateful citizens of Northampton.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, amendment No. 2262, parallels the House-passed resolution passed unanimously this week that Congress set aside money for Black Hawks--$36 million. In last year's foreign operations spending bill the President signed this provision into law. But the money has not been spent. Black Hawks will work better than any alternative in eradicating the poppyseed that grows in Colombia. This poppy is used for heroin, which is becoming increasingly a problem in American cities. 
We have a choice. We can either fight heroin at the source, or we can treat the victims in our own neighborhoods. You do not win a war treating the wounded. Let us get serious in this drug war and pass the amendment. 
I attempted to come to a resolution with the good Senator from Vermont, but we could not reach agreement. Therefore, we will have to vote on the amendment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, my amendment is the middle-class tax relief proposal. It calls on the Government to cut nondefense discretionary spending by 6.9 percent over the next 5 years. It would return discretionary spending to a level of 1996. That does not seem too distant a reach for us. It would produce $200 billion in new tax relief to American workers and it would do it by taking 10 million American taxpayers who, simply because they now make over $25,000 a year, have had their taxes increased from 15 percent to 28 percent. In other words, if they got a single raise, or because of inflation, that has taken these very modest income families and doubled their taxes. 
So we are saying we are going to lift the bar and we are going to allow those families, 10 million of them, to be pushed back down into the 15 percent tax bracket, remembering that American workers today are keeping less than half their paychecks by the time the Government romps through their checking account. No wonder we have so much trouble in our country in terms of families trying to make ends meet. We don't leave them enough resources to do the job we have always asked them to do. This is a major step to correct that problem. I might add--how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. COVERDELL. I might add that one of the functional components of American liberty was and remains the right of workers to have their resources come to them so they can live 
out their dreams and their lives. We have changed this over the years. 
I pointed out this morning, my father kept 80 percent of his lifetime wages, he was born in 1912, and his granddaughter will be lucky if she keeps 40 percent of her lifetime wages. That will functionally change the way this country governs itself and lives. We must restore economic liberty to American workers.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at another time, I had the distinct honor to serve a former President as Director of the U.S. Peace Corps. In that capacity, and due to the time of the watch, I had the opportunity to see the faces of people who had never been free or who had not been free for so long they could not remember it. It was the time when the wall was coming down and barbed wire was being clipped, and we were among the first Americans over the wall and under the wire. 
The faces of those people are forever riveted in my mind. The consciousness of what the lack of freedom does to people has become a study of mine ever since. People's behavior is greatly affected by the condition of their freedom. 
Then, after the Peace Corps, I had the opportunity to come to the U.S. Senate and look at America through the unique window this institution provides. In comparing the two experiences, I came to believe that the genesis of all American glory is that we have been a free people, that everything we are to ourselves and to the world is rooted in the fact that we have been free. 
Mr. President, we hear the words freedom and liberty evoked over and over. I doubt if there is an American alive who doesn't hear it at least four times a day--that we are free people, that we enjoy freedom, that we experience liberty. But I don't think we reflect very much on what that means, what are the dynamics of American liberty. My suspicion is that if you were to ask a student what it constituted, they might likely point to the fact that we have been able to protect ourselves from evil forces throughout our history and keep ourselves free. They would point to Nazi Germany or Saddam Hussein. Or they might say our freedom is constituted in the fact that we are a republic and we are free because we have the right to choose who will represent us in our Government. But that is just a process; that is a means to an end. 
Mr. President, for me, there are at least three core components to American freedom without which we would not be free. I have to say that there has been serious erosion in the last several years--in the last 30 years or so--with regard to each of the three components I choose to believe are core to American liberty. I am asserting that we are not who we are because of our genes; we are who we are because we have been uniquely free, and that freedom has produced the grandest experiment in human behavior in the history of the world. 
What are the three components? Well, first is economic liberty. We fought the War for Independence over the issue of economic liberty. I like to use my family as a case in point. My father was of the generation--a grand generation--that did their part in building America and defended it through two world wars. I don't think anything has ever been asked of a generation more than theirs. But he was born in 1912 and he kept, generationally, 80 percent of all his paychecks. So what happened? Well, the American dream, as we have heard a million times. He began his career as a coal truck driver. Then he sold shoes in a department store. Then he sold Hoover vacuum cleaners and became the youngest city manager for that company in Kansas City. 
And then with those resources he was saving, he opened his own business, and he began to build products and dreams. We have heard it a million times. His granddaughter, my niece, has just begun her business career. Under the current scheme of events, unchanged in her generation, she will keep 40 percent of her paycheck over her lifetime. You don't have to be a rocket scientist here. If her granddad kept 80 percent of his paycheck and she keeps 40 percent, she has exactly half the options and half the capacity to pursue her dreams and to build her career. And I can tell you. 
Mr. President, that will make her think and function differently than her granddad in terms of decisions she makes about her housing, her family, their education, and whom to count on, and whom not to count on, and where to turn for resources. No; it is not in our genes; it is that we have been free. We have over the last several generations been consuming everything we had, and the resources of those yet to come--my niece--so they won't have as much to work with. Any time a contemporary generation is in the business of consuming the resources of generations yet to come, they are in the business of abrogating the freedom of the generations yet to come. 
The second principle of American liberty is safety. Mr. President, that is a little harder to describe. But it is the safety of persons and property. I typically ask people, in their mind, to go someplace that they know is not safe. And what will you see? You will see boarded up buildings, broken windows, decay, and not very many people. Conversely, travel in your mind to a place perceived to be safe, and what will you see? You will see new buildings, you will see new ideas, you will see entrepreneurship, and you will see lots of people, and they will be engaging in commerce and social activities. A free society must be safe--both persons and property. 
Not long ago, I was in Nicaragua at the time of the inauguration of Madam Chamorro, who, in a surprise upset election, threw out the Sandinistas. It was like looking at a still shot. Nothing had moved when that society lost its freedom. When a car ran out of gas, it sat right there. When an axle broke, it sat there. When a building cracked, it broke. 
She and her Government were saying, `Invest in this new free society to help us rebuild.' And everybody's response was virtually the same. When people perceive this to be safe for their investments, safe for their employees and persons that build and work, the investments will come. But until the Government can assure that in a reasonable degree, they won't. We see that replicated over the world time and time again. 
With the Asian crisis, suddenly confidence disappeared and assets moved rapidly away. Why? Not safe. Or any social order that can't resolve differences in a civil manner--every constitution of every State and our Federal Constitution show that government accepts the responsibility for there being a safe society as a principal responsibility. 
The third component of American freedom, or freedom, is an educated mind. An uneducated mind, Mr. President, will be denied the privileges of American citizenship. An uneducated people, Mr. President, will not be free. They cannot be free. 
We have known through our history that we had to produce an educated population to keep America free. The first thing that happens is, the uneducated mind is pushed away from economic opportunity and the inability to provide for oneself. The worst extreme is that they are pushed to a point of the unsavory 
components of our social structure. Then they threaten the second principle of freedom, which is safety. We have all seen the erosion in each of these components. 
Mr. President, I come here as an optimist. I believe this generation of Americans, like those who went before us, will commit themselves to maintaining American liberty and the standards of liberty and to restore those components that have been weakened or crippled. We have passed the first balanced budget in 30 years. We are already benefiting as a people from financial discipline. 
When I first came to the Senate, an average worker in the State of Georgia was keeping 45 cents out of every dollar they earned. Think of it. If Thomas Jefferson were here, he would faint first, and when he awoke, he would scorn us unmercifully that we would have ever allowed this to happen, that an American worker couldn't even keep half of what they produced. At a minimum, they should keep two-thirds of their paycheck--at a minimum. We passed the first tax relief in 16 years. It wasn't near what it should have been, but it was moving in the right direction. Now that Georgia worker is keeping 48 to 49 cents. It ought to be two-thirds. 
I am going to come back to the point. But let me say that I don't believe, on the premise of safety and a safe society, that America will recognize the drug war within 24 months. Eight out of ten prisoners--it doesn't matter, the smallest town jail or the largest city--are there on direct or indirect drug charges. And I don't believe this country will tolerate it. It can't. We cannot accept the fact that 2 million-plus new teenagers are using drugs, or that one in nine in junior high is a regular drug user. That is once a month; or one out of four in our high schools. We are not going to accept this. 
I am convinced it will be turned around. As I said, you will not recognize it in just 24 months. 
With regard to education, we are going to launch a major debate in the Senate on April 20. It will be but one of massive efforts all over this country to reverse the startling data that we receive every week, every month, where only 4 out of 10 students in inner-city schools can pass a basic exam. If we put all the schools together, we get it up to 6 out of 10. That is nothing to brag about. Or one-third of the students or more coming to our universities and colleges cannot read well. 
This is how you get ready for the new century? No. You will not recognize education grades K through 12, kindergarten through high school, in the United States within a decade. It is going to change. America will not accept the status quo. I do not know how all the changes are going to come about, but they are going to happen. 
We have demonstrated that we are beginning to take charge of our watch and keeping the financial integrity--economic freedom--intact so that Americans will continue to do what they have done throughout our history. 
If all we do is protect the economic liberty, the safety of persons and property, and keep our population educated, America will take it from there. Those three components, if we just get them done on a day-to-day basis, we will not have to worry about the next century and America's role in it. It is not all that complicated: keep them free and flexible economically, keep them safe, and keep them educated. 
Now I come to this amendment. I have just said that an American worker is keeping less than half of their paycheck. So this amendment is the middle-class tax relief act. What it does is, it says that over the next 5 years we are going to cut discretionary nondefense spending. We are going to be frugal, and we are going to cut it by 6.9 percent. If we achieve that, what we will have done is we will have said we will return to spending at about the level of 1996. 
Not an onerous task. That will produce about $200 billion over this time in tax relief. It is designed specifically to reduce the middle-class tax squeeze. The way this works is we help 10 million American families who used to be in the lowest tax bracket--15 percent--but once they made 25,000-some few dollars more, they went over the $25,000 income level, wham, the 28 percent tax bracket. We virtually doubled their taxes as they moved from $25,000 to $30,000. What an incredulous policy. 
Again, if you want to know what is culturally affecting America and the American family and the way it functions, it is that. In fact, if you look at the tax burden that those families have borne since 1950 to 1990 and have watched it just skyrocket from 2 cents to 25 cents on the dollar, Federal alone, and then match against it teenage suicide, SAT scores, it all fits. Every time we pushed that burden up and gave them less resources, they were less able to accomplish what the society needs. A lot of people think Hollywood is what has had a profound effect on our culture. Uncle Sam. 
I look at it this way. If something marches through your checking account and takes more than half of what you put in it, it has more to do with you than you do. So we take 10 million of those families and we lift the bar and get them back into the 15 percent tax bracket, which means for the first time in many years they will be keeping over half their paycheck. What a marvelous accomplishment. And they will have new resources to 
do the things we are all complaining about are not happening in America. 
Everybody will benefit, but the middle class will be the principal beneficiaries. Everybody is taxed on that first segment of income, so all taxpayers benefit, but the principal beneficiaries are the ones who we push down into the 15 percent tax bracket. 
In so doing, we will be reinforcing one of the core components of American liberty--economic. Allow workers to work and save and keep resources to do the job that we need to have done in America--take care of their families, make decisions about education, dream new ideas, build new businesses. This is how it comes about. You have to protect the American worker's economic options. This goes a long way towards accomplishing that. 
I am going to share just some of the key components of this. As I said, this middle-class tax relief act returns the middle class to the lowest tax bracket providing broad tax relief. I should note that the cosponsors are Senator McCain of Arizona--Senator McCain will come to the floor here shortly and give his views on this--Senator Nickles of Oklahoma, Senator Helms of North Carolina, and Senator Gramm of Texas, one of our most renowned economists in the Senate. 
The proposal raises the income cap under which the 15 percent individual income tax rate applies. Approximately 10.3 million tax filers will be returned from the 28 percent tax bracket to the 15 percent tax bracket. Married couples' taxable income thresholds would rise to $70,000. Approximately 7.6 million married tax filers would be returned from the 28 percent tax bracket to the 15 percent bracket. Single heads of households' income thresholds would rise to $52,000 for single parents. Approximately 375,000 single heads of households tax filers would be returned from the 28 percent bracket to the 15 percent. Singles' taxable income thresholds would rise to $35,000, and approximately 2.3 million single tax filers would be returned from the 28 percent bracket to the 15 percent bracket. 
Mr. President, 29 million taxpayers would see lower taxes because more income is taxed at 15 percent as a result of this broad-based middle-class tax relief. It is the only major tax relief proposal focused directly on addressing the middle-class squeeze. It is simple, it is basic, and it is achievable in this Congress. 
Mr. President, $39 billion is expected as the annual tax relief from 1999 to 2003, according to preliminary estimates by the Tax Foundation. Nearly $1,200 in average annual tax relief per filer could be expected in the first year alone. It would also provide significant marriage penalty relief without adding complexity to the Tax Code. 
There is not a soul in America who doesn't believe we can't find 6.9 percent in savings. In fact, if you ask the American people, the figure would be a lot higher when they talk about what they consider to be waste or not-accounted-for money, et cetera. It is interesting, on the eve of making this presentation, the Wall Street Journal headline yesterday: `United States Fails To Meet Standard Accounting Methods.'  
Overall, the General Accounting Office--which acted as the equivalent of an outside auditor in preparing the financial statement--[on the American Government] found widespread problems with recordkeeping and documentation that apparently prevented the Government from properly accounting for billions of dollars in property. 
This report is alarming, but it underscores what most of us have known for many, many years, that there is significant waste, significant loss of property and value in this huge, monolithic Federal Government that we have built. It needs to be downsized. We need to return to the idea of empowering the American citizen. We have gone way too far, and we are paying an enormous price for it in flexibility, in responsibility, in the care of our children, in the condition of our schools, in the denial of opportunity. There is no telling, over these last 30 years, because of the students who have come through these schools with inadequate educations, how many ideas, how many Jonas Salks, how many other U.S. Senators, how many new ideas and dreams never happened because we didn't give them the tools that we have traditionally given them in this country, 
We ought to be about that business. We need to restore and protect the economic liberty of the American worker and family. We need to keep them safe, and we need to keep them educated to make it all work. That is what makes American liberty work. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time so the cosponsors might also have an opportunity to come to the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. As everybody knows by now all too well, we have been in the midst of a filibuster going all the way back to last summer on education reform proposals. We have been battling the White House, the minority leadership and the status quo. I am pleased to announce--in fact, I am ecstatic--that the filibuster is over and that a unanimous consent has been entered into, I think a reasonable agreement, that does adhere to our view that all amendments should have been related to education and not extraneous and not broad new tax policy. We will go to our education reform on the day we return from the recess on April 20 of this year. 
Now, the majority leader needs to be commended for the diligence and the attention he gave to try to end this filibuster. I also am complimentary of the minority leader and his attempt to bring this filibuster to an end. But I am especially grateful to the Members on the other side of the aisle, principally my key cosponsor, Senator Torricelli of New Jersey, for the attempts and effort they made--under very difficult circumstances I might add--for an extended period of time to recommend that a filibuster was not the way to handle education reform. 
Because the filibuster has been ended, America's children are going to be the major beneficiaries--and their families. At the end of the day, millions of American families are going to be able to open education savings accounts to help children in public schools, private schools and home schools. Now with the suggestions from the other side of the aisle, we are going to have an opportunity for expanded school construction and 
financing that aids and abets school construction across our Nation. 
After all is said and done, bringing this to a favorable conclusion will lead to a very healthy and wholesome debate about reforming education and moving away from the status quo. Madam President, the winners, those who are going to gain the most from the fact that we have set this filibuster aside, are America's children. They are going to be the beneficiaries of the fact that the Senate has now, on a bipartisan basis, agreed to go to an extended and meaningful debate about reforming education in America, principally grades kindergarten through high school. 
I thank all who have been involved on both sides of the aisle. I think it will prove most beneficial to America and her children. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, as most Members have been aware, the two leaders have been working toward an agreement with respect to the Coverdell A+ education bill going on a week now--13 days, to be exact. The leader regrets to inform the Senate that we will not be able to reach an agreement which would have provided for an orderly procedure to consider the bill, education-related amendments only. 
Therefore, the leader notifies the Senate that the cloture vote will occur at 5:30 p.m. today and the Senate will now resume the bill for debate for 30 minutes equally divided.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this is the fourth filibuster on this proposal. 
When this measure came before the Senate last year, we were told that it was a pretty good idea but it needed to go through the process. It has now been through the Finance Committee. It now embraces many ideas from the other side of the aisle, and, of course, its principal cosponsor is from the other side of the aisle, Senator Torricelli of New Jersey. 
It was reported out with a bipartisan vote 12-8 on February 10, 1998. Provisions have been added to the bill from Senators Moynihan of New York, Graham of Florida, Breaux of Louisiana. Eighty percent of the tax relief embodied in the bill reflects amendments from the other side of the aisle.

Mr. COVERDELL. As I said, we are in our fourth filibuster. The majority leader has now offered five different proposals. I don't think it is necessary to enumerate each of the five different proposals. We have made progress, but every time, there is one more obstacle to getting to the bill and getting to it within the parameters of education debate. 
If this filibuster continues, I just want to point out that about 14 million American families will be denied the opportunity 
to establish savings accounts that will help some 20 million children, that 70 percent of those families will be families that have children in public schools, 30 percent in private. 
To hear some of the opponents, you would think this is a private education savings account. It is far from it. These families would save about $5 billion in the first 5 years and another $5-plus billion in the second 5 years. So we are talking about a lot of money coming to the aid of education without the requirement to raise taxes. No new property taxes, no new Federal taxes. These are families stepping forward to help their children. That will be blocked. Those millions of Americans' opportunity will be stunted. 
If the filibuster continues, the qualified State tuition provision, which would affect some 1 million students gaining an advantage and more provisions when they get to college, 1 million employees will be denied the opportunity to have their employers help them pay for continuing education or fulfilling their educational needs, and 250,000 graduate students will be denied that opportunity as well; $3 billion will disappear from the financing capacity of local school districts to build some 500 new schools across the Nation. 
This is not a very productive filibuster. The American public, particularly those concerned about better education and the need for it, have this roadblock standing in front of them through this filibuster. I compliment both leaders for endeavoring to try to get this accomplished. But I think fairness has been extended. I conclude this statement by saying I think that fairness has been accorded and common sense, as well. I have to conclude we are just still in the midst of a filibuster. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of both leaders. 
But the point is, we are still in a filibuster. When this proposal was in the tax relief bill last year, the President said he would veto the entire tax relief bill if this education savings account was in it. Then we went through one or two filibusters. We tried to deal with it. We had a stand-alone measure last year, and then we had a filibuster attempt. And we tried to proceed to it this year. Now we are trying to bring cloture, which, I might point out, doesn't end the amendments. If you file cloture, it is a Senate rule that says you are going to confine amendments to the subject matter. When I was in the State Senate in Georgia, we had to do that on everything. It was unique that you could amend with nongermane amendments. 
But that is what we are trying to bring order to. And after we have been through four filibusters, a veto threat, we become concerned that we are not in a serious effort to get to the actual education components. 
It is my understanding that we have said the other side can have its own substitute, an education amendment. There has been severe resistance to non-education-related amendments, and I understand an amendment of the Senator from Nebraska is still at play. And it is not an education amendment. It is my understanding that an education amendment on our side is being objected to. We are going to have a vote here in a minute. 
I want to, in closing, stress that this is a bipartisan proposal and one of the most dogged, persistent attempts to get this legislation passed with both Republican and Democrat components. The good Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli --and there are a number of Senators on the other side of the aisle--a good number--who want this legislation passed; 70 percent of it has now been designed by the other side of the aisle. They want to get to the substance of the education debate--the good Senator from Illinois. If we can get to the debate, it is going to have a chance. That is an education proposal. We handle it our way; they handle it their way. We will debate it. But what we are saying is, there ought to be a debate on education. We have spent an inordinate amount of time avoiding the debate. 
Mr. President, I presume my time has expired.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, what we have before us is a resolution that has special standing on the floor. It is a resolution that will take the certification that the President has called for in the case of Mexico's fully cooperating with the United States on the drug war, and this resolution, if it is adopted, would overturn that and it would decertify. That would be a statement that the cooperation had not been full and complete. 
This Senator, the Senator from California and others have been deeply concerned about this matter for well over a year and believe that by saying Mexico should be certified, we are saying to the people of both the United States and Mexico that things are going along OK. It is a message of fulfillment. It is a message that we are making progress, and that is not true. That is not true. 
The situation, by virtually any measurement, is less now than it was a year ago when the Senator from California and I began to raise the issue. 
I am here reluctantly. I consider myself an ally of the people and the Government of Mexico, but we are losing this war, we are losing this struggle, and it is not appropriate to say otherwise. I wish it were possible for us to be here with a resolution that said certification could occur but there would be a waiver by the President for security reasons. That is not technically possible. The only resolution that has standing is this statement, but it must be made. 
Let me say, I commend General McCaffrey for his efforts as our drug czar, and I commend President Zedillo for what appears to be laudable efforts. But we do not do the people of either country, nor the people of this hemisphere, justice by communicating a message of gain or accomplishment or fulfillment when it is the exact reverse. 
My concern--although I am sure it will be interpreted to be pointed at Mexico--my concern is mutual, and it is pointed at this administration and Mexico. 
On May 2, 1997, I and the Senator from California sent an open letter to the President of the United States. We enumerated 10 areas that should become benchmarks, measurements 
by which we can determine whether or not we are getting our arms around this thing that has captured, in the last 5 years, 2 million American children aged 12 to 17. 
On May 14, 1997, the President responded to me and to the Senator from California, accepting the letter of May 2 and the standards that were in it, and he indicated they would report and that these were, indeed, benchmarks that would be sought. 
Mr. President, in this letter, we said: 
The Mexican Government should be able to take significant action against the leading drug trafficking organizations, including arrests and prosecution or extradition of their leaders, and seizure of their assets. 
Virtually no progress. 
Extraditions: 
We said: 
While Mexico has taken steps to allow the extradition of Mexican nationals, they have yet to extradite any Mexican nationals to the United States on a drug-related charge. 
As we stand here tonight, there still has been no extradition of a Mexican national on a drug-related charge. 
Law enforcement cooperation: Mexico should undertake to fully fund and deploy the Binational Border Task Forces. . . 
Not done. 
In addition, U.S. law enforcement officers working drugs in Mexico need to be granted the rights to take appropriate measures to defend themselves. 
Not done. 
Money laundering: We are anxious to see Mexico fully implement the money laundering laws and regulations. . . 
Little progress. 
Corruption: The decision to abolish the National Institute for Combating Drugs and replace it with a new agency known as the Special Prosecutor's Office. . .is an admission that the INCD had become hopelessly compromised. . .We need to see evidence that the new agency will not simply be a retread. . . 
Not done. 
Air and maritime cooperation: This is an area I think both the Senator from California and I concur has made some progress. 
Mr. President, the Senator from California will address this, but she often makes the point that no intelligence is flowing from Mexico to the United States. We are not gaining any advice and counsel on this struggle. 
I am going to yield momentarily. In the New York Times just today--just today--we have an extensive article, the headline of which reads: `U.S. Officials say Mexican Military Aids Drug Trafficking. Study Finds Closer Ties.' 
Some doubt new report, but many say army corruption makes drug war futile. United States analysts have concluded that the case shows much wider military involvement with drug traffickers than the Mexican authorities have acknowledged. 
This report was in the hands of the administration in February of this year, following which the administration decided to certify--following this report. 
I will say it again and again--I hope some of my friends in Mexico hear me out--the fault is mutually shared. Mexico owns considerable responsibility for the failure and the lack of improvement on all of these points, but so does the administration. Let's remember the administration just last year was here trying to repeal this system just for the remainder of its term--`Let's let some other President worry about it'--and more recently has given us a plan to fight the drug war that concludes itself in the year 2007 and for which there are no benchmarks during the remainder of this administration. 
These are not messages of a serious confrontation with a crisis in our country, a crisis in our hemisphere that has the potential of destabilizing every democracy in the hemisphere and poses enormous threats to our ally to the south, the Republic of Mexico. It is time that the Congress, that Members of the Senate say we must be honest, this war is being lost and the costs are beyond description in human life, in property and the stability of the governments of this hemisphere. 
I reluctantly will cast my vote, because of these conditions, for decertification and reality. Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

I might also suggest that the vote is occurring at 7:25 in order to accommodate Senators. There is nothing that would prohibit Senators from continuing to speak on this following the vote. In fact, it is anticipated. I think some of the longer remarks, if you are prepared to speak for 15 minutes, could be made after the vote.

<TEXT>
Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I will respond to the Senator from Minnesota. I appreciate his courtesy, his reflection on my passion for this legislation. I will, at least for his benefit and others, put a slightly different view on the analysis the Senator has presented. 
First, the Senator talked about a cost of $1.6 billion. Now, that is a 10-year period. Of course, it is leaving $1.6 billion in the checking accounts of 14 million American families. But what that fails to acknowledge is that that modest--modest --incentive generates over $10 billion of assets, not tax dollars. These are volunteered assets of American families. So it becomes one of the largest single new sources of financial support for all education in recent times. It is a large, large number. It is not $1.6 billion, but we say, OK, we are not going to tax the interest buildup, so we will receive $1.6 billion less here in Washington. 
They will keep it in savings accounts. That will generate over $10 billion. 
The Senator from Minnesota has not, I believe, acknowledged that this proposal is now a very bipartisan proposal, and it is far more expansive than the savings account which I just described. 
The filibuster that we have been fighting since last July with the Presidential veto threat includes State prepaid tuition plans. It is about the same cost. Again, it is tax relief to families so they are not taxed when they come with prepaid tuition to a college. Twenty-one States now have it. And that was brought to us by Senator Breaux of Louisiana and Senator Graham of Florida. 
The Senator has not acknowledged the employer-provided educational assistance which expands tax exemptions for employers helping their employees continue to improve their education. This leaves almost $2.7 billion of tax relief in these companies' checking accounts. But, of course, it affects over 1 million workers who would be able to have a better education because of it, and 250,000 graduate students, because they would be included for the first time. We owe Senator Moynihan of New York the gratitude for having put this proposal in the package that is being filibustered. 
There are a couple of minor provisions that I will not go into. But the other more significant one that has been brought forward is from Senator Graham of Florida who has devised an expanded financing tool for public school systems which would enable the construction of about 500 new schools. 
So you have a very broad range. You have savings accounts effecting 14 million families and 20 million children generating almost $10 billion of new energy. You have $5 billion in new resources supporting public and private schools; $3 billion in new school construction; 1 million workers receiving tax-free employer-provided education assistance; 1 million students receiving tax relief on State prepaid tuition plans. 
So, A, we have to look at it in a broader context--not just the savings account. And the other is that the vast majority of the proposal now has been proposed by the other side of the aisle. 
The Senator from Minnesota inferred that it is for public education. This is not for public education. That is just not the case. The 500 new schools, public schools, 1 million workers, and 1 million students are all associated with public education. Half of all the proceeds coming out of the savings account, which in the first 5 years is $5 billion, and then, as I said, $10 billion over 10 years--half of it, if you accept the very bare bottom analysis of the Joint Tax Committee, supports students in public schools. That is billions of dollars. And half of it supports children in private or home school. So it is a lot of money. 
The thing that is not clear to anybody right now, and for which we do not have numbers--we can only imagine--is that one of the unique features of the savings account is that a sponsor can be a contributor, a grandparent, an uncle, an aunt, a sister, a neighbor, a church, an employer, a union, a benevolent association--you name it. Those resources coming into the savings account no one has estimated. My judgment is that in the second 5 years it will be equal to what the families are putting in because people's imaginations begin. And it is a limitless opportunity for people to help youngsters have sufficient resources for helping their education, whether it is the requirement to have a tutor, or a home computer, or transportation, or after-school programs, or whatever is perceived to be the problem associated with the child. 
The majority leader has come. The Senator is trying to ask a question. Let us give the majority leader his time.

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the majority leader. I think a better question is, where did it begin? Let us remember that this is the fourth filibuster. This all comes from a proposal that was passed by the Senate with 59 votes--overwhelmingly--and the President of the United States told us he would veto the entire Nation's tax relief if that line stayed in the bill. So that is where we began--the Senate adopting a proposal, the House adopting a proposal, and the administration saying, no way, no deal, no how. It all goes down. So we brought it back as a freestanding proposal. That was filibustered. Then we tried to move to the bill in this sitting of the Congress, and that was filibustered. And we have now had a cloture vote to bring it to an end. We have had three separate suggestions to try to keep it within the realm of germaneness. 
But I think one thing that has not been really talked about here today is that, yes, there is a concern that this is just another filibuster. There is no end to it. If you look at the empirical evidence, everything we have seen is designed not to modify, but to kill or to `poison pill' this thing. You all have used that term very frequently, `poison pill.' We are concerned about that. Now, I don't want to get into debate now. We have both leaders here. 
I will come to the point of my good friend, Senator Dodd, on the $7 and the like. You don't acknowledge the principle that it has gathered up to support public and private education when you try to describe it as the amount of tax relief. What that means is that a person has, on the private side, saved over $1,000, which is a 50 percent increase in the average family savings. On the $7 side, it is a $200 account. It ultimately means that over $2.5 billion in 5 years--$5 billion-plus--is going to public support and private support within 10 years. 
But we will have time to come back to that. I want to honor our two leaders here by trying to iron out how we might proceed.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, earlier this afternoon, the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Connecticut were debating their opposition to the education savings account that we have been struggling with since last July. The essence of their argument is that it does not amount to much, that there would only be $37 of interest saved on a family that had a child in private school and only $7 if the family had a child in public school. 
You cannot have it both ways. If it is so insignificant, why have we spent the better part of a year filibustering it? Why would the President say, `I will veto the entire tax relief package if that provision is in there'? Something about that argument does not fit. 
The other thing I will say about those arguments is that they talk about the tax--that figure is a tax that wouldn't have been paid by that family--but they forget to mention the amount of principal that is in the account earning interest which is forgiven. In the case of $37, that means that family has saved over $1,000 in order to earn the $37 tax relief. What it says to me is how little incentive it takes to make Americans go out and save. 
Madam President, $1,000 is 50 percent greater than the average savings of American families. The average American family today saves $1,900. That is their savings. And by this modest forgiveness, we take it up to $3,000. So we are using a very modest amount of tax relief to cause Americans to save billions of dollars. This tax relief proposal would generate in the first 5 years $5 billion worth of savings and over a 10-year period over $10 billion worth of savings to aid and support students in public and private education. 
The third point I will make is this: The other side and the White House celebrated extensively the passage of a $500 education savings account, one-fourth the size of this savings account, and that was, as I said, celebrated on the White House lawn: `This is a great idea.' Well, if $500 worth of the ability to save is such a great idea, how come if we expand it up to $2,000 it is suddenly an insignificant idea? 
That becomes a little hard to follow, too. 
You know, again, I go back, Madam President. The President of the United States said, `I will veto the entire tax relief to every American citizen in the United States if that savings account for American families stays in the tax relief bill.' So we had to take it out. We are not going to have every American family denied tax relief over this idea. We think it is a good idea, but we were not going to do that. So we brought it back as freestanding legislation and, as we have said here this afternoon, have been filibustered every step of the way. 
The other point I would like to make to my colleague from Massachusetts and my colleague from Connecticut, who has left the floor, is that this proposal is now a much larger proposal. And the proposal represents the input of Senator Breaux of Louisiana, Senator Graham of Florida, and Senator Moynihan of New York. In other words, we have made this a very broad-based, broad policy, with representatives from both sides of the aisle. This is no longer a Republican proposal; this is a Senate proposal. The chief cosponsor of this legislation is Senator Torricelli of New Jersey. He sits over there--principal cosponsor. 
By listening to this thrashing back and forth this afternoon, you would think this were a gold-gilded Republican, highly partisan proposition. The proposal on the floor--if we can ever get to it--the amount of tax relief we represented, 80 percent of it comes from the Democrats' ideas. They are good ideas. State prepaid tuition plans; they are not going to tax students when they get the money to go to college; or expanding employer-provided educational assistance. 
I yield for just a moment. I say to the Senator from 
Alaska, if he wants to call back his time, I will be glad to facilitate his needs.

Expanded employer-provided educational assistance. That is a tax relief to employers who help their employees expand their education. And the Joint Tax Committee says 1 million American workers will benefit from that. 
Senator Graham from Florida has a school construction provision which makes financing to build public schools expanded and will lead to 500 new schools across the Nation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post, and I am sure papers across the country and the electronic media outlets, were reporting on the President's assertion that our side of the aisle has somehow shortchanged education. 
I find this to be exceedingly ironic as I stand here in the midst of the fourth filibuster over the last several months orchestrated by the President and his administration to block massive education proposals that vast majorities of the American people support. 
We weathered a filibuster to get to the bill. Now, we have made offers to the other side so that they can bring their package for an open debate. They do not want to do that. Then we said, well, let us try to bring order to the process and have the amendments pertain strictly to the education issue. They rejected that. 
So basically you have a strategy, through two events, to not allow us to end the filibuster or to just go from amendment to amendment, many of which have nothing to do whatsoever with education. 
So on the front page we have the President saying that our side of the aisle is not stepping forward on education, but in the Halls of Congress and here where we are doing the people's business, he is orchestrating a filibuster. And it is the fourth or fifth one on education proposals. 
People might rightly ask, well, what is the cost of this filibuster? What happens if the President is successful in blocking these education proposals? 
Well, first and foremost, 14 million American families with children in school--most of which are in public schools, many of which are in private or home schools--will be denied if this filibuster continues. If we cannot end it, 14 million American families with children in school who would be given an education savings account as a tool to help them deal with their children's needs will be blocked dead. 
There will be no account, which means that these American families will be denied an opportunity to save upwards to $10 billion-plus over the next 8 years. So billions of dollars that would come to the support of children in classrooms all across the country, which everybody acknowledges is a problem, will never appear, not a dime. Those savings will not occur, and that support will not occur. 
So some 20 million children will miss this opportunity to be helped to get a home computer, to be helped to get a tutor, a special-education requirement, after-school transportation, a school band uniform, you name it. All of those things that those billions of dollars would buy are not going to happen if this filibuster continues. 
Everybody has read week in and week out a report about the problems we are having in grades kindergarten through high school. And everybody is reading about how difficult it is to pay for college. `So let us filibuster an attempt to bring all these resources together and deny the American people the opportunity to do it.' 
If the filibuster succeeds, one million students who will benefit from tax relief on State prepaid tuition plans--State prepaid tuition plans are plans where families can buy their 
child's college tuition in advance. States led the way almost a decade ago in this idea to help families, to guarantee education at quality State universities. 
One million students who are in these plans, when they draw the money out, will be taxed on it if the filibuster continues. Twenty-one States have these plans: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. 
Seventeen more States are putting these plans in place: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Rhode Island. 
This movement to help States, help their students get good quality university educations in these quality university systems--it will not happen. And it will slow down the States that do it. And those that do have these plans and the student gets the money, they are going to be taxed, so they will have less resources. 
One million workers in America, including 250,000 graduate students, would benefit from tax-free employer-provided education assistance. In other words, an employer in America could pay up to $5,250 for one of their employees to advance their education or to upscale it or to improve it. And the money would go to the employee without being taxed as if it were income, which is what happens now. That isn't going to happen if the filibuster continues. These one million workers and these 250,000 graduates will just be in tough luck. The money is not going to come to them. If it does, it is taxed. 
I think, given the President's comments, this last point is very salient. If the filibuster continues, $3 billion in new tax-exempt private activity bonds, which would build schools all across our land--and if I have heard that once, I have heard it a thousand times here: we need to be concerned about building new schools, and there are dilapidated schools. The Senator from North Dakota was talking about it yesterday. Well, with the guidance of Senator Graham of Florida, this provision that is being filibustered would make available $3 billion--$3 billion--in new construction possibilities across the land. And 186 school districts all across the country that are crunched by rapid growth would be denied a supplemental activity to build these schools for these fast-growing communities. 
Fourteen million families, 20 million children, 1 million students in college State prepaid tuition plans, 21 States, 17 new States, 1 million workers, 250,000 graduate students, and $3 billion for new schools--none of it will happen, zero--zero, a flat straight line. And it will rest at the feet of the President of the United States. He has consciously tried to block this provision for well over a year. 
Now, the obvious question is, why? Why would anybody stand in the way of 14 million families, 20 million students, these 21 States, 1 million workers? What in the world would anybody do that for? This is it. No matter what is said, how much smoke and mirrors we have around it, it is because he is wedded to the status quo and the National Education Association does not want this to happen. Kind of hard to believe. You would think that an organization dedicated to education would want all these millions of families to take advantage of it. 
But here is the point. We really ought to call it a pinhead or a sliver the width of a hair, the fact that some families, some of these 14 million families, which have to be statistically insignificant, but some of them will take the money they have put in the account--remember, everybody, it is their money. This is not tax money; this is their money that they put in the savings account to help their children. It has been voluntary. We have not had to raise taxes a dime to do any of these things. We have just encouraged Americans to do it for themselves. 
Several thousand of them will take the money in the savings account and will pay tuition for their child to go to a different school. For that reason, we are in the fourth or fifth filibuster and we are going to stop all of these things. We are going to stop savings, we are going to stop the tax relief, we are going to hinder the State setting up the State tuition plans, we are going to stop the million workers, we are going to stop the $3 billion in school construction, because a handful of families might use their own money to make a decision for a child to go from a public school to a private school. 
I just have to say on the ledger of events, that is insane. It is utterly incredible, an egregious burden to put on an attempt to help so many and so easily. I have been surprised at how little an incentive is required to cause Americans to save. It is staggering. These billions of dollars that would go into the savings account are going in there because they will save taxes on the interest buildup. So, over the next 5 years, we will leave $750 million--less than $1 billion--in these savings accounts. We won't tax that. That will cause 14 million families to open an account and to save over $5 billion. There are not many things we can do around this town that leverage themselves that well. That is 15 to 1. I wish we could do this all day long. 
These education savings accounts, 70 percent of the families who use them will have children in public schools, 30 percent will have children in private or home schools. The Joint Tax Committee says that the money will probably be about evenly divided, $2.5 billion supporting students in public, $2.5 billion supporting students in private. That is probably initially the case, because it costs more to go to a private school and those families will probably save more; they will try harder, because they are paying for public education through their property tax base and the private school has to be put on top of it. So they probably will save a little more initially. 
The one thing that the Joint Tax Committee has not evaluated as yet, and in my closing minutes here I want to talk about, is that probably more important than the money is that every time a family opens a savings account, there is a switch that goes on. That family suddenly has a financial instrument that is dedicated to their child's education, and from that point forward every time they get that slip that tells them how much is in the account, they are going to be thinking about how they will use that account and what problem is their child having that needs attention. 
I know this personally because years and years ago my father and I opened a savings account for two sets of twins. To this day, we still get a slip from the savings and loan association that tells us how much is left in it and how much it built up. It was all used for education. If this had been the case, my dad and I would have had twice the money that we ultimately saved. From that point on, we were reminded over and over and over about that situation because of that account. Clearly, it adds a new focus. It is like a massive PTA, so to speak. 
Now, the other feature that is equally important is that, unlike any other savings account of this type, sponsors can contribute to the child's savings. Not just the family, but when grandmother comes to the birthday, instead of a gift that is tossed away as old 24 hours later, she can contribute to the savings account, which will last a lifetime. And they will, and so will uncles and aunts, even neighbors. 
Every time I talk about these savings accounts, corporations, you can see the wheels start to turn, because they are saying to themselves, `I could watch my employees, and we can both contribute to those savings accounts. This would be a good thing for our company to do.' Or labor unions or churches, benevolent associations--it is limitless, the imagination of the American people. We have read about these philanthropists using scholarships to help elementary schools: `We will give them a new school.' These philanthropists will be able to open these savings accounts early on and assure a quality college education. The ideas that will come around these savings accounts, in that they allow sponsors, have yet to be fully thought of, because Americans are so ingenious. 
And none of the value of those sponsors is in any of the financial estimates. It will be billions, billions in dollars, creating one of the largest new--all of this is new money, not redirected; this is volunteered money, coming forward from a family's own checking accounts--no property taxes having to be raised, no taxes having to be raised at the Federal level. These are folks coming forward on their own, so it is all new. And it is smart money. It is smart money because it is directed right at the child's need. Public dollars have a hard time doing that. 
Public dollars have a hard time finding that tutor for the math-deficient student, but the parents know what the problem is, or should, and hopefully this will help them think about it. They can put the money right on target. The child has dyslexia. Then we have a special education tutor. The child can't get to the after-school programs. We can arrange for that to happen 
through these accounts. Eighty-five percent of inner-city children in America today do not have a home computer. As my good colleague Senator Torricelli often says, how could anyone even envision coming to the new century without a home computer? Forty percent of the students in general don't have home computers, but it is 85 percent in inner-city schools. 
It has been interesting to me to watch leaders in inner-city communities say, `We want these savings accounts.' The sacrifices they are having to make and the problems they are having to face, all of these things help them, in particular. I might add, because every now and then I hear from the other side, `This just goes to the wealthy,' 75 percent of all these resources go to families earning $75,000 or less--or less. I might also add that the criteria for who can use the account are identical to the little college savings account that the President signed last year. 
Again, Mr. President, the hour draws near. It is duplicitous and cynical, when you are orchestrating a filibuster that denies millions of American families an advantage in education, to go out on the stage and point the finger at our side of the aisle and say we are not doing anything for education. No wonder this town reeks with cynicism. No wonder. I am trying, I say to the chaplain, to be conscious of the prayer, which was beautiful. But that is cynical. 
I cannot think of a single loser in this legislation, not one; everybody is a winner. That doesn't happen around here very often. Usually on tax policy and the like, somebody is a winner at the expense of somebody else. Any child in America, no matter where they go to school, no matter the family circumstances, they have a chance to create a new tool to help deal with the educational needs of their children. 
And it helps confront the high costs of college in two ways. Savings accounts could be kept until college. We protect the tax relief tuition plans in 21 States, with 17 States coming behind it, 1 million workers getting back into education, 250,000 graduate students, $3 billion in new school construction--$3 billion. And there is not a single loser. We would throw it all away, throw it all out, because some few families would use their savings account, which is their money, to pay tuition in another school. That is incredible and disappointing and cynical and denying of real benefits to the people of our Nation suffering a massive, massive problem. 
Let me conclude by saying this: This has been a very strong bipartisan effort. My cosponsor is Senator Robert Torricelli from New Jersey, from the other side of the aisle. He had been tireless in his effort to make the same case, many times much more adroitly than I. Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, Senator Breaux of Louisiana, Senator Graham of Florida who designed many of these provisions, Senator Moynihan who designed some of the provisions of this proposal. As a matter of fact, almost 80 percent of the costs associated with the bill are on provisions associated with the other side of the aisle. I thank those Members very much for their assistance. I hope they will continue to be attentive to the dynamics of what is happening here. 
The suggestion being made by the other side of the aisle that there has not been a fair balance on debate does not hold water. We are trying to keep the debate focused on education and not extraneous matters. I think that is appropriate. We are not trying to turn this into a Christmas tree. We are trying to talk about education, an education proposal. I hope we will be successful in cutting off this fourth debate later this afternoon. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I know the minority leader will appreciate concerns on our side in the midst of the fourth filibuster over this. We already had to fight and break filibuster just to get to this point. The entire exercise on this legislation has related to one filibuster after the other, so obviously it has raised concerns that the amendment process will be used as another extension of the filibuster. I think that is a fair concern on our side. 
I have to say to the minority leader that even on your side I have heard numerous expressions that there should be a discipline about the education proposal and the debate should be about education, not broad tax policy. I have a tax relief bill that pushes millions of people into the 15 percent tax bracket. I have not introduced it here and won't. I don't think it should be. I think it should be an education debate. 
Now, the 9 Democrat amendments that have been offered that the leader is referring to, of the 14, 3 are tax, 6 are nontax, but they are all education related, which I think is appropriate. I do think there has to be some order. I think I even heard in some nature that context referred to by the Senator from Delaware, Minnesota and others on your side. There ought to be some discipline. 
I also say that while it is technically a tax bill, it is a minimalist tax bill. It is a large vehicle, a large vehicle. 
I think that there has been an extended effort to try to come to a meaningful balance between your side and our side on this measure. I pointed out yesterday that the legislation in our package was 80 percent designed by your side of the aisle--Senator Graham of Florida, Senator Breaux of Louisiana, Senator Moynihan of New York and others. In the process of framing this, we tried to take the admonishment you gave last year, which was we wanted to go through the process, the Finance Committee. We have done that, heard from both sides. There is heavy influence from both sides. We are simply trying to find a way to get out of the filibuster, to get out of the fourth filibuster, and get down to a discussion about our different views on education. 
I hope this last offer or suggestion that has been outlined, that you are hearing for the first time, might be the genesis of coming to an agreement of how we can move on, in both of our mutual interests, on making the Federal Government a good partner in facing the calamity that we have all talked about over the last couple of years in kindergarten and through high school and the costs of higher education. 
I did want to make those points.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe we must be reading from different scripts on this legislation. This is the sixth day of the filibuster from the other side and, if successful, it will keep 14 million families from opening a savings account; it will keep $2.5 billion from supporting students in public schools over the next 4 years; it will keep $2.5 billion from supporting children in private and home schools over the next 4 years; it will stop 1 million students who would benefit from tax relief on State prepaid tuition, and 17 others to consider it; it will block 1 million workers, including 250,000 graduate students, from benefits from their employers for advanced education or continuing education; it will block $3 billion in new tax-exempt, private activity bonds, which will stop dead the construction of 500 schools. That is what the filibuster will block. 
I find it strikingly similar to the debate in opposition and the suggestion from the National Education Association and Mary Teasley, who says these tax-free savings accounts disproportionately benefit wealthy families who already send their children to private and religious schools. Bunk. 
Seventy percent of the families that will use these accounts have children in public schools. And my view is that Ms. Teasley is probably doing reasonably well. 
This is a letter from a very fine lady named Louise R. Watley, chairperson of the City Wide Advisory Council on Public Housing in Atlanta. She has been a resident of the Carver Homes Public Housing Community since 1955. She says: 
I have witnessed generations of young African Americans grow up in one of our nation's poorest neighborhoods. In the 1980s, I fought the epidemic of crack cocaine among our youth by working to kick drug dealers out of our community. In the 1990s, I find myself fighting the epidemic of hopelessness that has resulted from the increasing failure of our public schools to educate poor, urban children. As the Chairperson of the City Wide Advisory Council on Public Housing, and on behalf of the thousands of Atlanta public housing residents the Council represents, I ask you to provide us with hope for improving the K-12 education of our children. 
. . . Please support the passage of the A+ Accounts for Public and Private Schools Act as well as stronger Federal charter school legislation and demonstration public and private school choice projects. Please allow the poorest children in Atlanta and Georgia to escape ineffective and unsafe schools. 
Mr. President, I have a feeling that this woman has a little more personal experience than this lady defending the status quo who works for the NEA.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the majority and minority leader for efforts to bring to resolution the ability to deal with this education proposal. I do want to make one comment for which there was not sufficient time in the 15 minutes allotted to each. Mr. President, in the final minutes of the last half-hour allotted to our debate before the vote, once again I heard the suggestion that the amount of tax benefit that would accrue to these 14 million American families that the Joint Tax Committee feel would take advantage of these education savings accounts is minimal and insignificant. Of course, I find it ironic that we would be operating under Presidential veto threats and five filibusters for something perceived to be so insignificant. 
What these arguments fail to measure is the other information from the Joint Tax Committee. One says 14 million families will use this; 70 percent of them will be families with children in public schools; and in the first 4 years, these families with, I admit, just a little tax incentive, will save voluntarily about $5 billion. In over 8 years it will exceed $10 billion. That is not insignificant. That is putting billions of all new money behind improving education in America. 
The Joint Tax Committee says about half of that will go to students in public schools and half in private. That may be. They have not evaluated the fact that sponsors, churches, corporations, friends, neighbors, and grandparents can also contribute to the account. The value of that has yet to be interpreted. 
The other argument was that this account tends to benefit the wealthy. The Joint Tax Committee says 70 percent of it goes to families of $75,000 or less. But I think you have to step back and understand that the governance of these accounts--who can use them, which is pushing towards middle income and lower--is identical, I repeat, identical to the formula that was adopted by the other side and signed by the President for savings accounts for higher education. There is no difference. 
So, I find it ironic that we would be arguing about this benefiting someone who they do not think should receive the benefit when it was just fine and dandy when it was signed on the White House lawn last fall. It is the same. 
I guess the piece that is forgotten in this debate over how much is saved is they only focus on the interest saved, which is marginal. But they forget that it is the interest on a big piece of principal, and that for most families who open this savings account, the net effect of their savings will be 50 to 100 percent greater than the average family is saving in America today. 
If nothing else was done at all, isn't it a good idea to cause Americans to save billions of dollars? But, in fact, it won't be just saved. This money is going to go to help children. 
So far, this filibuster--and I will stop with this, Mr. President--this filibuster would keep 14 million families from opening a savings account; 20 million children from benefiting from it; in the first 4 years, $2.5 billion going behind kids in public schools; $2.5 billion going behind kids in private schools; 1 million workers who will receive benefit from their companies to extend their education; 1 million students who would have a tax advantage who bought prepaid tuition in 21 States; 250,000 graduate students who would now become eligible for employer-paid continuing education; and 500 schools won't be built because it makes new financing available for school districts across the whole land to build schools, and we are filibustering that kind of growth. 
I am very hopeful that the work of the two leaders over the weekend will untie this knot and we can get on to being a good partner for families with children in schools in America. We sure need to do it. I yield the floor. 
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business, to accommodate a number of Members who have requested time to speak, until 11:30 a.m. 
Under a previous agreement, at 11:30 a.m., the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the NATO expansion treaty. All Senators with amendments to the resolution of ratification are encouraged to contact the managers of the treaty with their amendments with the hope of making considerable progress on the treaty during today's session. 
Also, as under a previous consent, at 4:45 p.m., the Senate will begin 30 minutes of debate relative to H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education bill, prior to the previously scheduled 5:15 p.m. cloture vote on the bill. As a reminder to all Members, first-degree amendments to H.R. 2646 must be filed by 1 p.m. today and second-degree amendments must be filed by 4:15 p.m. 
In addition, the Senate may consider any other legislative or executive business cleared for Senate action. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that the next 30 minutes are under my control or my designee's.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, if I might respond, at the appropriate time we will have Senator Graham of Florida, who has been integral to the negotiations, respond to the Senator's questions. But currently, public schools can use tax-exempt bonds for construction. 
I believe that I can conceptually characterize Senator Graham's interest in that he wanted to add to the category or the function that allows funding for airports where you could have a private company do the construction for the public system for the public good and lease the facility to the public school district after a certain period of time, which would follow into ownership. Senator Graham's objective was to create an extended ability for public school systems to have financing for the construction of their schools. 
So he is basically expanding the capacity for public school districts to fund construction of the new schools. The construct of the amendment caps that facility because of the sums of money that are available, and it also has the facility to aid and abet large growth districts.

Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will yield, I believe the majority leader has properly characterized what the discussions have been between both leaders. The majority leader has said the other side can offer its package, which could include Senator Moseley-Braun's, or not, or we could agree on a set number of amendments for each side, so long as they are germane to education, which, of course, should embrace the Senator's idea as well. 
So there are at least two separate suggestions being discussed between leaders that would facilitate the opportunity of the Senator from Illinois to bring her proposal into the debate.

Mr. COVERDELL. I say to the Senator, just for clarification--I know you 
are concerned; I understand it--but I do want to make it clear that at this point the difference relates to an order and an orderly procedure. 
The majority leader has offered to the minority leader the suggestion that the other side offer its package to stand against the one that has come through the Finance Committee. There are already another four proposals in the Finance Committee offered, three of which are from colleagues on your side of the aisle: Senator Moynihan of New York, Senator Breaux of Louisiana, and Senator Graham of Florida. 
So there were still other issues on the other side. So the suggestion was, well, you put your package together, which could include the proposal you just mentioned, or any others, and we will let the two stand against each other. That was not accepted. 
The second suggestion was that we arrive at a certain number of amendments on each side and that they be germane. As I understand it, that has not been accepted so far. But the proposal you just mentioned, there was not an attempt to keep that from being in debate. There is an attempt to keep the debate on education matters and not others. It is a tax bill; everybody understands that. It invites a lot of attention. But there is an attempt to keep it on the focus of education. I just wanted to make that comment. 
Several Senators have mentioned the proposal from the Senator from Illinois. I don't think there has been an attempt to block that from being in the debate. It did not succeed in the Finance Committee; another school construction program from your side, Senator Graham's, has. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I do want to point out with regard to the remarks made by the good Senator from Massachusetts, that what we are debating here theoretically is not even the merits of the legislation. The other side is filibustering. This is an outrageous filibuster that is designed to prohibit us from ever getting to the legislation. The other side has organized. The motion being debated is the motion made by the majority leader to bring the bill to the floor, and the other side is filibustering that. The comments that the Senator from Massachusetts made about their version and wanting to have an opportunity to discuss it and debate it is blocked, not by us, but by their filibuster. In fact, in the original unanimous consent request, the majority leader offered the other side an opportunity to bring their version to the floor as a substitute or as an amendment and we would have a full and open debate about the merits of these proposals. So it is important that everybody understand. This is a little bit disingenuous because the other side is trying to keep us from even getting to the legislation. It is the ultimate example of defense of the status quo. 
The Senator from Massachusetts took issue with the status quo. But we cannot deal with the status quo, or improve it--whether it is their version or ours--if they will continue to disallow our ability to bring the legislation to the floor. 
The Senator referred to one component of our proposal, an education savings account, for which any family is eligible, that somehow in their mind, or in his mind, was not attentive enough to the poor. I want to point out to the Senator and to the other side that the criterion by which our savings account is created is identical. I repeat: It is identical to the savings account that the President signed, with a great celebration and fanfare at the White House a year ago, or last fall, for a savings account for just higher education. 
That savings account allowed a family to save $500 a year, just as ours, and it works identically to our account. So the criteria that was designed for the savings account that was signed into law last year is designed to push the vast resources of these savings accounts to people of middle income and lower. 
Seventy percent of all the proceeds in all these savings accounts will go to families earning $75,000 or less. But the important point is that the governance rules of these savings accounts are the exact same rules that the other side embraced last fall in the tax relief proposal and that the President signed. There is no difference. That proposal was designed to make the account work toward middle class; this one is designed to accomplish the very same thing. So it is a smoke-screen issue to suggest that somehow the governance of this education savings account favors people of substantive means when the other one didn't and when they are identical, absolutely identical. 
The only thing that is changed is that we have said that instead of $500 a year, you can save up to $2,000, and instead of it just applying to college needs, it should be eligible for kindergarten through high school. It seems pretty logical to just expand the usage of it. I will come back to what I consider deflecting arguments from what the real problem is on the other side a little bit later. 
I yield up to 10 minutes to my good colleague from Tennessee.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Tennessee. I think in a very brief period, he has demonstrated what all of us are so worried about; that we have been making greater and greater investments financially, particularly in grades kindergarten through high school, and we are not seeing the kind of results from it we need to see. 
We have all known that you have to have an educated society to maintain a free country. 
On a personal basis, all those numbers on all of those charts of the Senator from Tennessee--which I would like a copy of--at the end of the tunnel what they point to, in all too many cases, is that a child can get out of our school system and not be ready to take care of themselves in society. They will have trouble getting a job, they will have trouble thinking through the kind of problems they have to solve, and they will be a diminished citizen. They are not going to be able to enjoy the opportunities and privileges that go with American citizenship. That is what all those numbers mean at the end. Thousands of people across our country are denied the benefits of American citizenship because they don't have the tools to engage our society. 
I think I will take a moment, if I may, Mr. President, to remind everybody that we are in the midst of a debate over whether or not the other side will allow us to bring our proposal for improving families and their children's education, for improving education and grades kindergarten through high school and beyond. We are trying to get our proposal to the floor. That proposal is being filibustered on the other side. We are going to have a vote at 12:15 today to see if we can get 60 Senators who will agree that we need to get this legislation to the floor. 
Let me take a moment, if I might, Mr. President, and describe the legislation that we want to bring to the floor today. The first provision is an education savings account. This is the provision that has caused the most discussion. Currently, last year in the Tax Relief Act, we adopted an education savings account. It was for $500. In other words, $500 per year can be put in the savings account and the interest buildup will be tax free if the proceeds are used for college expenses. It was designed by means testing to assure that the principal benefits went to middle income or lower. 
Our proposal is to take the savings account that was passed overwhelmingly, that was signed by the President, and say you can invest more than $500; you can save up to $2,000 per year. So we have increased it by $1,500. Then we said, Why limit it to just financial needs that confront a family with a student in college? Why not make it possible for the family to use that savings account at any period in their education--kindergarten through college? And we applied the same constraints to that account. Everything about it is the same. So it is a pretty simple proposition. We took the savings account, you can put more in it, and you can use it kindergarten through college. 
Interestingly enough, the amount of money that we will be leaving in family checking accounts through this instrument is not a lot of money in terms of a $1.6 trillion budget. It is about $750 million that would be left in these checking accounts over 5 years. What is interesting is, that small amount of relief, according to the Joint Tax Committee, multiplies itself by about 15 times--that families across the country, somewhere between 10 million and 14 million, who will use this opportunity, who will open this account, will save in the first 4 years about $5 billion. In over 8 years, they will save between $10 and $12 billion. So we are taking a very small amount of tax relief incentive and it causes American families to do something we all think they should do--save. And they are going to save billions of dollars. 
What can they use the accounts for? They can use them for any educational need. I call these billions of dollars `smart dollars' because the guidance system is right in the household; it is the parent, who understands most what the child's needs are. They may decide this child has a math deficiency, so they would use the account to hire a tutor. Or they may be one of the 85 percent of the families in the inner city who don't have a home computer; they would use the account to help that child's education by acquiring a home computer. They may have a physical impairment or a special 
education need, and they could use the account to hire a special ed teacher to deal with whatever the problem would be. 
There are no losers in this proposition. A lot of legislative proposals we see here, somebody gains and somebody loses. Not in the education savings account. Whether the child is in a rural school, an urban school, a fairly wealthy school district, or a very poor school district, everybody benefits. Whether the child is in public education, where 70 percent of the families who use these accounts will be supporting children in public schools, or 30 percent will be supporting children that are in private schools or home schools, there is no component of education that will not be the beneficiary of the savings account. 
A little earlier, the Senator from Massachusetts was admonishing the fact that the Joint Tax Committee says about half the money that parents use--remember, it is their money--that these billions of dollars that are being saved are private dollars; they are not tax dollars. About half of that will go to support students in private schools, and about half will go to support children in public schools. I guess the Senator takes exception to that. 
What that means at the end of the day is, in the first 4 years, $2.5 billion will be out there supporting children in private schools and about $2.5 billion will be out there supporting children in public schools. It will be families, but there will be a tendency to save a little less, because a family in a public school does not have to deal with tuition. I assume the Joint Tax Committee is acknowledging that families with children in private schools have bigger bills to pay because they have to pay the public school costs through their property tax, and they have to add the private school on top of it, so they will probably save a little more and they will spend it sooner. 
The thing that the Joint Tax Committee does not do is estimate what happens if the families kept it through college. They have only estimated the division of money kindergarten through high school, and they also have not calculated a huge benefit that this savings account creates because it allows sponsors to contribute to the account. This makes it unique. What do you mean, `sponsors?' Well, an employer could help his or her employees by depositing funds in the employee's savings account for education. A church could. A grandparent could give a child a deposit in a savings account instead of a toy that will probably be ignored in 24 hours. This might change birthdays dramatically as parents, friends, uncles, and aunts try to figure out what kind of gift and find that a deposit in that child's savings account would be a great gift and have a lasting beneficial effect. That hasn't been indicated in the Joint Tax Committee's work. It will alter dramatically what the final outcome is of the distribution. 
Say it all ended up exactly where they said. Why would anybody oppose infusing billions of new dollars behind children in private schools and billions of new dollars behind children in public schools? Why in the world would that be a reason to be upset about? It is mind boggling that a savings account that families open with their own money--not public money, their own money--from which some 10 to 14 million families will benefit, some 20 million children, and we would have this strident filibuster in opposition to it. Pretty mind boggling. 
There are other provisions of the proposal. I will go over them briefly. It helps qualified State tuition provisions. In a number of States--21 of them, to be specific--States allow parents to purchase a contract that locks in their tuition costs for college in the future at today's prices. This proposal would allow those proceeds to come out tax free to the student. Twenty-one States would be immediate beneficiaries, or the citizens of those States. In fact, this is one of the most costly provisions of the proposal. There are other States that currently are considering this provision, but this would help parents and States who are trying to help parents set up these advance tuition payment systems. 
The proposal would aid employer-provided educational assistance. This legislation extends the exclusion for employers who pay their employees' tuition through 2002 and expands it to include graduate students, beginning in 1998. This allows employers who pay up to $5,250 per year for educational expenses to benefit their employees, without the employee having to claim it as income and pay taxes on it. So every company across our land has an incentive to help their employees update and improve their education--once again, a very sound proposal that has a broad reach across our country. 
Briefly, there are two other major provisions that deal with helping small school districts get revenue bonds to help build schools, and there is some defining language that helps make HEALTHY, the national health care scholarships--these five provisions are at the center of our proposal that we are trying to get to the floor for a debate. 
I want to reiterate, relating to the comment from the Senator from Massachusetts, we have been agreeable to the other side bringing to the floor their provision and debating it. What we are trying to do is get the legislation on the floor. We have been joined by my cosponsor on the other side of the aisle, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, who has been tireless in his effort to promote particularly the education savings account among the adversaries on the other side. I have been particularly appreciative of his work and courage in helping us with this educational innovation. He has been tireless. His intellect has been superior. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge one of the most eloquent statements we have heard about education savings accounts that has just been given to us by Senator Torricelli. I particularly applaud his reflection on the caste system that we are in danger of creating in this country. It has been rewarding to me, and I know to the Senator from New Jersey, that many of the leaders of these communities, from Alveda King to Congressman Flake, really want these savings accounts because they understand it could be a potential avenue and tool to alleviate that caste system. I appreciate those remarks.

Mr. COVERDELL. First of all, I thank the Senator from Maine for her courtesy and her remarks. But specifically to her question, the answer in both cases is no. Absolutely not. No local public school dollars are diverted. As a matter of fact, as the Senator knows, if a family today anywhere in America makes a decision to go to a private school, that is over and above the fact that they continue to pay their property taxes and their school taxes for the public education system. All of these dollars are private dollars.

Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Maine is correct. In fact, my assertion is that public school children attending public schools would be the principal beneficiaries. Seventy percent, according to the Joint Tax Committee, of families--that is about, incidentally, 7 to 10 million of them--will be families with children in public schools, and about 30 percent will be families with children in private schools. The division of the money is more equal. It is about 50-50, according to the latest results. But those are not complete, because they only apply to kindergarten through high school, and not through college. But, specifically, families with children in public schools can use them, and, in fact, more families with children in public schools will use these accounts.

Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator is absolutely correct; it is eligible for use. My interest has been kindergarten through high school, as the Senator knows, but the family can make its own choice. The accounts can be used from kindergarten through college, and post college, if the student is suffering from a disability and has an ongoing educational requirement. So it is a full life of education as we know it in America.

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Maine. Again, I appreciate the courtesy extended to those of us who have been framing the legislation. I understand her interest in clarifying these points, because there has been considerable misinformation. I will not go into it at this point. But it is disappointing, considering the source. These are sources involved with education, and you would think there would be a particular integrity, that I have found absent, and I am disappointed about it. 
I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his support and comments on our education proposal. I appreciate it very much. 
Mr. President, I thought in closing out this debate over whether or not we can get to this legislation, or whether we will continue to be filibustered, that it would be pretty interesting to compare two approaches about helping American families. One is ours, which will be in our budget, which we have just been talking about, which is an education savings account which allows a family to save up to $2,000 per year for use for an educational purpose, kindergarten through college. It is pretty straightforward. We just expanded the education savings account that was passed and signed by the President last year. 
In the President's budget, they are proposing a $2,000 solar tax credit for `photovoltaic systems'. 
What are the uses of our savings account? After-school care; tutoring for special needs kids; a computer for every schoolchild; and special education. We have been talking about it all morning. 
What would you use the solar tax credit for? Heating jacuzzis, tanning beds, mood lighting, you name it. 
Who are the beneficiaries of the education savings account? Middle- and lower-income families; phased out for those making more than $95,000 a year. As I said this morning in response to the Senator from Massachusetts, this account is pointed toward middle-income families. Seventy-percent-plus goes to families, $75,000 or less, just like the savings account the President signed into law last year. 
How about their plan? Well, the beneficiaries are wealthy people from sunny States. There is no limitation on income levels. Every movie star and rock star in the country could get this $2,000 tax credit to put a solar panel on their roof. 
The purpose of our account: Provide every child a better education; help over 10 million and 14 million middle- and lower-income families. 
What is their purpose? To combat global warming. The goal is to get solar panels on 1 million rooftops by the year 2010. 
As a matter of public policy, when we are having to make decisions and hard choices, what do you really think America feels we need? Education savings accounts for 10- to 15-million families and around 20 million children; that is, about half the school population? Or 1 million solar panels, which can only be used in sunny States, and with no income means testing at all? Like I said, every rock star in America can be a candidate for the administration's solar panel. 
If that isn't a clear distinction of where we are setting our priorities, I don't know what it is. The fact that we have an administration that is arguing for 1 million solar panels and filibustering a savings account for everyday families--not rock stars, not wealthy folks--to set up a savings account to help their kids, kindergarten through high school, I don't know what better distinguishes our two objectives. 
Mr. President, I have been very pleased with the bipartisan support of Senator Torricelli, Senator Lieberman, Senator Breaux, and others, and I hope we can end this filibuster and have a normal debate about our views on how to help education. But I find this to be a very telling comparison of our sets of priorities, with the filibustering of the savings account for average American families. We are proposing a $2,000 tax credit that anybody can take advantage of. And you know exactly who is going to use that, and it is not going to be middle America, is it? 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. At the hour of 12 noon on Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be a U.S. district judge, under a previous order. 
On Monday, during the day, there will be up to 6 hours for debate on her nomination, with additional time on Monday night and Tuesday morning. The vote in relation to her nomination will occur at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17. 
It is my hope that the Senate can clear for consideration on Monday a resolution relative to Kosovo, with a rollcall vote occurring at approximately 5:30 p.m. Also, the Senate could consider Executive Calendar nominations, resulting in an additional rollcall vote on Monday. 
On Tuesday, March 17, the Senate will debate the Massiah-Jackson nomination in the morning and conduct a rollcall vote on the cloture motion relative to the motion to proceed on the education `A+' bill at 12:15 p.m. Following our traditional recess for the party caucuses on Tuesday at 2:15 p.m, the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote relative to the Massiah-Jackson nomination. 
Therefore, one or more votes will occur on Monday at approximately 5:30 p.m, and during the day on Monday the Senate will debate the U.S. district judge nomination. On Tuesday morning, the Senate will continue the debate on the nomination and will suspend that debate at 12:15 p.m. to conduct a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to the education `A+' bill. The vote relative to the nomination will occur at 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday. Therefore, the Senate will begin voting approximately 5:30 p.m. on Monday and has two scheduled votes on Tuesday, one at 12:15 p.m. and one at 2:15 p.m.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is a bit unexpected that the other side is continuing to filibuster a very common sense educational proposal. 
We began this odyssey on June 27, 1997, when the Senate passed an amendment offered by myself to create educational savings accounts, and it passed 59-41. Subsequent to that, the President of the United States indicated that he would veto the entire tax relief package of last year if this amendment remained in the bill. We will come to that a bit later. It was then introduced as freestanding legislation, and the other side debated it, filibustered it, and indicated that the filibuster was based entirely on the fact that it had not gone through the committee appropriately. It was a procedural filibuster. So they denied the opportunity to develop the educational savings account at that time. We were unable to break their filibuster, though we received 56 votes, needing 60 to do it. I remember the other side saying it is really not a bad idea; it's just the process. 
Well, in this setting of the Congress, this legislation has now gone through the Finance Committee and has been reported to the floor 11-8 on a bipartisan basis. The legislation has been expanded considerably--which I will address in a moment--to meet the thoughts of the other side. Eighty percent of the financial impact of the legislation now, in terms of tax relief, is based on ideas from the other side. 
We come today, after finalizing the highway matter, to bring an educational proposal before the Senate, to move on with the work of the Senate, remembering that the House has already passed this. We are confronted with a filibuster. The emperor has no clothes--we have now removed everything that was brought forward by the other side and we are still in a filibuster. 
Now, the good Senator from Illinois says that this filibuster deals with two nominees for the judiciary from his State. I take the Senator at his word. But my suspicions are great. I recognize that the other side, despite what was said last year, despite what was done in the Finance Committee, is filibustering these ideas. They are defending the status quo. It's mind-boggling to me, looking at the data that we read almost on a weekly basis here about what is happening, particularly in grades kindergarten through high school, that we would be so ardently defending the status quo and standing in front of and blocking every idea coming forward--even their own ideas. 
This filibuster, in a word, is outrageous. It is prolonged far beyond process. It is nothing more than a defense of the status quo. I leave it with that word, Mr. President, `outrageous'; it is an outrageous attempt to thwart and block these new ideas that are designed to help parents and children and people trying to improve their education as we come into the new century. 
Now, Mr. President, let me talk about this idea that the other side can't seem to embrace--at least a good number of them. I must say before I proceed, Mr. President, that Senator Torricelli of New Jersey, my principal cosponsor, has been tireless in his work on the other side to promote this commonsense idea of creating education savings accounts for American families. He has been a great ally, fearless in his work of trying to take the case to his colleagues. I just can't praise his work enough. There have been others, such as Senator Breaux, in the Finance Committee, and Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, and Senator Graham of Florida who have brought meaningful ideas to the proposal that we are trying to bring to the floor to debate. If you listen to the unanimous consent proposal of the majority leader, it could not have been framed in a more balanced way to let the other side make its case and have its votes and then move on to the work of perfecting education savings accounts. 
Filibuster is the only response we have gotten. 
Filibuster. 
Now, the threat of the idea, Mr. President, is last year in the tax bill passed by the Senate, passed by the House, signed by the President in a glorious celebration at the White House--they don't come with much more pomp than the celebration of signing the balanced budget agreement and the tax relief proposal--the first balanced budget in 30 years, the first tax relief in 16 years. Embraced in that tax relief was a proposal that said that a family can save $500 per year and the interest buildup would be protected from taxation, so long as the proceeds in the account are used for higher education costs. It was means tested, which I don't generally subscribe to. It was means tested for taxpayers, as an individual making $95,000 or less, or a couple making $150,000 or less. This IRA of $500 could be used by families that met that criteria. 
So our proposal, which passed the Senate and the House and which the President could not accept and is now before us in this legislation, is quite simple. It took the $500 that the family could save every year for college, and we said that we are going to make that larger, we are going to increase it from $500 to $2,000. And, Mr. President, we said we are going to make it applicable to all education needs--not just college, but beginning in kindergarten, first, second, third, right on through high school. The account is made larger so that more money can be saved and more dollars can be made available for college and/or any educational need, kindergarten through high school. That is it. That is what is being filibustered. 
This savings account, by moving it to kindergarten through high school, allows vast new resources to be used where we are having the most difficulty. There is no higher education system in the world that competes with ours. It's true that costs are a problem, and these accounts address that. But when you look at kindergarten through high school, we don't stand up all that well to the rest of the world. So this is an attempt to make us, the parents, more able to deal with problems associated in grades kindergarten through high school or, if they want, through college or, if needed, for a disabled student even after that. So we have taken an idea that has been passed by the Senate, passed by the House, signed by the President, and expanded it to do more. And the other side is filibustering that. 
There is no difference in the criteria, the means testing, the function of the account. It is just made larger and adds more utility. It can be used in more places. Mr. President, the cost of this proposal, in the context of our budget, is pretty minuscule. Over 5 years, it allows families to save about $760 million across the Nation. But, Mr. President, it will involve, according to the Tax Committee, about 14 million families. That is almost half the families with children in elementary school years. I wish we could leverage everything like this. Because these families will be able to save this money from taxation, our estimates are that they will, on their own, save in the first 4 years nearly $5 billion for educational purposes at a minimum. Over the next 8 years, it will approach over $10 billion to $12 billion--not one of which is a tax dollar. No board of education had to raise the property tax. The Federal Government didn't have to raise new taxes. No State government did. 
These are families coming forward with the incentive that the savings will not be taxed if they are used for the children's education. This massive resource of new money will be coming to help educate America, and we are leveraging this very small amount of tax relief by a multiple of about 15. 
Again, Mr. President, you are bringing to the table billions of new dollars voluntarily. They are private dollars. They are very smart dollars. Why do I say `smart' dollars? Because these are dollars in parents' checking accounts--parents who understand the unique problem the child is having--if the child does not have a home computer, the account can be used to do that; if the child has a math deficiency, it buys a tutor; if the child cannot get to the after-school program; needs a band uniform, whatever. These accounts can go right to the targeted need. It is hard for public dollars to do that even though public dollars do good things. If the child has dyslexia and needs a special education tutor, these dollars can go right to the unique problem that the child is having. 
Mr. President, everybody wins. Most proposals we have here--I know the Presiding Officer is aware of this--take something from over here, and puts it over there. There is a winner and a loser. There are no losers in this proposal. If the child is in public school, they can take advantage of the account. If they are in private schools or religious schools or if they are homeschooled, it does not matter. Every child, no matter where they are being educated, benefits from this account; every child. 
As I said, Mr. President, it very quickly assembles billions of new, very intelligent dollars. 
In the numbers I am quoting I am not including a unique feature of this account that we do not find in other IRA savings accounts. And it is most important. This legislation allows for there to be sponsors of the account. So Mr. and Mrs. Jones open an education account on the year of the birth of their first child. As they go along, they can put whatever they can afford to save in the account. But so can the grandparents. So can the child's grandparents. So can a next-door neighbor. So can a church. Mr. President, so can an employer, or a labor union, or a benevolent association. Anyone can contribute to these accounts. 
So the numbers I have given, which are multibillions of nontax dollars being assembled to help educate America, don't even count what will happen when employers decide they are going to open up a savings account for every child of their employees, and they will match; or a situation where we have a fallen officer and the community is trying to understand what to do with the children who are left. They open a savings account. They built up that community. That community builds up savings for those children to be able to be properly educated. Or, instead of a toy that is going to be discarded after the first 24 hours of infatuation, the grandparent may make a contribution into the grandchild's education savings account. 
The ideas are limitless. We can't even contemplate the magnitude of the resources ultimately drawn to this concept and targeted to the particular needs of children. But it will be massive. 
Mr. President, one aspect of this concept for which no one can devalue is what happens when an account is opened for a specific child? A light goes on. There is a connection, almost like a massive PTA movement. From that point on, that family will be paying attention to that account. They will be setting aside resources that they otherwise would not have set aside to help their children's education, and they will because they will be thinking about it. They will be thinking about the needs of the child. They will get a regular statement from the financial institution that has the account reminding them constantly of the purpose of the education account, and the grandparent, as I said, or the extended family and neighbors, and community, the church. We have seen many stories of philanthropists trying to help 
children in inner-city schools. This will be a tool that they will use. 
My point is, Mr. President, that every time one of these accounts gets opened there has been a focused decision made to help that child through their education, and the result, therefore, as I said a moment ago, will be 14 million families who use the accounts. But how many other millions of Americans--there is no way to know--will come to these accounts and be connected to them? So vast numbers of Americans will become involved almost like a Liberty bond. I know the Presiding Officer remembers Liberty bonds and the connection that was occurring. You got them at your birthday. It was a patriotic financial commitment. But it had a benefit. It made everybody connect to the cause of the Nation. The Nation has a cause here in education. We have a crisis in kindergarten through high school. We need to start generating many ideas. This is just one, although this is a multibillion-dollar one. But we need many new ideas to start focusing the Nation's attention on making sure that our children are ready to govern the next century. 
Mr. President, I have often talked about the essence of American freedom and that it was American freedom that made us the people we are. One of the principal dynamics of American freedom is an educated population. An uneducated people cannot remain free. An uneducated mind cannot enjoy the benefits of American citizenship. Unfortunately, we are seeing too many of our young population whose futures and ability to participate in true American freedom are being stunted, and we as a Congress and people must be more focused on changing these circumstances and making sure that we leave no American child behind. This is an important tool for families. This is an important tool for corporations and other entities to help generate the resources that can be directed at the child's specific problems. 
Mr. President, the Finance Committee took the education savings account, and, as I said earlier, expanded it to include other education initiatives that are equally important. They have added relief for qualified State tuition plans. Across the Nation in about 21 States, parents are allowed to purchase contracts that lock in tomorrow's tuition costs at today's prices. 
This legislation will make savings in these plans completely tax free when they are drawn down when the child begins college. This is a very important provision, and that will not only help the 21 States who have generated these plans and allow people to decide how to prepare for college education, but the other States will join them, because once this is law more than 21 States will offer these types of plans. Plan holders will face no Federal tax on interest buildup. 
The bill also includes employer-provided educational assistance. The legislation extends the inclusion for employers who pay for their employees' tuition through 2002 and expands it to include graduate students beginning in 1998. The inclusion allows employers to pay up to $5,250 per year for educational expenses. 
The legislation will also allow school districts and other local government entities to issue up to $15 million in tax-exempt bonds for full construction. This increases the limit by 33 percent from the current $10 million. The legislation also revises the tax treatment of National Health Corps Scholarships so that these scholarships are excluded from gross income. 
So, Mr. President, in addition to the education savings account, we are dealing with parents' ability to provide for college education through prepaid State tuition plans. We are helping employers and their employees deal with continuing education, and we are helping the construction of schools across the country, particularly in small school districts. 
These ideas are representative of a very bipartisan effort on both sides of the aisle. I commend and thank each of the Senators on the Finance Committee who made these contributions, particularly Senator Breaux and Senator Graham. 
I said a little earlier before my colleague from New Jersey arrived how much I praise his work and activity on behalf of this effort. I can't say enough about it. It has been tireless. I am prepared, if the Senator from New Jersey is ready, to yield to him at this time.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, while Senator Torricelli is still here, I want to pose a couple questions. 
Those who have objected to the proposal have essentially made two cases: One, that this would benefit upper-income individuals. While the Senator is here, I want to point out--I know he will agree--that the criteria for the education savings account are identical to the education savings account for higher education that we passed and that the President has signed--same means testing, the same concept of directing, as the Senator alluded to, 70 to 75 percent of the funds to those making $75,000 or less. 
But the key point is we have already passed a savings account. It is just that it is only for $500 and only for college. We have taken the same account and expanded it to $2,000 and kindergarten through high school or disabled student after-college. I am perplexed that, having passed this and signed it and celebrated it, we are still hearing arguments that this would somehow enrich the rich. I wonder if the Senator might comment.

Mr. COVERDELL. My last question--and the Senator has already hit on the point--and that is, if you will read some of the material from the opponents, you will think this is legislation exclusively designed to deal with private schools. As the Senator pointed out, 70 percent of the families using the accounts have children in public schools. Billions and billions of dollars will end up enriching students' ability to function in public schools. It is almost as if they would like to leave that part of the equation out.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for the last hour we have heard from myself and others, Senator Torricelli, about the massive benefits that would come to American families if we enact and make possible the tool of an education savings account for families to use for their children, no matter where they go to school, public, private, home, whether it is kindergarten through college or after if the student is disabled. Anybody watching this just has to wonder, well, why in the world are we in a filibuster? 
How can an idea like this be thwarted, tacks thrown on the road in front of it? Why are we in a filibuster? Who would oppose it? It has been described as a win-win situation. As I said, any child, in any condition, and any family dealing with those conditions can benefit. 
So why the opposition? Well, they said, the money is going to get in somebody's hands who does not need it. They are too wealthy. We have heard that around here for the last quarter of a century. I just want to remind everybody that the criteria that governs this savings account is identical, the same, no deviation from the one the President signed at the White House last year. 
Both sides of the aisle--Republicans, Democrats; House, Senate and President--have all sanctioned, certified, that we should have a savings account for college costs. We said the number will be $500 per year. Then we means tested it to make sure that it was pushed into middle income and down. 
Well, we have taken that account and we have said, instead of $500, we will let them save up to $2,000. Instead, of just 4 years of college, they can use it kindergarten through college. After all, the problem we have is in kindergarten through high school. Everything else we left the same. It still pushes the resources to the utilization and benefit of the middle class or lower. We know that 75 percent of all these funds will go to help those families. 
So it is a mischievous argument to divert attention. It is a misrepresentation. It is not so. It is identical to what we have already embraced as the appropriate governing criteria for an education savings account and celebrated with enormous glory at the White House last fall. 
I also add, Mr. President, that all of this money is generated because we give minimal tax relief to anybody who puts it in a savings account. Over the next 5 years, it is $760 million--over 5 years--of tax relief. I wish we could do this in a lot of different areas. That $760 million causes American families, 14 million of them, to put about $5 billion in savings accounts. That is a 15-1 leverage. Don't we wish we could do that in many, many arenas? 
By offering that limited incentive, Americans come forward and redirect their own money, put it into savings accounts to help educate their children--a massive amount of funds generated by this limited effort on our behalf. It is just incredible to see the resulting activity that occurs by creating this savings account. 
So that argument gets buried pretty quickly. It is a little hard to argue that you thought that was just such a great idea and you had protected it for the middle class and less last year, and then take the same criteria and say, well, somehow it is different this year. It isn't. 
Then, Mr. President, the other side would like everybody to think this is an instrument for people who are in a private school or a religious school, that the entire purpose of these savings accounts is for people outside the public school system. 
The NEA has written a letter to everybody that says that. I would expect more of them, because it just isn't so. As we have said, 70 percent of the families using the accounts will be using them to help children in public schools. Only 30 percent will be helping children in private schools. 
The grand aggregate of the money, if we only focus on kindergarten through high school, is about split, about half these resources--again private; these are private dollars, not tax dollars--will be going to help students do better in public schools, and about half of it will be helping students in private. 
Why isn't it still divided 70-30? It is because they tend to consume, in the private school, most of the money for tuition. It is more expensive. So their savings accounts probably are larger and they have to spend it more quickly and in larger sums. But, still, about half, about $2.5 billion, in 4 years, rushes to public schools and about $2.5 billion for private. At the end of the day who is the beneficiary? American children. 
We are going to divert money from public schools, they say. No. These are private dollars. These are not tax dollars--after-tax savings, after-tax savings--all private dollars. Anybody who sends a child to private school is paying for public school through the property taxes. There is no money diverted. 
Now, what is the real story? Because it isn't any of this other it cannot substantiate. The real opposition is that some families, in the big picture statistically insignificant, but some families will open a savings account and will make a decision to use the account to pay for tuition in a private school. Some parents will do that, and that is the rub. 
That is the reason the President said last year, `I'll veto the tax bill if this idea is in it.' That is the reason, when we brought this bill to the floor last year, the other side filibustered it. And that is the reason we cannot even get to this bill today, because the other side is filibustering it, because some handful of families, using their own money, would make a decision that they need to put their child in a different school. 
And, Heaven forbid, Washington has to stand in their way with a roadblock, a filibuster. By trying to keep those few families, whoever they would be, from doing that, they would snatch $2.5 billion out of helping children in public schools, they would snatch $2.5 billion away from families trying to help their children in private or home schools. 
They would cause 14 million savings accounts never to open. They would deny all those corporations that could contribute to the accounts, all those parents and grandparents, all the matching ideas that would participate in these accounts, they would disallow it, stop it. 
Millions of families will be denied, 20 million-plus children will not have the benefit of this redirection of family resources, thousands of public school teachers will not become tutors, hundreds of thousands of home computers will not show up in the home, inner city schools where they only have 15 percent of the population with home computers will stay 15 percent instead of going up because we have generated a pool of money to buy those computers. And they will have done it in the name of keeping a handful of families from making a decision that they want to move from one school to another. 
That, Mr. President, is what this filibuster is all about. It is outrageous. Unbelievably, unfortunately, if they are ultimately successful, the mountains of good where everybody succeeds and wins will be packed away in some closet on some shelf over that thread of concern. It shows you, Mr. President, the depth of despair of the status quo, that they would come to this point and deny all that good over that single point.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for the next few minutes I will make limited remarks prior to the introduction of two separate joint resolutions that deal with the administration's recent certification of Mexico dealing with the losing drug war, and that deal, in my judgment, was a more appropriate approach to this situation. 
Mr. President, I consider myself as a person somewhat surprised by the New York Times editorial of Saturday, February 28, 1998; the headline of the editorial, `Certifiably Wrong On Mexico.' 
The Clinton administration does no favor to Mexico or its own credibility by certifying that Mexico is `fully cooperating' in the fight against drug trafficking. Compounding the damage, the White House Drug Policy Director, Barry McCaffrey, fatuously claims that Mexican cooperation is `absolutely superlative.' 
According to this editorial, 
A more truthful assessment can be found in the Drug Enforcement Administration's confidential evaluation, described by Tim Golden in yesterday's Times. The DEA concludes that `the Government of Mexico has not accomplished its counter-narcotic goals or succeeded in cooperation with the U.S. Government.' Mexican trafficking has increased, the DEA notes, and the corruption of its enforcement agencies `continues unabated.' 
Though Washington finds it diplomatically inconvenient to acknowledge, Mexico has a chronic problem with drug traffickers who always seem to be able to secure the political influence they need to avoid arrest and prosecution. This drug corruption greases the flow of narcotics into the United States. Mexico's drug networks span the border, supplying cocaine, heroin, and marijuana to American users. 
Mr. President, in a hearing last week, I indicated, along with Senator Feinstein of California, that we would be introducing resolutions, the purpose of which would be to change this course between the United States and Mexico on this matter. It would be our goal that the process would decertify Mexico on this matter with a Presidential waiver in the national interest in which I believe we both concur. This would be an honest appraisal of our circumstances. 
The problem with certifying is that it sends a message to the vast populations of the United States and of Mexico that this war is being won, that we have turned a corner, that things are working out. That simply is not the case. I think it does a disservice to the entire population of both countries for us to send a message of victory when, indeed, the message is one of gravity and loss. 
This situation has grave consequences for the people of the United States. I have to say that the United States shares enormous responsibility in this struggle. My remarks are not intended to castigate or single out Mexico; quite to the contrary; I view them as a great ally. They are a great trading partner. We share this hemisphere. We have mutual goals--democratic goals. But neither country seems to want to face the fact that it is losing a precious struggle. 
In 1991, the drug interdiction budget for the United States was $2.03 billion; today it is $1.44 billion. That is a dramatic reduction in our commitment. In 1992, the United States stopped, seized 440 kilograms of cocaine and marijuana a day; in 1995, it had been cut in half; we only stopped 205 kilograms of cocaine and marijuana per day. 
What does this all mean? In shorthand, it means that about 3 million teenagers aged 12-16 are using drugs today that weren't in 1991. To give an example, in 1991, 400,000 eighth-graders had used an illicit drug in the last year. In 1996 and 1997, that number rose to 920,000. In 10th grade, 600,000 had used a drug in 1991; in 1996 and 1997, it had doubled to 1.2 million children. In 12th grade, 600,000 in 1991; 1.1 million, almost doubled again, in 1996 and 1997. 
So by not confronting this directly and honesty, we are all contributing to the accelerated rate of children using drugs and we are going to pay a price for this the likes of which we have never seen. 
I will yield to the Senator from California in just a moment, but first I quote a story of a top administrative official on this. It ran in the Phoenix papers.  
`Our current interdiction efforts almost completely fail to achieve our purpose of reducing the flow of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamines across the (Southwest) [the Mexican] border,' said Francis X. Kinney, director of strategic planning for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. . . . 
Kinney said the United States will continue to be overrun by drug traffic at the U.S.-Mexican border unless it emphasizes improved intelligence and high-tech screening equipment. . . 
The last thing he said addresses the Senator from California: 
`They [the Congress] want us to call it like it is, not to be an apologist,' alluding to the U.S. Congress. 
I think this gentleman is absolutely correct. 
Mr. President, I send a joint resolution to the desk and ask for its appropriate referral.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in concluding and yielding to the Senator from California, I just want to make it clear that the purpose of these two joint resolutions is to alter the course of our engagement in the drug war, principally as it relates to Mexico. Instead of certifying and saying, `Here is a message of victory to the two peoples of the two Nations,' it decertifies with a national security waiver and calls it like it is and refocuses our Governments and our people in a combined effort to win this battle and not lose it--to win it for the millions of children that are suffering, because we are losing it.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge March 3 as Peace Corps Day, celebrating the 37th anniversary this past Sunday of President Kennedy signing the legislation that created the Peace Corps on March 1, 1961. As a former Director of the Peace Corps I want to pay tribute to that organization as an example of Americans at their best. 
Since 1961, more than 150,000 Americans from all across the nation have served in the Peace Corps in over 132 countries. Today nearly 6,500 volunteers currently serve in the 84 countries, addressing critical development needs on a person-to-person level, helping communities gain access to clean water; grow more food; prevent the spread of AIDS; teach English, math, and science; help entrepreneurs start new businesses; and work to protect the environment. 
Peace Corps volunteers have improved the lives of many people abroad during their terms of service. They have rightly earned great respect and admiration for the American people and for American values. But they have also brought the benefits of their experience home and continued to contribute to their own communities and to our nation as volunteers and in leadership positions. Returned Peace Corps volunteers find their experience, their knowledge of other cultures, and the self-assurance they gain stand them in good stead in their own careers. But they also share the benefits of their time in the Peace Corps with many others. We call this the `Domestic Dividend.' 
To commemorate Peace Corps Day, more than 5,000 current and returned volunteers will go back to school today to speak with students about their overseas experiences, some via satellite or phone, but most in person. This is part of the agency's global education program `World Wise Schools.' Today more than 350,000 students in all 50 states will learn about life in communities of the developing world by talking the volunteers who have lived there. For example, Peace Corps Volunteer Amy Medley will get to talk to her pen pals from Walden Middle School in Atlanta, Georgia for the first time. She will be calling from Africa, where she is currently serving as a science teacher in Eritrea. 
As we celebrate today, interest in the Peace Corps is growing. In 1997 more than 150,000 individuals contacted the Peace Corps to request information on serving as a volunteer, an increase of more than 40 percent since 1994. In view of this interest and the tremendous success and record of the Peace Corps, President Clinton has called for an expansion of the Peace Corps in his 1999 budget, putting the agency on a path to fielding 10,000 volunteers in the year 2000. This is a request and a goal I strongly support. 
Mr. President, for 37 years, the Peace Corps has extended a helping hand to the world and Peace Corps volunteers have demonstrated in countless ways the generosity and dedication to service that is so much a part of the American character. So I will take this opportunity to salute all of our Peace Corps volunteers, past and present, and to thank them for their service. We appreciate all they have done and continue to do and I look forward to seeing the Peace Corps continue its outstanding record of service into the 21st Century.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Atlanta-based National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) recently represented the United States at the World Youth Consultation for a 21st Century Free of Drugs, sponsored by UNESCO and the United Nations Drug Control Program on February 9 in Paris. 
Jody Cameron and Gary Lewis, members of the PRIDE staff, joined 21 young people from other nations in drafting a Youth Charter for a 21st Century Free of Drugs that will be presented to the United Nations General Assembly in June. The charter will establish a global network of youth programs for drug abuse prevention. 
PRIDE was the only American youth-serving organization invited to attend the meeting at UNESCO headquarters. Cameron and Lewis will also take part in a subsequent meeting in Alberta, Canada in April and at the Special Session on Drugs of the UN General Assembly in New York this summer. 
As one who has long worked with the PRIDE organization, I commend them for the recognition of their leadership in the drug use prevention arena that is signified by their participation in these important UN efforts and know that the United States could not ask for more outstanding representation in these venues.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, yesterday's Wall Street Journal lead editorial entitled `Sanctity of the Ballot' should be a wakeup call for America's citizens. Sadly, we can no longer assume public officials tasked with protecting your vote are able to do so. The fact is, passage of the Motor Voter Act has led to growing incidences of election fraud in communities large and small, and the problem is getting worse all the time. 
The editorial highlights an important new national organization, the Voting Integrity Project (VIP), which was formed in 1996 in response to the growing abuses highlighted by the Journal. VIP is a non-profit, non-partisan coalition of citizens and civic groups. It organizes and trains citizens to protect the integrity of the vote in their own community. It also investigates and litigates important election fraud cases, including constitutional issues. It is the only independent, national organization performing this important work. 
Mr. President, VIP has learned that it is nearly impossible to overturn elections once they have been certified and places its emphasis accordingly, in pro-active programs run by the citizens themselves. Indeed, American voters need to wake up to the harsh reality of today's election process and begin to equip themselves, through organizations such as VIP, to guard the sanctity of their communities' elections and their vote.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues a speech which I believe provides a number of important ideas and policy positions we should be discussing as we enter the era of budget surpluses. 
Because of strong economic growth, the Office of Management and Budget reports that we will begin running a surplus in 2001, and that surplus will total $447 billion by 2005. 
In a speech before the Detroit Economic Club on February 17, Senator Abraham sought to start a dialogue on how best we as a nation could approach the upcoming and unaccustomed circumstance of budget surpluses. In my view he offered excellent suggestions on how to save Social Security, provide comprehensive tax reform and invest in infrastructure and human capital, all within the confines of a limited budget surplus. 
His specific proposals, limited private investment accounts within the Social Security system, an alternative flat tax and scholarships for low income students entering hi-tech fields, all deserve our attention. It is my hope that they will help spur fruitful debate concerning how we can best approach the new century with continued economic growth, expanding opportunity and confidence in our fellow citizens.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, over the weekend, President Clinton used his radio address to call for Senate action on the Reading Excellence Act which seeks to address our Nation's literacy crisis. Under the leadership of House Education and Workforce chairman, Bill Goodling, this bill passed the other body unanimously in November 1997. I have introduced similar legislation in the Senate as S. 1596. The Reading Excellence Act is also a key component of the Senate Republican leadership's education package, the Better Opportunities for Our Kids and Schools Act, or `BOOKS'. While I am pleased that the President has urged passage of our legislation, it should be clear to everyone that our approach represents a clear contrast to the literacy initiative the President had initially proposed. Having said that, we welcome President Clinton to real education reform--you've come a long way. 
We clearly have a literacy crisis in this Nation when four out of 10 of our third-graders can't read. Without basic reading skills, many of these children will be shut out of the workforce of the 21st century. According to the 1993 National Audit Literacy Survey, more than 40 million Americans cannot read a phone book, menu or the directions on a medicine bottle. Those who can't learn to read are not only less likely to get a good job, they are disproportionately represented in the ranks of the unemployed and the homeless. Consider the fact that 75 percent of unemployed adults, 33 percent of mothers on welfare, 85 percent of juveniles appearing in court and 60 percent of prison inmates are illiterate. 
Although over $8 billion is spent by the Federal Government each year to promote literacy, little progress has been made. Last year, President Clinton recognized this problem, but his `America Reads' proposal offered more of the same. Under the President's plan, the government would recruit one million volunteers to teach reading, under the direction of AmeriCorps. Rather than relying on a million untrained volunteers to teach reading to our young children, we offered a better approach which the President has now endorsed: Let's help our reading teachers do a better job. Our legislation, the Reading Excellence Act, would accomplish the following: 
First, our bill would focus on training teachers to teach reading--less than 10 percent of our teachers have received formal instruction on how to teach reading. Moreover, we would ensure that teachers are taught in methods proven by sound scientific research to be effective, such as phonics. 
Second, the Reading Excellence Act authorizes grants for extra tutorial assistance for at-risk kids. Parents with children experiencing reading difficulties could apply for funds to purchase extra help from a list of providers supplied by their school. 
Third, our bill provides literacy assistance for parents so they can be their children's first and most important teacher. It also ensures that 95% of the literacy funds are driven to the classroom where they will help kids the most. 
In last year's appropriations process, $210 million was appropriated for a literacy program, contingent on passage of an authorization bill by July 1, 1998. As I stated, the House has already unanimously passed this bill. It is now up to the Senate to act on similar legislation before the schools let out for summer. The Reading Excellence Act will provide today's children the tools to be successful in tomorrow's workforce. Helping to ensure every child can read is one of the best jobs skills, welfare initiatives or crime bills we can pass this Congress.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, colleagues, I rise on this 25th anniversary of the return of the first American POWs from Vietnam to recognize the National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia and the many years and tireless hours Ann Mills Griffiths, the National League of Families' Executive Director, and JoAnne Shirley, Chairwoman of the League's Board and a fellow Georgian, have spent fighting for the return of American POW's and MIA's. 
The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia was incorporated in the District of Columbia on May 28, 1970. Voting membership is comprised solely of the wives, children, parents and other close relatives of Americans who were or are listed as prisoners of war, missing in action, killed in action/body not recovered and returned Vietnam War U.S. POWs. Associate membership is comprised of extended relation of POW/MIAs who do not meet voting membership requirements and concerned citizens. The League is a non-profit, non-partisan organization financed by contributions from the families, veterans and concerned citizens. The League's sole purpose is to obtain the release of all prisoners, the fullest possible accounting for the missing and repatriation of all recoverable remains of those who died serving our nation during the Vietnam War. 
The League originated on the west coast in the late 1960's. The wife of a ranking POW who believed that the U.S. Government's policy of keeping a low profile on the POW/MIA issue and encouraging the families to refrain from publicly discussing the problem was unjustified, initiated a loosely organized movement which evolved into the National League of Families. 
In October 1968, the first POW/MIA story was published. As a result of that publicity, the families began communicating with each other, and the group grew in strength from 50 to 100 to 300 and upward. Small POW/MIA family groups flooded the North Vietnamese delegation in Paris with inquiries regarding the prisoners and missing; the first major activity in which hundreds of families participated. 
Eventually, the necessity for formal incorporation was recognized. In May 1970, a special AD HOC meeting of the families met at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. During this meeting the League's charter and by-laws were adopted. 
A seven-member board of directors meets regularly to determine League policy and direction. The board is elected by the voting membership which now stands at approximately 1,000. Regional coordinators, responsible for activities in multi-state areas, and state coordinators also represent the League in most of the fifty states. 
The League's national office is now staffed by only one full-time employee, augmented by concerned citizen and family member volunteers. The executive director, the sister of a soldier MIA and the organization's chief executive officer, is responsible for management of the League and Implementation of policies established by the membership and board of directors. 
In 1971, Mrs. Michael Hoff, an MIA wife and member of the National League, recognized the need for a symbol representing our POW/MIAs. Prompted by an article in the Jacksonville, FL Times-Union, Mrs. Hoff contacted Norman Rivkees, VP of Annin & Company, which had made a banner for the newest member of the UN, the People's Republic of China, as a part of their policy to provide flags to all UN member states. Mrs. Hoff found Mr. Rivkees very sympathetic to the POW/MIA issue, and he along with Annin's advertising agency, designed a flag to represent our missing men. Following the National League's approval, the flags were manufactured for distribution. On March 9, 1989, a flag which flew over the White House on the 1988 National POW/MIA Recognition Day, was installed in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, as a result of legislation passed overwhelmingly during the 100th Congress. On August 10, 1990, the 101st Congress passed U.S. Public Law 101-355, which recognized the National League's POW/MIA flag and designated it `as the symbol of our Nation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, thus ending the uncertainty for their families and the Nation.' This POW/MIA flag is now recognized world wide, by all concerned, as the universal symbol of the `UNACCOUNTED FOR'. 
Mrs. Ann Mills Griffiths serves as Executive Director of the National League of POW/MIA Families, a position held since August, 1978. Mrs. Griffiths' brother, Lt. Commander James B. Mills, USNR, has been missing since September 21, 1966, when the Navy F4C on which he served as a Radar Intercept Officer was lost on a night mission over North Vietnam. 
Prior to assuming her position as executive director, Mrs. Griffiths was an elected member of the League's board of directors for four years, serving as legislative chairman. During its existence from 1980 through 1992, she played an active role in the U.S. Government's POW/MIA Interagency Group, representing the families' views in development of official policy to resolve this humanitarian issue. 
Mrs. Griffiths has traveled extensively for discussion with senior officials of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, as well as the countries of ASEAN. She was instrumental in facilitating high level negotiations between Vietnam and the United States in 1983 and participated in fourteen U.S. Government policy-level POW/MIA delegations to Hanoi since 1982, plus two League delegations in 1982 and 1994. 
Acknowledged as an expert on the POW/MIA issue, Mrs. Griffiths regularly meets with senior administration officials and members of congress, appears before congressional committees, addresses national and international audiences, participates in appropriate policy seminars, publishes articles and newsletters, and is a frequent spokeswoman on network and cable television programs. 
Within policy established by the membership and elected board of directors, Mrs. Griffiths has been instrumental in building the League from a small POW/MIA family group into a nationally recognized, non-profit organization that influences U.S. policy to resolve the humanitarian POW/MIA issue. In administering the Leagues' affairs, Mrs. Griffiths supervises 
League operations, manages a successful direct-mail program and plans the League's yearly convention that includes the highest levels of the U.S. Government. With the assistance of their staff and volunteer state and regional officials, Mrs. Griffiths also coordinates a nation-wide awareness program on the issue. 
Mrs. JoAnne Shirley has been serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors since June 1995. Her brother, Maj. Bobby Marvin Jones, M.D., USAF Flight Surgeon, was shot down November 28, 1972, near DaNang, South Vietnam. 
Mrs. Shirley is married to Dr. Rudy Shirley, MS., and ENT doctor, and they reside in Dalton, Georgia, with their three children Bobby, Rhett and Chrissie. She served on the School Board for 10 years, and has been a volunteer in many community, county and state sponsored projects. 
Mrs. Shirley co-founded the Georgia Committee for POW/MIA, Inc in the 1980s and served as Georgia State Coordinator for the National League of Families from 1983-1993. She served as Secretary of the National League of 1993-94, and then as Vice-Chairman from 1994-95. In 1997, Mrs. Shirley, by herself, raised $15,000 to fund her and Mrs. Griffiths' trip to Southeast Asia. 
Mr. President, these two women who are wives, mothers, and involved citizens have spent countless hours, money and resources keeping accountability alive. Nothing strikes a louder chord with Americans than the thought of our soldiers in the hands of our country's enemies. It is important that we recognize the work of organizations such as the National League of Families and of people such as Ann Mills Griffiths and JoAnne Shirley who have worked hard to ensure we do not forget those soldiers who were left behind.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to take a special moment here to thank my colleague from Georgia, a cosponsor of this resolution and himself a veteran of the Vietnam war; Senator Smith of New Hampshire; Senator Lott, the majority leader; and Senator Hagel, a Vietnam veteran from Nebraska. I am especially delighted to be joined by Senator Cleland who, as I said, is himself a testament to the courage and sacrifice made by so many men and women in American uniform during the Vietnam conflict. 
The resolution also directs itself to two of our colleagues who were themselves long-held prisoners of war, Congressman Sam Johnson, who is specifically noted in the resolution, and our own Senator John McCain of Arizona. 
Senator McCain and I have known each other for some extended period of time and I have always marveled at what he endured and, I might add, that it was almost a double endurance. What I mean is that the North Vietnamese, recognizing that he was the son of a U.S. Navy admiral, tried to break him away from his colleagues and send him home. He made the choice not to accept, not to accept this unique tension in deference to his colleagues, his father and the Navy. 
I was reminded earlier today that when these veterans were returned and disembarked from the aircraft--of course we all remember the scenes of them kneeling down and kissing the ground--but then to stand up and thank America for the privilege to have served her. It was an incredible act of courage, an act of care and love, of the country whose uniforms they had worn. 
Interestingly enough, unbeknownst to me just earlier, I was with a young man who said but for the brief chance of fate he would have been a pilot in Vietnam. This was just moments ago and he was here when these POW's returned, and he had a chance to be among them. At that time he was about 33, which was the age of many of these POW's, the difference being, of course, that he still looked 33 and they looked 50 or older because of what they had endured. He was reminded about how moving the moment was to see these Americans who had returned, who had endured so much, who had become the epitome of courage and perseverance. He says whenever he is reminded of it, it still sends chills down his back. How much we owe these men and women. It is important that we remember. 
Whenever a nation embarks on something like this--and perhaps it is uniquely important that we are remembering, considering the discussions that are underway here this very week, discussing the eve of a major conflict--we remember what these men and women did for America. 
Of course, today marks the 25th anniversary of the return of the first POWs from North Vietnam. Following the signing of the peace accords, 591 United States prisoners of war were released. The operation was dubbed `Operation Homecoming.' Today, as was noted in the resolution, there are still 2,000 members of our Armed Forces who remain unaccounted for from the Vietnam conflict. 
This resolution recognizes that despite the brutal mistreatment these prisoners received, they nevertheless devised a means to communicate with one another, to support one another by a code transmitted by tapping on the wall. The resolution refers to Commander James B. Stockdale, U.S. Navy, who upon his capture on September 9, 1965, became the senior prisoner of war officer in what became dubbed the `Hanoi Hilton.' He delivered the following message to his men to sustain their morale: `Remember, you are Americans. With faith in God, trust in one another, and devotion to your country, you will overcome, you will triumph.' 
This resolution resolves that the Senate expresses its gratitude for and calls upon all Americans to reflect upon and show their gratitude for the courage and sacrifice of the brave men who were held prisoners of war during the Vietnam conflict, particularly on the occasion of this, the 25th anniversary of Operation Homecoming, their return from captivity. It also resolves that the Senate, indeed America, will not, must not, forget the more than 2,000 members of the United States Armed Forces that remain unaccounted for in the Vietnam conflict, and that the Senate will continue to press for the fullest possible accounting for such members. 
Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, for his cosponsorship, more importantly for his service, his long service, Senator Smith, Senator Lott and Senator Hagel of Nebraska. 
In closing I simply say on behalf of all Americans, this American says to all who served under such difficult circumstances, a grateful Nation says thank you.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--The Federal Facilities Community Right-To-Know Act of 1998--which provides that the federal government is held to the same reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 as private entities. In 1986, Congress directed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a national inventory to inform the public about chemicals used and released in their communities. Since enactment of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, manufacturers have been required to keep extensive records on how they use and store hazardous chemicals and report releases of hundreds of hazardous chemicals annually. EPA compiles the reported information into the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). 
The Toxic Release Inventory is a publicly available data base containing specific chemical release and transfer information from manufacturing facilities throughout the United States. The TRI is intended to promote planning for chemical emergencies and to provide information to the public regarding the presence and release of toxic and hazardous chemicals in their communities. 
In August 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12856, which required Federal facilities to begin submitting TRI reports beginning in calendar year 1994 activities. I commend President Clinton for taking this action. However, this executive order does not have the force of law and could be changed by a future Administration. The National Governors Association's policy on federal facilities states that `Congress should ensure that federal and state `right to know' requirements apply to federal facilities.' My legislation simply amends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act to cover federal facilities. It is important for the Federal government to protect the environment and its citizens from hazardous substances. People living near federal facilities have the right to know what hazardous substances are being released into the environment by these facilities so they can better protect themselves and their children from these potential threats. It is my strong belief that federal facilities should be treated the same as private entities. My legislation attempts to moves us closer towards that goal.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. My remarks were made last night. In essence, the amendment by my distinguished colleague from Virginia vitiates or makes moot the entire effort of the bill. His amendment has the effect of nullifying what we have been endeavoring to do throughout the week. 
I might take another second to say that several of these amendments that have been offered--and I see the Senator from Nevada here--have considerable merit and substance. The problem is that we have used the week in a very inefficient way. I have been up very late last evening and early this morning endeavoring to resolve this matter and deal with some of these amendments that don't nullify the legislation, but there is not time now to deal with this effectively with the House and meet the attempt to have this occur on the President's birthday. So the week has cost us the ability to resolve some of the other issues. In any event, I would have been opposed to the amendment offered by the good Senator from Virginia. 
I yield the floor.

I appreciate very much what he and my colleague from Texas are endeavoring to do. As I said to him this morning, I look forward to joining with him in his attempt to prospectively deal with these kinds of issues in the future. I am very appreciative of his collegiality. 
I would say, as I have said repeatedly, that there are certain extraordinary conditions associated with the manner in which we are dealing with this issue. The former President's birthday is this Friday, and he is facing the most difficult battle he has faced in his life. And he has faced many. This is a spontaneous response to that. I will leave it at that. But I do want to again thank the Senator from Connecticut and make known that I intend to join with him in his efforts prospectively to deal with these sorts of matters. 
I yield back all time.

We do have a logistical problem here in terms of--and we have spent the better part of the week perhaps in a less efficient manner than we could have, and it has robbed me of the opportunity to iron the way on the other side, so I regretfully will in a moment move to table the amendment. 
It may not be much comfort to the Senator from Nevada at this time, but I would welcome working with him. Obviously, there have been a number of assertions made about the individual to which the Senator from Nevada takes umbrage. It is a complex issue, and as I said I simply do not have time, given where we are in the week and what we are attempting to do, to resolve the matter in the House. So for that reason, Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am proud to join the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Senator Hatch, and others in introducing a constitutional amendment to prohibit the desecration of the flag of the United States of America. In the 104th Congress we fell a mere four votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed for the Senate's approval of a similar amendment. I encourage my colleagues to join in this effort and hope we will be able to address this matter before the end of the year. 
In a 1989 Supreme Court case, Texas versus Johnson, the Court erroneously ruled, by the narrowest of margins, 5 to 4, that flag burning is a constitutionally protected expression of First Amendment free speech rights. Again in 1990, in U.S. versus Eichman, the Supreme Court protected flag desecration by declaring unconstitutional a federal statute designed to protect our flag. I remain dumbfounded by these decisions. Former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, generally regarded as a First Amendment absolutist once stated `It passes my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense.' It passes my belief as well. 
It is my belief that the American flag does not belong to one person; it belongs to the American people. When an individual desecrates a flag I believe he does not destroy private property but a national symbol, a public monument. Just as an individual cannot spray paint the Washington Monument as an exercise of free speech, nor should he be able to vandalize the American flag. I believe the American flag is `franchised' to individuals who wish to display it. Thus, those who choose to display an American flag have an obligation to the American people and to the country to maintain and respect it. 
For more than 200 years Old Glory has symbolized hope, opportunity, justice and most of all, freedom. For this very reason our flag was protected from desecration by federal laws and laws in 48 states for many years. It is the will of the people that the States and Congress have the power to protect our national symbol. Let us now act on that will. 
Mr. President, it is my firm belief that this constitutional amendment would protect our flag without jeopardizing the First Amendment. It would overturn these erroneous interpretations and would place flag desecration in the same category as other forms of illegal expression including libel, slander and obscenity. I believe the unique nature of Old Glory ensures a constitutional amendment protecting it from desecration would not impinge upon citizens' First Amendment rights nor would it establish a dangerous precedent. It would simply prohibit offensive conduct with respect to our nation's most revered symbol. I urge my colleagues to support this most important amendment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first let me say to both the majority leader and the minority leader that the author and the cosponsors of S. 1575 are pleased that we were able to come to terms on the process by which we manage the legislation that would name Washington National Airport the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in memory of a great President of the United States. We hopefully are still on a timeframe by which this could be done in time for his birthday, which is this Friday. He will celebrate his 87th birthday. 
The agreement is consistent with the argument that we have made all along that this is a memorial. The amendment process should be related to the context of the memorial, and extraneous issues should not have been a part of the amendment process. There is an integrity in this unanimous consent. All of these amendments are relevant, and all of them relate to the concept of whether this ought to be done or not. 
We just heard from the Senator from Nebraska about his agreement or concurrence with the agreement that we would bring up IRS reform by April 15th. I, too, echo his agreement that that be done. But I did not believe it ought to be a part of this memorial. It diminished the nature of this for it to become a legislative vehicle for extraneous matters. No matter how important they are, they should not have been dealt with in the context of the memorial to former President Reagan. 
I see the Senator from Nevada is present. I ask, if I might, is he here on behalf of the amendment under the agreement that we have just agreed to?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Nevada for his opening acknowledgement about the appropriateness of this legislation to honor former President Reagan. I appreciate his acknowledgement of the nature of the timeframe, that we are wanting to do this in conjunction with the President's 87th birthday. 
I thank the Senator from Nevada for acknowledging that, indeed, this is a very unique period in the twilight years of the former President, and that he is bravely and courageously struggling with an illness; that he has used that illness as a last attempt to do public good by calling attention to its nature and highlighting the problem to the Nation. And I appreciate very much those generous remarks on behalf of the former President. 
With regard to the presentations the Senator has made on behalf of his amendment, there will be a recorded vote up or down, and the Members of the Senate may make their decision as to their agreement or not with whether or not the current name of the FBI building would be removed and left to future congressional action to determine if another name should so honor the building. 
I also agree with the Senator in his admiration of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It has had some difficult times, but clearly it has been throughout our history an instrument to which the American public looked for security and integrity. 
Today, of course, the central objective is to fulfill the goal of S. 1575 which is to honor former President Reagan in this very fitting way by redesignation of Washington National Airport as Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
I thought it might be useful, Mr. President, to share some of the Nation's efforts to encourage the Congress and the President to get this job done by Friday. Resolutions are being introduced and passed throughout the country in support of the renaming of National Airport for President Reagan. On January 16, 1998, the California assembly passed a resolution in support of this legislation. Of course, it is extremely fitting because former President Reagan was twice elected Governor of the great State of California, where he served successfully and with integrity and purpose. I have been told that a similar resolution was introduced yesterday in the South Dakota Senate by Senator Alan Aiker and in the Maine House of Representatives by Representative Adam Mack. The Alabama House of Representatives, my neighboring State, has passed a resolution in support of the redesignation of National Airport. The Arizona Senate has passed a resolution in like support of redesignation. The Idaho, Illinois, and Ohio legislatures will introduce resolutions next week. In Wisconsin, a resolution has been introduced and will be voted on this week. In addition, on February 6, President Reagan's 87th birthday, the Wisconsin legislature will vote on a plan to name the new Department of Administration building in Madison after former President Ronald Reagan. 
Mr. President, I am glad this short-lived filibuster has come to an end and that we can move on to resolution of this legislation. 
As I said when we began the debate on this legislation, there are fewer than 12 namesakes of former President Reagan. As indicated by the Senator from Nevada, assuming the success of this legislation, I think we are going to see a growing crescendo across the country. As we look back on the Reagan Presidency, if you had to find a word that characterized it, it was `optimism'--optimism, a complete belief in the spirit and nature of the American people. Historically, there are very few eras for which the principles of American freedom were more center point, almost on a par in a sense with the founding. President Reagan's policies unleashed unprecedented economic liberty, created millions and millions of new jobs, created unprecedented growth, created and made the value of economic liberty fall into the homes of millions and millions of Americans across this country. 
Sometimes when we talk about American liberty we tend to 
focus on the component of keeping ourselves free from impoundment by adversarial forces, the Axis powers and Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein. But one of the critical components of American liberty is economic liberty. We fought the War of Independence over economic liberty. And there has not been another American leader so committed to it as was former President Ronald Reagan. He fought for it throughout his entire life and, as President, implemented policies that enriched it in every corner. 
Having said that, he was also one of the strongest proponents of defending our freedom through strength, and as we said over the last several days his strong conviction with regard to the Soviet Union, which he labeled `the evil empire,' was unprecedented in changing the fortunes of world history as he brought down the Berlin Wall and he brought down the Soviet Union's grasp over millions of people in the world. So he was seeing to liberty not only at home but liberty abroad. 
Mr. President, I see the Senator from Nevada is seeking recognition, and I will yield the floor to the Senator at this time.

that this is an intrusion into local matters. This is, of course, an amendment that I would encourage all my colleagues to oppose. I would just cite the Federal law that contemporarily governs Washington National. It says: 
The Federal Government has a continuing but limited interest in the operation of the two Federally-owned airports which serve the travel and cargo needs of the entire metropolitan Washington region as well as the District of Columbia and the national seat of Government. 
To be candid about it, I think if it weren't for the Congress, National Airport, like many other close-in metropolitan airports, would have been closed. It is just that the Congress would never have accepted that. Of course it was funded by the Federal Government through 1987, and since that time has received appropriate grants from several Federal entities. So I believe the idea that there is not an appropriate national and Federal role here cannot be substantiated. This is one amendment--I have not seen the exact language--but that I would encourage opposition to. I see my good friend from New Jersey is on the floor to make comments. I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent I believe we have established the order of the amendments. The first was an amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or his designee regarding the commission. So the Senator's desire that that be considered first is accomplished. 
The next amendment is the one offered by the Senator from Connecticut to be followed by another amendment to be offered by Senator Daschle or his designee regarding Dulles Airport. There is then an amendment to be offered by myself, which I would at the moment not likely offer, to be followed by the amendment which has already been offered by Senator Reid dealing with the FBI building. There is a provision for a relevant amendment to be offered by the majority leader which may or may not be offered, and a similar amendment--I think that is what we have here--to be offered by the minority leader. So I believe the order has been established, and it accomplishes what the Senator from Connecticut would have preferred.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this amendment would be among those that the sponsors of S. 1575 would oppose. I want to first acknowledge that the Senator from Connecticut in offering his amendment, which is prospective, offered his support of the effort of the sponsors to redesignate Washington National as Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and that he would vote for this redesignation even though he had differences. The differences were so pronounced I can remember them, and I was a long way from the Senate at that time. 
I really believe the nature of the amendment that has just been described by the minority leader is basically a disagreement of redesignation and not so much one of the philosophical issue over local control. Of course, it isn't the Alexandria airport. It is the National Airport. Cities are constitutional instruments of States. The Governor of the State of Virginia has endorsed the redesignation of the airport which is an appropriate governing local facility. 
But, again, we could argue this forever. The level of Federal Government control of operations at Washington National is without parallel in the United States. The legislation that authorized limited local authority over Washington National contains congressional directives--appropriate landing fees, employee bargaining rights. The precise composition of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and political affiliations of its members is mandated by Congress, not constructed by State or local government. 
By statute, the Federal Government limits the length of nonstop flights to and from National Airport--National Airport, not Alexandria--to 1,250 miles. That is the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act of 1986, section 6012. There is only one other federally imposed perimeter rule in the country, in the entire United States--Love Field, TX. 
In addition, the Federal Government controls the number of slots, take off and landing rights at four `high density rule' airports: Washington National, New York LaGuardia, JFK, and Chicago O'Hare. Air carriers are limited to 37 hourly operations at Washington National; 11 hourly operations are reserved for commuter aircraft, and 12 for general aviation and business activity, all Federal mandates. 
When the Federal Government authorized the lease of Washington National and its limited governance by the Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority in 1986, it codified all of the regulations of the Metropolitan Washington Airports into Federal regulations. These Federal regulations govern airport operations such as taxicab operation, nighttime noise, and landing fees. And the Federal Government has the prerogative and authority legally and emotionally to designate the name of the National Airport. 
I could cite the specific authority, but in deference to time, and I know the Senator from Virginia has strong opinions and wants to be heard, I will not linger on this question. I do want to say that any amendment that creates a retroactive impoundment on Congress' ability to designate will be opposed by the sponsors. 
We are pleased that there is bipartisan support for this designation. I want to say, and I have mentioned it several times during the discussion, obviously there are disagreements on the contribution, but, as Senator Dodd said, there is no disagreement about the admiration the American people have for former President Ronald Reagan. To be quite candid about it, talking about the ironies, I am not sure that the naming of the most expensive building in Washington's history is exactly in concert with President Reagan. 
In conclusion, let me say that this President is wounded. He was a great American servant. He is in the sunset of his life. He is probably engaged in the most courageous battle he ever was tested for. I think sometimes extraordinary conditions and circumstances call for a spontaneous response. I am most hopeful that this legislation will be successful, and it will be successful in order to meet his 87th birthday, which is this Friday. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, once again this argument, which I just simply do not understand, suggesting that the President's family somehow has to come here and seek homage, or lobby the Congress--it is an incredible argument. That family would never do that. Anybody waiting for some communique or something of that nature--I would not hold my breath. 
As I said a moment ago, this is something the Nation has to feel it needs to do. It is a `thank you' that they need to express; our country, our citizens. There is no way that family would come here lobbying for this kind of thing. I am always surprised when it is suggested that we have not heard or something. That is disappointing. 
Mr. President, again I want to make it clear, the sponsors are going to oppose any of these amendments that change the rules retroactively, that impose some new constraint on this redesignation or some new constraint on the Congress. The concept of putting something in place prospectively may be laudable. There are several amendments here by Members on the other side who have declared they are going to vote for the redesignation but they have another issue that they are bringing forward. I think that is appropriate. But the amendments that reach backwards are not acceptable on our side. 
The argument that a local city or authority has jurisdiction here is, in my judgment, a specious argument. The Federal Government's relationship with Washington National Airport is indisputable. You cannot go to that airport without seeing the presence of it any day or any night. And the law is very clear, in terms of the Federal role in that facility. I will read the short version rather than the elongated: 
The Federal Government has a continuing but limited interest in the operation of the two federally owned airports which serve the travel and cargo needs of the entire metropolitan Washington region as well as the District of Columbia as the national seat of Government. 
As I said, municipalities are creatures of State governments and chartered by State governments and the Governor of the State of jurisdiction is in support of the redesignation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, over the last several days, there has been considerable discussion about the State of the Union Address and the general framework of the President's new budget and subsequent presentations that have been made to the Congress and to the American people about this budget. Over the next several months, we are going to entertain a lot of 
hyperbole, a lot of rhetoric, and probably a lot of finger pointing, but I have a business background--bottom line. The bottom line here is that the celebration conducted on the White House lawn last year for the first balanced budget in 30 years and the first tax relief in 16 years, if we accept the President's presentations, is being canceled. It didn't last a year. Just take an x and mark it out and take all those films and set them aside. It didn't happen, because the tax relief--the first significant tax relief in 16 years--was $110 billion over the next 5 years. The President's budget envisions tax increases of $106 billion over the next 5 years. So the tax relief is crossed through, gone. 
Now, it's true that there will be a different set of winners and losers, which is unfortunately the type of thing that happens in the Capital City. The point is, they made huge fanfare that we were giving $110 billion in tax relief. We have gone home and talked about it, and we are right back here raising it again, canceling it out. 
Now, the balanced budget--the first in 30 years--the balanced budget agreement, which was a very hard-fought battle, finally secured and signed with great celebration on the White House lawn, envisioned a cap of expenditures over 5 years. In other words, we came to terms about how much we were going to spend between the signing of that and the year 2002. Preset. We told the American people that we are on a glidepath and we have decided what we are going to spend. Well, the fruits of this have been enormous. The world has looked at us and said that this is a very positive thing. The President's budget takes that and sets it aside and says, no, we are going to go back to the days of tax and spend, and he is proposing $150 billion in new spending, added on above those caps that we agreed to. 
So, in short, bottom line, you take the budget deal and tax relief and throw it out, cancel it. That is where the debate starts this year. I think that is unacceptable. 
Mr. President, we have just been joined by my good colleague from Missouri. He is operating under a real scheduling problem here. I am going to yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Missouri. He is dealing with another matter, but we want to facilitate the Senator's schedule, and it is a very important initiative that he is going to be talking about this morning.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, first let me say this to my good friend, my distinguished colleague, the minority leader. It is incorrect to suggest that we are not talking about debate. We want to move to the bill and debate its merits, both for or against it. It is true that perhaps I, more than any other, am objecting to the concept of taking a memorial statement to a former President and turning it into a free-for-all about IRS or other issues. I just do not think that is appropriate. I can understand. And if we have a local official, a former Governor, who is opposed to it, then during the course of the debate that can be heard and people can make their judgments about whether that is correct or wrong. But I can't accept the idea of taking something in the face of the family and finding ourselves in who knows what. 
With regard to the propounding of but one amendment--and that being mine, although I know the minority leader and the majority leader have not had a chance to talk about this--but from my point of view that amendment does not need to be offered. It was an administrative attempt to be in concurrence with the House which removed it and made it Ronald Reagan National Airport. My original legislation is Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport just like it is Washington Dulles Airport. I know this is not the moment to resolve that. But the minority leader is here, and I am here, and I am passing that along. 
With regard to the minority leader's suggestion as to other amendments, of course I would not know what those are. And I hope that during the course of the afternoon or tomorrow that the minority leader and the majority leader will have a chance to come to terms on it. But I do say in the strongest way that, while we can debate whether we should or shouldn't, I do not think it is appropriate. I think it would be unseemly to the family and everybody associated to open this up where we are debating other issues--no one wants to modify IRS more than I. But I wouldn't 
do it on this bill. And that is just a point of disagreement between us. 
I agree with the Senator that it is unfortunate. I do think it is--I am the one that used the word `cynical'--I do think it is reflective of the city, that we find ourselves dealing with this effort in this way, approaching a filibuster again. I think that it speaks for what it is. 
We can debate it and vote for it or against it depending on whatever the individual Senator's desire would be, no matter their side of the aisle. I did think that the arguments--and the minority leader wasn't the source of all of those arguments--but they were, I thought, derived in an attempt to suggest a debate when in fact it was an attempt to stall or delay the legislation. 
I say to the minority leader, I am going to go on and talk a bit about this, and I do not want him to feel impounded by that in that I basically responded to his comments. 
Madam President, let me first say this legislation is awfully simple. It doesn't require some of the work such as an overhaul of the IRS or redesignation of Medicare. This is an attempt, a very appropriate attempt, to honor one of the great Presidents of our time. 
This past Friday I referred to the process as being cynical. It reminds me of just how many changes have occurred in this Capital City of ours. At first it was suggested last week that to name it Ronald Reagan National Airport was removing the name of a former President, but everybody knows that the use of the word `Washington' with regard to Washington National is referring to location, 
although I certainly, as I told the minority leader, have no problem leaving it the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. But I am doing that because I am still certifying where the airport is. It is in Washington, DC. 
It was suggested to me a little bit earlier that the Baltimore-Washington International Airport is not named after Lord Baltimore--it is named after a city called Baltimore that is named after Lord Baltimore--any more than the designation `Washington' in Baltimore-Washington International Airport refers to our first President. It refers to the two geographic locations in a very wise marketing attempt on the part of Baltimore to be an auxiliary airport to Washington National, or to the city airport here in Washington. I just do not feel that is a real nor meritorious problem in dealing with this legislation. 
Probably the most offensive of the arguments that were offered this past Friday was the argument that the Reagan family is not here asking for this to be done. What an unseemly thing to be saying, `Well, if we are going to honor former President Reagan you all have to come here, kind of crawl through the door and ask us to do this.' They will never do that. They will never do that. What are they supposed to do, launch a lobbying effort or buy some public relations firm to come up here and plead with the U.S. Senate that this would be an appropriate gesture? 
Madam President, I have already taken issue with the idea that you take a memorial, a memorial to a great American leader, and you use it as a vehicle to handle all the other processes that go on in the Capital City, whether it's IRS or Medicare or some other issue. We all know better than that. Protocol and etiquette simply dismisses that as being inappropriate, related to a memorial designation. As I said last week, this ought to stand or fall on its own merits. You either support the idea of honoring President Reagan in this way or you don't. But the idea of trying to cripple it through a series of amendments is demeaning and inappropriate. 
I frankly think this filibuster is inappropriate. It seems to become more and more of the process the other side is using. But if you had to find one area where it just was inappropriate, it would be using it in the context of a memorial statement to a former President. And I want to repeat, we are dealing with a gentleman who was a great American President, who was wounded in the twilight of his years, made one of the most magnanimous statements to his countrymen, one of the finest demonstrations of courage and bravery and ongoing public responsibility, whose birthday is this week. This town is not honoring itself in this debate--both in the context of the way this is being handled and now we find ourselves in the midst of yet another, in my judgment demeaning characteristic, and that is a filibuster. 
In an era where America yearned for a leader, Ronald Reagan answered the call. It is easy to forget that leadership is not doing what is popular based on a poll, it is doing what is right. Time and time again, President Reagan made his decisions on the strength of his convictions, regardless of current polls or popular opinion. How quickly we forget how he was mocked, chided, ridiculed when he called the Soviet Union an evil empire, but history has borne him out. 
I remember very vividly the mocking of President Reagan when he characterized the Soviet Union as an evil empire, and I remember wondering in my mind, and aloud, why in the world would anybody mock somebody for describing the Soviet Union in such a way? This was an avowed adversary that had enslaved millions of people in a dictatorship. But he was mocked when he referred to the Soviet Union as an evil empire. 
Did it deter him? Was he shaken by this? Did he call another press conference to try to explain what he meant? No. He said it was an evil empire and an avowed adversary and we ought to understand it in that way. As I said, people scoffed at his naivete when he demanded that Mikhail Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall. I can still see him standing there: `Tear down this wall.' Freedom won. The Berlin wall fell and the world is a 
completely different place because of the convictions--not only of him. He'd be the first, if he were here, to say, `I didn't do this alone.' But he was a giant in the effort. 
I remember several years ago, before his illness, he was in Atlanta, GA. It was a Republican Party event that he had agreed to attend. At the end of the meeting, in a very inspiring way, very emotional, the chairman of the dinner walked over and gave him, encased, a piece of the Berlin wall, and said, `I hope you will let this rest on your desk to remind you of the achievement your strength of convictions meant to our country and to the world.' 
Now that the wall was down--and instead of this forceful edifice of oppression that looked down on people, that enslaved people, that threatened people--it had come to the point that it was but a mere souvenir to be sitting on desks or in libraries around the world. 
Originally, the Congress that I am unfortunately dealing with here today balked at the idea that families, not Government, should decide how to spend tax dollars. Under Ronald Reagan, the families won one of the largest single tax cuts in American history. And we certainly have seen the benefit of it--millions of new jobs. The decade of the 1980s was one of unbridled optimism. As we lowered the pressure on our families, left more of the income they produced in their checking accounts, we saw an unprecedented turnaround from stagflation, from unbelievable interest rates, from high taxes; and you saw the American people come forward with almost boundless optimism. 
For some of the people in this city, they called that a decade of greed. I call it a decade of growth and strength and authority for the United States--not only in the context that we were able to stand up and force the Soviet Union to tear the wall down, but that our everyday families from Iowa to Georgia, were better off, and they were optimistic, and they regained--you know--it's `morning in America,' as he would say. And it showed. 
We were a smiling Nation again. 
Throughout his Presidency, Ronald Reagan stood on principle, and history has, again, borne him out. In 1981, the office he inherited and the country he was to govern was in grave crisis, both at home and abroad. We forget, inflation was double digits. 
What is that versus today? Several times what it is today. Interest rates were over 20 percent. It means if you wanted to buy a house, if you wanted to buy a car, you were going to pay 20 cents on the dollar just to use the money. All of you have seen the ads for automobiles today. Some are as low as 6 percent. So it was dragging our economy down. 
Ronald Reagan's most critical opponents would acknowledge that President Reagan's policies reversed our course, bringing prosperity to home and allowing us to stand tall once again abroad. 
President Reagan taught us that leadership, as I said, is more than polls and focus groups. Leadership is not doing what is popular and then trying to make it right. It is doing what is right and then making it popular. As Eric Sevareid said of Harry Truman in David McCullough's book `Truman,' `Remembering him reminds people of what a man in that office ought to be like. It's character, just character, and he stands like a rock in memory now.' 
Madam President, Ronald Reagan is a rock of our time, and history is going to demonstrate that again and again. 
The Wall Street Journal of Monday, January 5, 1998, talks about Ronald Reagan. `Reagan National Airport' is the headline. I am going to share it with the Senate:  
The Republican Governors Association has unanimously endorsed renaming Washington's chief transportation gateway the `Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.' 
I might add, that includes the current Governor of Virginia, not a former Governor, the current Governor. 
The move gives impetus to a plan by Congressional leaders to pass legislation honoring the former President in time for his 87th birthday on February 6. 
This week, which is what is so frustrating about this filibuster. We are running on a short fuse here, Madam President. 
A big booster of the idea is Governor George Allen of Virginia, where National Airport is located. 
Of course, he is now retired from that governorship. 
He notes that many airports are named after famous people, from San Diego's Lindbergh to New York's LaGuardia, Chicago's O'Hare, Washington's Dulles Airport and Orange County's John Wayne Airport. A serious effort is under way to rename Los Angeles' airport after actor and World War II aviator Jimmy Stewart. The late President John F. Kennedy was honored by having the nation's largest international airport named after him in 1964. 
Friends of Mr. Reagan say National Airport is a more appropriate memorial than the new $818 million government office building in Washington that is also named after him. 
I know this to be the case. Washington National is a symbol. It is something that millions of passengers see every year, both domestic and foreign. Those of us who share my view think that is the appropriate memorial to designate Ronald Reagan Airport. 
To have him identified with [this building]-- 
And I am going to modify this language, I don't want to read it exactly--`represents everything he was opposed to, is the ultimate irony.' 
That is the big building. 
`He wanted to pare back government,' says former Senator Paul Laxalt. In contrast, renaming National Airport would cost almost nothing. 
Now we know it costs nothing because we have had letters from people willing to pay for any changes, citizens who are willing to step forward. 
`You're talking about a few signs and a logo,' says David Ralston, chairman of the airport's authority. Grover Norquist, who came up with the idea as head of the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project, says he will be happy to raise money to pay for any extra costs if Democrats find that a reason to object. 
We have already put that to bed. We have another citizen who already stepped forward who said he would see to any financial costs associated with renaming the airport. 
A few already are grouching privately. While President Clinton has declined to say if he would sign the name change into law, some Democrats in Congress mutter that Mr. Reagan is an inappropriate choice. Washington, D.C.'s Mayor Marion Barry says `a host of other people' should be considered. 
As I have said, if they believe that this memorial is inappropriate, they should speak to it and vote against it. But using specious arguments to somehow cloud the effort I do not think is appropriate. 
But the first frontal assault on the idea came from Mary McGrory, the Washington Post's venerable liberal columnist. She says the idea `should be nipped in the bud.' 
She must have some influence here. 
Mr. Reagan `didn't only rail against Washington, he genuinely despised it. . .' 
I have to say that is just such an inappropriate characterization of our former President. He didn't like a lot of the ideas. He didn't like the idea that this town thought it ran America, but he did love America, and he was a believer in its optimism and its glory and understood that this was the capital of the free world for which he gave so much of his life to protect. 
She says: 
He took no part in its revels or its problems. He was in no way attached to it. 
I think most Americans would find not being attached to the Capital City an attribute. If I have one criticism of the city in the brief time I have been here, it is that too many people succumb to this city and the idea that it dominates the Nation. 
She concludes by saying `we do not know what Ronald Reagan feels about all this. He is not himself.' 
That is accurate. He has fallen ill, as we all know. 
That may be true, but Nancy Reagan and Mr. Reagan's son Michael are on record as supporting the idea. Governor Allen says a Reagan Airport would gladden the hearts of millions of Americans who don't view Washington as an imperial city. 
It is true that President Reagan did not view this as an imperial city. 
He says generations of future lawmakers would do well to remember Mr. Reagan as they fly in to pass laws. `Every time they come here, they'll be reminded they're here to serve the people, even though they're far from home,' Governor Allen says. 
Nothing can restore Ronald Reagan to the inspirational vitality that so inspired Americans during the 1980s, qualities that are vividly recalled in the superb PBS biography of Mr. Reagan that will air nationally on February 23 and 24. 
Still, we can't help but think the country would benefit from having such a visible national symbol honoring him. 
Great last line: 
Name this one for the Gipper. 
Madam President, I have alluded several times here this afternoon to the fact that our former President has been afflicted with a crippling illness. President Reagan faced personal adversity many times during his Presidency. Being cut down by an assassin's bullet would have been enough to knock the wind out of almost anybody, but not President Reagan. I remember this incident so vividly. I think most Americans would. 
I happened to be in London that afternoon. Nancy and I were having dinner. It is very interesting. The waiter came over, and he leaned over, and he said, `Pardon me. Are you Americans?' 
I guess we must have looked a little different to him or maybe it was the southern accent. I am not sure. But he said, `Are you Americans?' And I said, `Yes, we are. Thank you.' And in the most somber way, he leaned over and he said that he was so sorry to advise me that, `Your President has been shot.' He was just stunned. And he said, `We would like to help you, so we have arranged for a television in our living quarters upstairs, if you might like to understand what has happened.' We immediately dashed upstairs. 
We shared the shock of everyone in the world wondering at that moment, had we lost this great President. And where was the Vice President? And what was actually happening? But even in that moment you could sense the world's admiration, even in this waiter, even in this community, this restaurant, their admiration for President Reagan, and trying to help the only Americans that were right there in front of them to see them through this situation. 
Or do you remember when he was diagnosed with cancer? He bounced back again. Couldn't take the Gipper down. 
But now he faces his greatest battle--Alzheimer's disease. And he has not shrunk from the challenge. Ronald Reagan chose to use his personal suffering to bring public focus on the devastation caused by this disease, and in so doing once again took the cards he was given and turned them to another public use. 
Last Thursday, Madam President, I shared the unbelievable letter that President Reagan wrote to his fellow countrymen and to the world, for that matter. I am going to share that again this afternoon because it is not long. And I think it speaks to the nature of the individual we are trying to honor on his 87th birthday. 
He said, on November 5, 1994--not that long ago:  
My fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. 
Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way. In the past, Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result, many more people underwent testing. They were treated in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives. 
So now we feel it is important to share it with you. In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it. 
At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this Earth doing the things I have always done. I will continue to share life's journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters. 
Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, the family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage. 
In closing, let me thank you, the American people, for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your President. When the Lord calls me home, whenever that day may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future. 
I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead. 
Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you. 
Sincerely, Ronald Reagan. 
Every time I read this I am just struck, as I was with the assassination attempt, with the bout with cancer. I remember when he was first running for President--he had been an actor --and there was no way he possessed the qualifications to be President. And then, of course, he was too old. I think this President defied about everything they could put in front of him. And he turned out to be one of the truly great American Presidents of this century and for all time. 
I know that if we are able to accomplish this, and can do so by his birthday this week, we will have made but a small gesture to acknowledge our gratitude for an enormous career and an America for which all time--all time--will be changed, for which millions of people are now free that were not, for thousands upon thousands of men and women in our military and others who did not have to lift up their arms to accomplish the transformation in Europe. 
Many of those people probably do not realize how much they are indebted to this great President. Wouldn't it be nice to remind them, and wouldn't it be nice for them to understand, through this gesture, what a great leader can mean to the Nation, our country and our future? 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, one of President Reagan's most ardent supporters, if not the most ardent, oddly enough, is not an American citizen. A moment ago I was talking about an individual--I wish I kept this person's name--that was a British citizen. Oddly enough, it was this individual's Prime Minister who is probably President Reagan's most ardent supporter, Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of Britain, 1979 to 1990. 
Recently, a book has been published of vignettes and remembrances of Ronald Reagan. There is a short one from Margaret Thatcher that I will share with the Senate. 
I . . . met Governor Reagan shortly after my becoming conservative leader in 1975. Even before then I knew about Governor Reagan because Denis [her husband] had returned home one evening in the late 1960s full of praise for a remarkable speech Ronald Reagan had just delivered to the Institute of Directors.. I read the text myself and quickly saw what Denis meant. When we met in person [she is talking about meeting Governor Reagan] . . . I was immediately won over by his charm, sense of humor, and directness. 
These are all very important characteristics of President Reagan. Charm. The other side all referred to him as Teflon. Sense of humor. It was absolutely captivating to be in his presence because he could so effectively use humor to calm things down, to take the sting out of a confrontation, to move people back to the table. He was the best at using his sense of humor. And then the directness. Directness. 
Years ago when he was first running for President, in 1976, I was summoned to a meeting at Atlanta International Airport which is named for Hartsfield, one of our distinguished former mayors. The Governor was going to visit with us. He was reaching out and trying to meet Republicans everywhere. We didn't have many in Georgia at that time, but a few of us gathered together, and he came in the room. I tended to support our sitting President, President Gerald Ford. I thought it made sense the party should stick with the incumbent President. The Governor was making a case for himself. 
I asked the very last question. I asked the Governor, `Now, look, if we are going to be in such a tough election, why does it make sense to replace a sitting incumbent with all the assets that that person can bring to the contest?' And that threw Governor Reagan a bit, threw him off. So then the person stood up and said, `Well, that concludes our meeting,' and without a heartbeat, Governor Reagan said, `We are not ending this meeting on that question,' and he took another question that was on a more optimistic note and completely turned the meeting around. His directness and his ability to take charge in any setting was remarkable. 
In the succeeding years I read his speeches, advocating tax cuts as the root to wealth creation and stronger defenses as an alternative to detente. I also read many of his radio broadcasts which his press secretary sent over regularly for me. I agreed with them all. In November 1978 we met again in my room in the House of Commons. 
In the early years Ronald Reagan had been dismissed by much of the American political elite though not by the American electorate. . . [they considered him] a right-wing maverick who could not be taken seriously. Now he was seen by many thoughtful Republicans as their best ticket back to the White House. Whatever Ronald Reagan had gained in experience, he had not done so at the expense of his beliefs. I found him stronger than ever. When he left my study, I reflected on how different things might look if such a man were President of the United States. But, in November 1978, such a prospect seemed a long way off. 
The so-called Reagan Doctrine, which Ronald Reagan developed in his speech to both Houses of Parliament in 1982, demonstrated just how potent a weapon in international politics human rights can be. His view was that we should fight the battle of ideas for freedom against communism through the world, and refuse to accept the permanent exclusion of the captive nations from the benefits of freedom. 
This unashamedly philosophical approach and the armed strength supporting it transformed the political world. President Reagan undermined the Soviet Union at home by giving hope to its citizens, directly assisted rebellions against illegitimate Communist regimes in Afghanistan and Nicaragua [in our own hemisphere] and facilitated the peaceful transition to democracy in Latin American countries and the Philippines. Of course, previous American governments had extolled human rights, and President Carter had even declared that they were the `soul' of U.S. foreign policy. Where President Reagan went beyond these, however, was in making the Soviets the principal targets of his human rights campaign, and moving from rhetorical to material support for anti-Communist guerrillas in countries where Communist regimes had not securely established themselves. The result was a decisive advance for freedom in the world . . . In this instance, human rights and wider American purposes were in complete harmony. 
Madam President, I will read a letter to the Senate. January 2, 1998.  
Gentlemen: I endorse and support H.R. 2625 and S. 1297. Both would redesignate Washington National Airport as `Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.' 
Sincerely, Gerald R. Ford.  
Madam President, this next Friday, February 6, as President Reagan likes to put it, will be the 48th anniversary of his 39th birthday. 
We have been blessed to have had such a great leader, dedicated to principle. Ronald Reagan distinguished himself in several careers in his lifetime. He was a radio sportscaster, announcing Cubs games for WHO in Des Moines, IA; an actor in films, such as `Knute Rockne, All-American;' a union leader--head of the Screen Actors Guild; a two-term Governor of California; and a twice-elected President of the United States. 
So today, Madam President, I say to my colleagues, let's pass this one for the Gipper. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would like to commend Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany, Ga., for being named one of five national 1998 American Hospital Association (AHA) NOVA Award winners. The award recognizes innovative AHA member hospitals for their outstanding progress toward restructuring the health care system with a focus on community health. 
Phoebe Putney, the largest hospital in southwest Georgia, is being honored for its Network of Trust program for pregnant and parenting teens. The program was established in 1994 through a community collaborative, in partnership with Phoebe and the school system, to address the teen pregnancy problem in Albany/Dougherty County. The goals of the program are to (1) promote healthy mothers and babies; (2) decrease child neglect and teen drug abuse; (3) increase self-esteem and; (4) prevent school dropouts. 
In 1994, the rate of birth to teens in the U.S. was 59 per 1,000; the rate in Georgia was 72 per 1,000; and in Albany/Dougherty County, the rate was 91 per 1,000. More than 400 babies were born to teenagers at Phoebe in 1994, with 18 percent of those babies requiring treatment in the high risk nursery and 25 percent of the mothers delivering for the second or third time. 
Network of Trust is based on the concept of teens as peer counselors. The program is implemented in the school system in three phases. Phase I involves early identification to offer prenatal care and education on-site at the school. This is designed to reduce school dropout rates, build self esteem, promote parenting skills, reduce fears related to childbirth and teach anger management. 
Phase II targets teen mothers after delivery to discourage repeat pregnancies. Mothers are encouraged to maintain competitive grades and are provided training to alleviate parental frustrations that often lead to child abuse. Phase II teen mothers also act as mentors to Phase I pregnant teens. 
Phase III offers a summer internship at Phoebe Putney Memorial for selected Phase II participants to enhance self-esteem and decision-making skills. Interns are matched with hospital staff mentors and the participants are encouraged to pursue future education, with an educational stipend given to each teen that successfully completes Phase III. 
Network of Trust also includes a component for teen fathers with weekly classes taught by instructors with special training and school counselors. Students utilize infant simulator dolls that are computerized to record the type of treatment they receive from their `parents.' 
The program's immense success can be measured in many ways. Participation has increased steadily each year, with 38 students participating in the 1994-95 school year, 241 in the 1995-96 school year, and approximately 273 students in the 1996-97 school year. 
The program has also greatly reduced the number of repeat pregnancies. In 1994, 22 percent of births to teens in the U.S. were repeat pregnancies. Of the 38 participants in the Network of Trust in 1994, there were only two repeat pregnancies, or 5 percent. In 1995-96, only 3 percent of participants had repeat pregnancies. And in 1996-97, there were only 1.5 percent repeat pregnancies. 
The high school dropout rate decreased significantly. In 1994, the dropout rate for Dougherty County was 45 percent. In 1995-96, only 8 percent of the participants dropped out of school and, in 1996-97, just 1.4 percent. 
Also, for the first time in the 90s, the number of low birth weight babies born in Dougherty County dropped. The economic impact of the students who graduated from high school produces an additional $830,000 in anticipated income for those students as workers. 
Phoebe will receive the AHA NOVA Award on Monday, Feb. 2, in Washington as part of the AHA's Annual Membership Meeting. I respectively ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital on this important achievement in improving Georgia's community health.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I see there are some other speakers. I have some extended remarks, but I will be brief now in deference to other people if they have a comment to make. But Mr. President, this is the definition of `pettiness.' This is demeaning. The concept that we would honor a former President, but we have to extract a price. 
A memorandum went out to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that wanted an IRS reformation amendment tacked to this legislation. The idea that `You can have this memorial, but only if we extract something from it, too.' Maybe this is an indication of just how cynical this city has become from top to bottom. 
I have great respect for the minority leader. I consider him a very good friend. But who would counsel him to suggest `We haven't heard from the Reagan family'? What are they supposed to do, buy tickets and fly over here and lobby outside the Chamber? Is that what you would ask of them to do? 
The other gentlemen on the list that I have heard that you perhaps would choose to honor, so be it. Honor them. Come forward with these ideas, but not as a quid pro quo to a memorial to this former President. 
Do you remember the memorial to the late President Franklin Roosevelt? Was there some skirmish over there? Did there have to be some ratification or some affidavit from their family as to whether or not it ought to be built and how? I, like Senator McCain, would not have been able to envision that we would be discussing Ronald Reagan in this manner. 
Are we removing the name of the airport? Has their family appropriately petitioned this Congress that only awards things to those that are on their knees asking? 
Can there not be an acceptance of fact that we are dealing with a great American figure who is wounded--who is wounded--who is near the end? And here we are piddling around with, was it named after the President or after the city or have we heard from them, the family, and how much will it cost, when everybody knows it is minimal? 
The only word that characterizes it is `demeaning.' 
Mr. President, I will ask for time later on, but I yield the floor in deference to my colleague from New York.

Are we really getting into a discussion about changing the name of the Washington, DC, airport? We are going to invoke all this intellectual analysis of how that building was built. I mean, that is not what was being sent to us all morning long. 
We were not arguing over, you know, the dynamics of the process, whether or not we are going to name another building. I do not object to you all naming another building for somebody that you want to honor, but it ought to be done on its own. This should not be held up in this manner as a negotiating tool. And that is what has been going on all day. 
Is the Senator aware of that?

Mr. COVERDELL. I accept the statement of the Senator. 
Unfortunately, during the course of the last several hours, this has turned into a quid pro quo. From my own view, I would rather that it not be accepted than we get into, `Well, we will do this if you do that,' and we will name this that and this something else. I can only speak for myself. That is my view of it. 
I mentioned a little earlier, Mr. President, that there are some unique circumstances that we are confronting in this particular case with former President Reagan. I have been going through some of his legacy of late, and I will share one of the most profound letters an American leader has ever written to his country. It came to us on November 5, 1994.  
My fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. 
Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way. In the past, Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result, many more people underwent testing. There were treated in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives. 
So now we feel it is important to share it with you. In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it. 
At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the remainder of the years God gives me on this Earth doing the things I have always done. I will continue to share life's journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and supporters. 
Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, the family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will face it with faith and courage. 
In closing, let me thank you, the American people, for giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your president. When the Lord calls me home, whenever that day may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future. 
I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead. 
Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you. 
Sincerely, Ronald Reagan.  
Now, Ronald Reagan's birthday is next February 6, and we ought to do this. This ought to be a part of the sunset journey. 
I again say, it is absolutely beyond comprehension that a suggestion was made here this afternoon that somehow his family ought to have been more pronounced and more explicit about their desires with regard to this legislation. To have done so would have been entirely--I repeat, entirely--uncharacteristic for the man that wrote this letter to do. Nor would he in any way have condoned any member of his family making such a suggestion. The only way that something like this could happen on the eve of these final moments would be for it to be a spontaneous gesture from the American people. 
So, Mr. President, just for clarity, you never know what will happen in an institution like this, but again I would be prouder that this legislation suffered a defeat over the nuances from the other side than for there to be an asterisk on the legislation that suggested the only way that this body and this Congress could reach out at this moment was if we made some tradeoff; there have been others that got a little something here or there, like you do every day in this town. My own view is it would be diminishing and demeaning of what is being attempted and endeavored to be done here today in the name of a great American President, among others. But this one was a great American President who, as I said earlier, is wounded. 
There are moments in our lives and in the history of our country that require a spontaneous response and not some methodical appointing of a commission to measure and weigh every balance. Thank heavens nature doesn't function that way. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, to the subject that we have been debating, which is legislation to rename Washington National Airport `Ronald Reagan National Airport,' we have had quite a discussion here this afternoon. As I said a little earlier, I have been going through, during the course of this exercise, the various things, of course, that have been said about our former President. I got to thinking, well, who knows him best? And, of course, that is the former First Lady, Nancy Reagan. I was reminded that I had the opportunity to hear her in one of the most heartfelt speeches I believe I have ever heard in San Diego at the national convention in that beautiful city. It was quite a task that she had to perform, to come forward before the Nation, given the situation that the Reagans had been facing, and try to bring a message to those gathered and to the American people. 
I think this is an appropriate time to revisit what she said about her husband, President Reagan, at that time. I will skip the introduction, the acknowledgement of the crowd, and move to the heart of the speech, which was undoubtedly difficult for her to deal with because she was moving to the moment in which she felt she had the responsibility to convey to the Nation a feeling about her husband's Presidency and her husband's views of America. 
She said this: 
Just 4 years ago, Ronnie stood before you and spoke for what he said might be his last speech at a Republican Convention. Sadly, his words were too prophetic. When we learned of his illness, Alzheimer's, he made the decision to write his letter to the American people. 
This is the letter I read a moment ago from the President himself. 
She says: 
And the people responded, as they always do. I can't tell you what your cards and letters have meant to both of us. The love and affection from thousands of Americans has been, and continues to be, a strengthening force for Ronnie and me each and every day. 
I want to reread that sentence because the other side has evoked that there is some family responsibility here that they should have fulfilled as a precedent before moving for congressional action on this, which as I have said repeatedly is just beyond my understanding. But I will read for them what she said to America: 
I cannot tell you what your cards and letters have meant to both of us. The love and affection from thousands of Americans has been, and continues to be, a strengthening force for Ronnie and me each and every day. 
In other words, it was a source of encouragement and strength for them at that time to hear from our fellow countrymen about his work. That's what that means. 
We have learned, as too many other families have learned, of the terrible pain and the loneliness that must be endured as each day brings another reminder of this very long goodbye. But Ronnie's spirit, his optimism, his never-failing belief in the strength and goodness of America is still very strong. If he were able to be here tonight, he would once again remind us of the power of each individual-- 
How many times had we heard that from President Reagan, about the power of each American? 
Urging us once again to fly as high as our wings will take us and to never give up on America. 
The majority leader was here earlier and was talking about Margaret Thatcher and what she had said about the former President. I might revisit that in just a little bit. But that's the point that Margaret Thatcher always focused on--the never give up on America or never give up on Western civilization, and what she so admired in the former President. Here it is documented by Nancy Reagan when she said. 
. . . remind us of the power of each individual, urging us once again to fly as high as our wings will take us and to never give up on America. I can tell you with certainty that he still sees the `shining city on a hill,' a place full of hope and a promise for us all. 
As you all know, I am not the speechmaker in the family. So let me close with Ronnie's words, not mine. In that last speech 4 years ago, he said, `Whatever else history may say about me when I am gone, I hope it will report that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts, and may all of you as Americans never forget your heroic origins, never fail to seek divine guidance, and never, never lose your natural God-given optimism.' 
Ronnie's optimism, like America's, still shines very brightly. May God bless him and, from both of us, God bless America. 
You know, several weeks ago, I was in a discussion about American liberty.  
I was talking about the fact that free people behave completely differently than people who are not free or oppressed. One of the key components of a free people is their optimism--optimism, the belief that they can accomplish, the belief that they can build, the belief that they cannot be vanquished. And there is no American in contemporary history who so fueled and energized that key component of American liberty as did President Ronald Reagan. He was the epitome of optimism. 
I see we have just be joined by my good friend and colleague and neighbor, the Senator from Alabama, and in deference to his time I am going to withhold these other remarks for a moment. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is interesting to hear the good Senator from Alabama, and I appreciate the personal experience he had confronting these people that were being made free for the first time. 
I had the opportunity to do that as well. I will never forget the faces of those people who had never been free or had not been for so long they couldn't remember. If you will bear with me one second, I am going to yield. One afternoon I was in Soviet Bulgaria. It was on the eve of this epic realignment of all Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. I decided to break away, and I did and walked about 5 miles back through the neighborhoods. Do you know what struck me? This is before the freedom had hit. I never saw a single adult ever smile. Never, not one, not one person smiled because of the weight of the oppression. Fortunately, the children were smiling. So you could say, `There is hope here.' But it had been beaten out of them--the natural nature of human mind. 
The man that brought the wall down--the Senator from Alabama said it and we will never be able to say it enough--how many people he freed through that show of force. He didn't do it alone. He would be the first one to say so. In fact, he would deny it. He would put somebody else far ahead of him in terms of having created that freedom. But when you walk through those streets today and you talk to those people and in all of those countries, they know the force of President Ronald Reagan and they know when he said, `Gorbachev, you tear this wall down' that that was not just rhetoric. That wall came down. 
I yield to the Senator from Alabama.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, of course, during the course of the afternoon we have been talking about very personal praise for his family and the First Lady. But for Ronald Reagan there is a lot of unlikely praise that needs to be acknowledged here today from Republicans and Democrats alike. While my friends on the other side of the aisle may disagree with him on certain policies, I hope they will agree that he stood fast on conviction and provided leadership for America at a very critical time. Ronald Reagan did after all begin his career as a Democrat. He truly was a man of both sides of the aisle. He cast his first vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose name has been evoked in this debate because when we were talking about the need to have an appropriate not designation but memorial for President Roosevelt, we did not enter into any of this kind of bickering. It was done. It should be done. Now citizens from all across the country can be reminded of that era of our Nation's history. 
Here are some words of tribute from some unlikely sources. 
Former California Governor and Presidential candidate, Jerry Brown, said, `He was not just the guy across the table. He had a presence. He had the quality of being able to tell a story. . .' And, as Senator Sessions just said, ` . . . and then smile and laugh. There was a sort of magic there, and I could see it at work.' 
Or former majority whip of the House, Representative Coehlo, `Ronald Reagan believed a few things and he really stood for them. He was Presidential. He did not get down in the gutter.' 
I want to repeat that. `He did not get down in the gutter. Indeed, he would let people accuse him of anything. We did. But these things never got a response.' 
Even Sam Donaldson has good things to say about President Reagan. He said, `I don't think we have ever had a President who used the bully pulpit better than he did. He was its master. Reagan's most outstanding leadership quality was that you knew where he stood on a matter. You didn't have to agree with him. He got into some of the most contentious issues for our country. I never had to figure out what kind of a speech he would give tomorrow or worry that he would change his mind from the views he expressed today.' 
That is Sam Donaldson talking about Ronald Reagan. 
Donaldson, further quoting, `Reagan is the most dynamic President I have seen.' 
So, as I said, whether you agreed with him or not, Ronald Reagan defined leadership in our time. 
Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I think Senator Hutchinson is here from Arkansas. I will determine whether that is so.

Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Arkansas was here yesterday and gave a very inspiring commentary on his legislation to improve American education, but he has matched yesterday. Those were remarkable words, and the personal feeling in connection with the former President is obvious. I watched the same speech and remember just being stunned by it. I didn't really know that much about him, but I remember turning to my mother and saying, `You ought to have heard that speech.' Anybody who heard it I think was moved by it. But I really do believe the Senator has captured his optimism, and I commend the Senator for it. 
Mr. President, we have been joined by my good colleague from Nevada, who has other matters to talk about. I am going to yield the floor so that he might proceed with his piece of business.

Mr. COVERDELL. In the original legislation it's the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The House removed the `Washington'--Ronald Reagan National Airport. My amendment was simply in conjunction with that. Yes, just to make it absolutely clear, the original concept of the sponsor was that it was the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. If that needed any further clarification, I wanted to add it.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for returning to the floor, for reading this very emotional letter. You know, in a sense the remarks that we have heard here this afternoon all have this common thread of admiration running through them, such as is expressed in this letter, almost as if there is--just during that period of time there was a connection between this man and his call for optimism, his belief in the country. And it evokes these kinds of emotions that were just expressed to us by Senator McCain. 
I appreciate the Senator's, in a sense, admonition that if there is some common ground here, that would be useful to pursue. At this point, in my view, a statement like this about a figure such as President Reagan stands on its own. That takes nothing away from anyone else or other heroes and heroines. But, if the other side has a goal or something of this nature, I am sure they would find many Republicans who would join with them in honoring that person. We have. 
I mention my good friend and colleague from my own State for whom we have named a very prominent new courthouse. I mentioned the Roosevelt Memorial and others. This has not been, as Senator McCain indicated, a very good way to begin this session of the Congress. 
He has mentioned cost. He has mentioned this article that we are renaming an airport that was named for George Washington. That is not the case. These are roadblocks, and they can only be viewed as an attempt to either throttle the legislation or to extract something from it, which I think diminishes what we are trying to do here. 
The suggestion that we are naming a building downtown and that somehow that is all that needs to be done to honor this man--if you go to Eastern Europe and ask the people if that is enough, they would tell you in a hurry, no. 
It is surprising to me that, given all that historical period, fewer than a dozen landmarks in our country are dedicated to Ronald Reagan. Fewer than a dozen. Because of President Reagan's enduring legacy and the American people's continuing respect and affection for him, it is fitting that the national airport bear his name for all those who come here, all those from our own country and all those who visit our country. This is a fitting acknowledgment of a massive role in American history. 
Many airports are named after famous people. From San Diego's Lindbergh to New York's LaGuardia, Chicago's O'Hare, Washington's Dulles. I might point out that often we refer to it as Washington Dulles Airport. If you look at the little marker for arrivals and destinations, it doesn't just say `D,' it alludes to the city, Dulles Washington. It is not because of George Washington, but because of the Capital City. 
The airport is named after former Secretary of State Dulles. 
Orange County's John Wayne; and currently there is an effort underway to rename the Los Angeles airport after actor and World War II aviator Jimmy Stewart. President John F. Kennedy was honored by having the Nation's largest international airport named after him in 1964. Sponsors contend that no American statesman of this century deserve this honor more than former President Reagan, our Nation's 40th President. The Reagan era, fondly remembered by tens of millions of Americans, marked the turning point in America's declining fortunes after our defeat in Vietnam and the oil crisis of the seventies. 
Buoyed by the contagious optimism of what they call `the Great Communicator'--I never really bought into that term. I accept it, but I always thought some of the people who communicated it were taken aback by his ability to overpower them through his communications, and they would write it off that he is just a great communicator. As history bore out, he was a great leader who had the skill of communicating--Americans were reawakened to their image of themselves and to a great people with a great future. The far-reaching Reagan tax cuts ignited what remains the longest post-World War II economic recovery, a sharp reversal from stagflation of the high tax, high inflation seventies. How quickly we forget the millions and millions and millions of people who secured economic independence because of the economic boom that he unleashed by the argument that if we lower the tax burden on the American people, they will respond with entrepreneurship and hard work, and it will make America strong again. And that is exactly what they did. 
His restoration of America's neglected defenses--of course, the Persian Gulf war was led by President George Bush, but I am sure that former President Bush, my good friend, would acknowledge that he had the tools to use that were prepared for by his predecessor for whom he served as Vice President, President Ronald Reagan, the buildup that occurred that allowed us to so successfully vanquish Saddam Hussein. 
His restoration of America's neglected defenses, combined with his forceful and eloquent advocacy of American values against the failed ideology of communism, epitomized by his demand in Berlin, `Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,' set the stage for the collapse of the evil empire. 
How many of us remember the ridicule when he came up with SDI and how fearful it made the Soviet Union, probably one of the single greatest strokes to bring down what he characterized as the evil empire? 
According to Russian sources, the technological challenge of the Strategic Defense Initiative, as I just referred to, SDI, envisioned by President Reagan to defend the American people from nuclear attack forced the Soviet regime to adopt policies, like glasnost and perestroika, in a vain attempt to keep up, and 
instead unleashed the social forces that brought down the system built by Lenin and Stalin. 
In short, President Reagan's commitment to restoring the fundamental ideals of the Founding Fathers and the traditional beliefs of the American people to the helm of American national policy at home and abroad marks him as one of America's greatest leaders and a central figure of the 20th century. 
Mr. President, throughout the day, as this debate has progressed, beginning with Majority Leader Lott, who quoted former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her genuine deep-felt respect for President Reagan, I want to read--there was recently a book published where they had world figures comment on President Reagan's Presidency. It would, of course, been incomplete without a statement from Margaret Thatcher. She says:  
I . . . met Governor Reagan shortly after my becoming Conservative leader in 1975. 
This is long before she was Prime Minister and long before Governor Reagan had been elected President, 5 years. 
Even before then, I knew something about him because Denis-- 
Her husband-- had returned home one evening in the late 1960s full of praise for a remarkable speech Ronald Reagan had just delivered to the Institute of Directors. I read the text myself and quickly saw what Denis meant. When we met in person, I was immediately won over by his charm, sense of humour-- 
We have heard references all day long to that disarming sense of humor and the ability to communicate by that disarming smile. 
. . . I was immediately won over by his charm, sense of humour and directness. 
Firmness. 
In the succeeding years I read his speeches, advocating tax cuts as the root to wealth creation and stronger defenses as an alternative to detente. 
You see, SDI, which we have just heard from Russian authorities broke their back, was not detente. That is not saying we both can obliterate each other. We are saying we are going to protect ourselves from you and we consider yours to be an evil force and we won't accept it. Look how different the world is. 
Remember when they met in a summit and the Russians were endeavoring to do SDI in, and it had been built up. He was under enormous pressure to come to an agreement. But when he realized he could not have the agreement, President Reagan, without undoing this new tool to defend the country, said, `I'm leaving.' Because despite the embarrassment that might have been to have left without anything productive, the principle outweighed his own fortunes, and he was ready to get on a plane and fly home, having failed but having kept his commitment. That is what she is alluding to here. 
In the succeeding years I read his speeches, advocating tax cuts as the root of wealth . . . I also read many of his . . . [radio] broadcasts. . .which his Press Secretary sent over regularly for me. I agreed with them all. In November 1978 we met again in my room in the House of Commons. 
In the early years Ronald Reagan had been dismissed by much of the American political elite-- 
Which, I might add, is probably the reason I read a moment ago that there are fewer than a dozen landmarks to this great American figure--fewer than a dozen. I think we are still dealing with America's political elite. 
. . . though [Ronald Reagan was] not [dismissed] by the American electorate, [the political elite saw him] as a right-wing maverick who could not be taken seriously. Now he was seen by many thoughtful Republicans as their best ticket back to the White House. Whatever Ronald Reagan had gained in experience, he had not done so at the expense of his beliefs-- 
Taking you back to the meeting he had with the Russians over SDI. His beliefs were more important to him than his political fortunes, returning without an agreement. 
Of course, at the end, as you know, he got the agreement. 
I found [his beliefs] stronger than ever. When he left my study, I reflected on how different things might look if such a man [Ronald Reagan] were President of the United States. But, in November 1978, such a prospect seemed a long way off. 
The so-called Reagan Doctrine, which Ronald Reagan developed in a speech to both Houses of Parliament in 1982, demonstrated just how potent a weapon in international politics human rights could be. His view was that we should fight the battle of ideas for freedom against communism throughout the world, and refuse to accept the permanent exclusion of the captive nations from the benefits of freedom. 
Ronald Reagan understood that America's glory was founded in freedom. And he wanted all the world to be able to enjoy these same benefits.  
This unashamedly philosophical approach and the armed strength supporting it transformed the political world. President Reagan undermined the Soviet Union at home by giving hope to its citizens, directly assisted rebellions against illegitimate Communist regimes in Afghanistan and Nicaragua, and facilitated the peaceful transition to democracy in Latin American countries and the Philippines. Of course, previous American Governments had extolled human rights, and President Carter had even declared that they were the `soul' of U.S. foreign policy. Where President Reagan went beyond [he went beyond] these, however, was in making the Soviets the principal target of his human rights campaign, and in moving from rhetorical to material support for anti-Communist guerrillas in countries where Communist regimes had not securely established themselves. The result [the result] was a decisive advance for freedom in the world . . .. In this instance, human rights and wider American purposes were in complete harmony. 
And yet here we are at 4:15 in January 1998, in the twilight of his years, and we are in an argument over whether we ought to name the Nation's Capital airport for him. 
How nice it would be if all these new people from Nicaragua to Poland, from East Germany to Afghanistan could have a presence here this afternoon. And we could ask them, `Do you think we ought to name this National Airport for this man of freedom?' I think the resounding ovation would be so loud as to have been heard around the world. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Minnesota for his very fitting and gracious remarks. 
I think Senator McCain of Arizona has properly framed a certain sadness about this afternoon. This is a surprising way to start this new session of Congress with the other side constructing roadblocks in front of this type of legislation or trying to exact a quid pro quo, `Well, you can name this if we name that,' as we approach, as he calls it, the sunset of his life. He has a birthday next month. 
While you might not have always agreed with him, it is clear that former President Reagan was a giant in our time, a giant on the world stage. If you are going to fight him even at this moment, don't do it by minimalist activity, don't do it by some nuance argument over whether or not the name `Washington' is for the city or for former President George Washington. Don't fight an epic world figure by disputing whether or not it will take $60,000 to repaint the signs. What a classic disconnect. Don't do it by saying, `There is another building downtown that has his name on it, isn't that enough?' 
I frankly think the former President would feel as Maggie Thatcher suggested, complimented, if you just said we don't want to do it; we just don't want to do that--rather than all these minimalist, ineffective, of absolutely nonequal standing diminutive assertions. It is OK to disagree about doing it or not, but don't do it in this way. Let's at least have respect.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, last night President Clinton delivered some good news and some bad news for those who, like me, want to address the crisis in American education. And Madam President, that crisis exists in grades kindergarten through high school. I repeat, kindergarten through high school. The good news is that President Clinton has finally joined the Republicans in recognizing that we must address this crisis. 
It is bad enough that our Nation's schoolchildren have to run a gauntlet of drugs and violence just to sit in class, but when they get to the classroom they are not learning the basics. Just recently, a study published in Education Week showed that only 4 in 10 urban school students could master basic math and reading skills. Four in 10. It does not get much better when we move to the suburban schools. There it is only 6 in 10 who can master these basic skills when tested. 
Madam President, we are failing our students, and we clearly are not preparing America for the new century that the President spoke of last evening. Republicans first attacked this problem with a comprehensive proposal over 1 year ago, S. 1, that addressed how to help children in unsafe schools, how to increase literacy, and how to give new authority to parents and communities to improve their local schools. 
Regrettably, although we were able to reach common ground on making college more accessible and affordable, President Clinton fought real education reform for the kindergarten through high school grades every step of the way. 
Most notably and unforgettably, he threatened to veto the entire tax relief bill last year unless we dropped one single provision, one that provided education savings accounts to parents for use for their child's specific educational needs. 
Madam President, if there was ever a proposal that was win-win in this city, the education savings account was it. The President said he would veto the entire tax relief proposal if that remained. The bad news in President Clinton's speech last night is that he still does not understand what needs to occur and where it needs to occur for grades kindergarten through high school. President Clinton last night repeated his belief that politics should stop at the schoolhouse door. I agree. I do not know anybody who does not agree. President Clinton should get out of the schoolhouse doorway and allow real education and reform to help the kids inside those schools. 
What we saw last night was education proposals that ignored giving parents and local communities real power and real choices; ignored real reform in favor of business as usual--we call it the status quo around here--spending increases, and paying for all these new programs with money the Government does not even have and may not ever have. I repeat, paying for all these new programs in the State of the Union with money the Government does not have and may never have. 
We have a better way. It is called BOOKS, the Better Opportunities for Our Kids and Schools Act. 
Madam President, BOOKS has several very powerful provisions that do exactly what I just alluded to--give new authority and choice to parents, give new authority and choice to States and local school districts that move decisionmaking capability to the people on the frontline and away from the Washington bureaucrat who could not associate a single face with a single name. 
Title I. A-plus accounts, education savings accounts. Parents can contribute $2,500 a year for a child's K through 12 education--public, private, religious or home schools. Everybody wins no matter where their children are in school. I might add that if they chose, they could keep those savings accounts on through higher education as well. 
Dollars could be used for a home computer, the tutor that is needed for a math deficiency, tuition or the expenses of home schooling; 75 percent of these massive new resources would be used by those in public schools. They would be a major winner. And 70 percent of the people taking advantage of the savings account earn less than $75,000 per year. The Joint Tax Committee is the source of this estimate. The cost would be $2.6 billion over the next 5 years. Basically, what we are saying is that we are going to leave $2.6 billion in the checking accounts of parents trying to help their children. 
Title II. Dollars to the classroom. Dollars to the classroom would block grant about $3 billion to States and continue to send 
$7 billion in title I, part A funds to the States with only one requirement--that 95 percent of those Federal dollars go to the classroom to where the kids are, not where the bureaucracy offices are. So the money to the disadvantaged children stays the same with the exception we want it in the classroom, and we free $3 billion a year so that those local school districts can do what they need to do. Do they need to hire teachers? Then they hire the teachers. Do they need to build schools? Then they build schools. Whatever it is they need--not what we envision they may need--could be done through dollars to the classroom. Bureaucracy eats up scarce dollars as State and local governments comply with Washington's strings. This is not new. It has become endemic in our Government. 
Even in title I, the moneys that go to the disadvantaged, 99 percent reaches the school district but 4 to 13 percent is eaten up by administrative costs--4 to 13 percent. That is big dollars. The $3 billion block grant could pay for as many as 50,000 teachers a year and 1 million new computers every year or it could pay for building up to 500 elementary schools. The key point here it is their choice--their choice. 
Title III. Opportunity and safety for low-income children. This is a 5-year pilot choice program at 20 to 30 sites to allow low-income children to attend a safe school through a choice system. We would invest $75 million for 1 year on this project. 
I do want to point out, Madam President, that this is voluntary. This is not imposed on anyone. In fact, with the exception of requiring that Federal dollars go to the classroom at the 95 percent level, there is nothing in the BOOKS Act that is mandatory. It defines, under this title, low income as 185 percent of the poverty line. Unsafe schools are those with high crime rates, serious drug problems and disciplinary problems. This gives kids at risk a chance to attend a public, charter, private, or sectarian school where the emphasis is on learning, not survival. 
Madam President, I just think it is unconscionable policy to order children to go to schools that are certifiably unsafe and drug ridden. 
Title IV. Testing and merit pay for teachers. It allows States to use Federal funds to reward good teachers and weed out the bad, and it will make it easier for States to carry out performance assessments of teachers and establish merit pay programs. Americans across the board agree with these concepts. Reward good teachers, weed out the bad, and make it easier for States to carry out performance assessment of teachers. 
Title V. Reading excellence. This is similar to Chairman Bill Goodling's bill in the House which passed the House by a voice vote on November 8, 1997. 
Madam President, it would provide $210 million for teacher training and individual grants for K through 12 reading instruction. It requires funds to be spent on programs demonstrated by scientific research to be effective, like phonics. It gives parents of kids at risk the ability to purchase additional tutoring assistance through grants. 
President Clinton's America Reads program which cost $2.7 billion over 5 years proposed sending semitrained volunteers into the classroom. This is a flawed concept, when you would send a semitrained volunteer into a classroom that has already demonstrated that it is not teaching a student to read. So you would send an unprofessional volunteer to help the student read better--that is not logical. The reading excellence title requires funds to be spent on programs proven effective by scientific research to enable the teacher to improve his or her skills so that she or he can teach the student to read. 
Title VI is the teacher and student safety title. This title allows the use of Federal funds to move victims of violence to safe schools. They could be a public, private or sectarian schools. The key here is if the student has become a victim, there should be nothing in the way of that school board's ability to move the student to a safe place. It allows use of noneducational funds--Victims of Crime Act administered by the Department of Justice--for innovative programs to help victims and witnesses of crime on school property. And it encourages the use of immediate notification and annual report cards to parents and teachers about incidents of violence and drugs at schools. 
Title VII is the Charter Schools Expansion Act title. This is similar to Congressman Riggs' bill which passed the House 367 to 57 on November 7. This provision of the legislation ensures charter schools are eligible for their fair share of Federal funding, whether it is title I, IDEA, or title VI block grants. Charter schools are public schools freed of many of the regulations in turn for increased accountability in terms of student outcomes. Without excessive regulation these schools are better able to design programs tailored to the needs of students and communities. 
Madam President, I see we have been joined by my good colleague from Nebraska. I am going to turn to the Senator in just a minute or so here. 
Under title VIII, the last title, we say the Federal Government should honor its agreement, which it made when it imposed special education requirements on local education, to fund a sizable portion of it. We agreed to fund up to 40 percent but we have never done it. You know, it's one of those stories, `The check is in the mail.' It never quite gets there. 
Senator Gregg deserves a lot of credit for this. He started the process last year but this would finish it with $9.3 billion over the next 6 years to fully honor our commitment to fund special ed, which we call IDEA. That would free up $9.3 billion for local communities to assess and take care of their own specific needs. That is the general description of the proposal our conference announced on January 20. 
I now turn to my colleague and good friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, for up to 7 minutes.

Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the Senator from Arkansas. I think he very adroitly draws the distinction between our proposal, which frees these local communities to make decisions about what they need, in distinction to the last 30 or 40 years where more and more and more we have somebody, as you say, who couldn't recognize one of the students, trying to set the priorities, and all the assistance we send is with a mandate to shackle the local school boards. 
Everywhere I go--I don't know about yourself--but it is over and over I am being told that you all are going to have to decide. `You all have to let us teach these kids.' Or, `Are you going to keep mandating us and throttling us down with all of your agendas?' And while we have been doing that, we, each year, have more and more data suggesting that the children cannot do the basics, cannot read right, they cannot understand the basic science, and they cannot add and subtract. 
If they cannot do that, they cannot succeed in our society. I think you have adroitly hit it. And I appreciate your work on dollars to these local systems. 
We have now been joined, Madam President, by the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator Mack. I yield Senator Mack up to 10 minutes.

Mr. COVERDELL. I commend the Senator from Florida. It is an absolutely fascinating story. There are many of these around the country. 
Just to make a point, of late when you read the statistics of 4 in 10 are all that can pass in urban city schools' basic standards tests, 3 in 10, 4 in 10 go to college, as you have noted, and have to go back and learn these skills again. We are beginning to hear an echo that these students were not educable, that there was something wrong someplace else, something wrong at home, something wrong with society. 
What kind of community was this? What was the surrounding like around this school? Was this a very wealthy suburb?

Mr. COVERDELL. As always, Madam President, I enjoyed the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. He brings that clear Western thinking to the Senate. 
If I might add a thought, it is a little hard to believe, but this Congress passed the first balanced budget in the 104th Congress. That was vetoed by the President. We did it again. So we passed two. The President signed it. It is the first one in 30 years. In 30 years Washington has never developed the will to balance its budget. It passed the first tax relief in the last Congress. That was vetoed. A modified tax relief was passed last year. That was signed. That is the first tax relief in 16 years. 
Now, I don't know what the situation is in Wyoming but that tax relief proposal leaves $750 million every year in Georgia checking accounts of working families, businesses, people sending kids to school and college, trying to make ends meet. It left $750 million in those accounts. It was not a particularly large tax reduction. But it means a lot. It puts about 2,000 additional dollars in the checking account of an average family. 
Now, the point I am making is this, and I would like to get the Senator's comment, don't you find it interesting that once the United States balanced its budget, once it has become more engaged in managing its financial affairs, how much more optimistic the people are, how many more of them of working, how interest rates have stayed somewhat down, and how we are talking about surpluses for the first time? Pretty remarkable, very remarkable. It ought to be a lesson to every Congress and every President. This is a good idea. We better keep doing it.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for her excellent remarks and her dedication to leaving money in the checking accounts of people who earn it. 
Let me just say in closing, because I know we are going to the other side, that to me American liberty and freedom rests on three principal stanchions: Economic liberty, which means workers can keep the fruits of their labors and make decisions about their lives and fulfill their responsibilities. We have been talking about that here today making sure we leave resources with American workers and families so that they can do the job and always be dependent upon them to do so in America. 
No. 2, for freedom to exist people have to be safe. They have to be secure at work and at home and in their school. We talked about making them safer today. 
Last, but certainly not least, an uneducated mind cannot enjoy the benefits of American citizenship. An uneducated mind is denied American liberty. The first major denial occurs, as Senator D'Amato from New York said, when they are denied economic liberty because they cannot get a job and they cannot connect with the vast opportunity in society. 
So America has to get about the task of assuring that all her children and her population have the fundamentals to be free and to enjoy American freedom. And that is what we have been talking about today. We want America to be educated so that she will remain free. 
We want workers to be able to benefit from their work so that they can do the job of raising their families and fulfilling their responsibilities as American citizens. And we know they have to be safe because no commerce, no civil interaction can occur in a society that is violence-ridden. And that is what we have been talking about all afternoon. 
If you keep America educated, you give her citizens economic viability and options; protect them at home and in the workplace and school, America will be just fine. Our people will take this country and build a new American century. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize an outstanding institution in my home state of Georgia, Darton College. 
Recently, I was contacted by one of the school's students who wrote to express his pride and support of his school and the educational opportunity that he is being provided. Mr. President, it is my belief that the finest accolade a school can receive is the praise of its students and, in turn, their success. 
There are many battles on the American playing field each day, in the business world, political world, the judicial world, but none can be more important than those being fought in the classrooms of our learning institutions. Because, after all, our nation depends on these educational institutions to provide us with the necessary tools to win the other battles we encounter in our lifetime. 
Mr. President, with that in mind, I would like to express my support for continued success and prosperity for past, current and future students, faculty and staff of Darton College.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 1998. Last year, this Congress passed historic legislation: the Balanced Budget Act providing the first balanced budget in nearly thirty years, and the Taxpayer Relief Act providing tax relief for the first time in sixteen years. As a result, faith in the Nation's economy is strong, and we are seeing the results of that faith. 
Now is the time for us to consider sweeping middle class tax relief. This tax relief proposal accomplishes several goals. First, it directs the vast majority of the relief to those who feel the tax squeeze the most: middle-income taxpayers. 
Second, because it is across-the-board relief, every middle class taxpayers wins. Every American earning $25,000 taxable income or more would see relief. Estimates by the Tax Foundation show that approximately 25 million taxpayers would see tax relief this year with two-thirds earning less than $75,000 annually. 
Third, it provides significant marriage penalty relief without adding complexity to the tax code. 
Fourth, this is one of the very few proposals that is also entirely consistent with the long-term goal of a flatter, simpler tax code. 
My proposal, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act, achieves these goals by raising the roof on the 15% individual income tax bracket. In other words, it returns middle class taxpayers to the lowest individual income bracket. Married couples with taxable income of $70,000 or less would be taxed at the 15% tax bracket, an increase over the 1998 threshold of $42,350. The threshold for heads of households would be $52,600, an increase over the current threshold of $33,950. Finally, the thresholds for single workers would be set at $35,000, an increase over the current threshold of $25,350. 
In the coming weeks, a great deal of discussion will focus on providing the American people with the tax relief they need and deserve, and how that is to be accomplished. There are a number of proposals providing tax relief, some of which I am a supporter. However, I believe the Middle Class Tax Relief Act will be successful ultimately because it is actually achievable during this Congress. I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska for yielding time. It is with great pleasure and relief, I must say, that I come to the floor to hail what I believe will be final passage of the 1998 Defense authorization conference report. As many of my colleagues know, this was not an easy process. This bill, of vital importance to our men and women in uniform, has sparked much controversy over the last several months. 
My colleagues may remember my taking the floor, along with several of my colleagues, this summer to denounce what we felt was a politicization of the BRAC process by the President. At the time, I stated that we will not begin a new round of BRAC, as the administration has called for, until the previous round's recommendations have been carried out effectively. To my satisfaction, a new round of BRAC has been averted and we have taken a step in the right direction toward restoring BRAC integrity. 
The approach we have taken on military depot work in this bill is a win for our Armed Forces and taxpayers. In this bill, we promote private-public competition, as my colleagues called for, while establishing more objective criteria in making contract awards. 
I would like to commend my colleagues on both sides of this issue for working to develop a solution to the impasse we reached. Obviously, as a Senator with a remaining air logistic center, I have a vested stake in the issue. While not a member of the Armed Services Committee, I voiced my opinion strongly with my colleagues from California and Texas and have respected their position. It is unfortunate that we have not been able to reach an ultimate agreement on the issue, but we have come to our disagreement after much debate and consideration on both sides. 
I point out to my colleagues, however, that it says a great deal about a piece of legislation when the chairman, ranking member, and majority and minority leaders all agree on the approach we have taken in this bill. 
I would be remiss not to mention the tremendous contribution that our chairman, Senator Thurmond, has once again added to this process. He and his staff have worked tirelessly to develop this legislation and to work for a compromise on the depot issue. I also want to thank my colleagues from Utah and Oklahoma--particularly Senator Inhofe, who has worked equally as hard in trying to reach a compromise on the issue. They are all to be commended. 
Finally, I understand that there is an important pay raise provision in this bill for our armed services members. This is of great importance because I think we have arrived at a good place, a solid plan. I encourage my colleagues to support it. Further, I call on the President to sign it as quickly as possible. We need to move on with this bill and what I feel is correcting a fundamental flaw in the system. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senator from New Jersey for his remarks, and more importantly, for his steadfast support of this proposal, and not always under the easiest of circumstances. He has been a great colleague and advocate and I have enjoyed working with him on this proposal. 
Where we find ourselves, moments away from this vote, Mr. President, is that the filibuster could not be broken last week and it was suggested that if we could just iron out a few amendments that both sides would come together. 
Over the weekend we suggested that we would agree to two or three amendments on both sides and try to proceed. That would require a unanimous consent, or for those listening, a unanimous agreement--everybody will have to agree. The other side of the aisle cannot secure that. 
Given the hour of this session, this is no time to open it up to a free-for-all. So the filibuster will probably continue and my prediction is, fall a vote or two short of ending the filibuster and proceeding with what would be easy passage of the education savings account. It is unfortunate, because every time we delay these ideas another week, another month, we just slow down the great need to get at the problems in education in grades kindergarten through high school. 
Every time we delay, we create another student whose economic opportunity, whose challenges in this society will be inhibited because of a lack of resources that might have been made available to that child. 
However, the adoption of this concept is inevitable. The status quo, which has fought from day one and continues to do everything it can to block almost any new idea, will not prevail. The American people will override the status quo, and ideas like the education savings account are going to become law. My prediction is that, come February 1998, this proposal will be back before us and we will ultimately secure passage of it. 
Just a reminder. Mr. President, the education savings account will allow families to save up to $2,500 a year of their own aftertax money, and the interest buildup would not be taxed if the proceeds of the principal and interest are used to help an education purpose--essentially, grades kindergarten through high school, which is where our problems are; although it could be used in college. 
Senator Dodd, in his remarks, inferred that these were resources that were going to allow somebody to enjoy private education. I think it's important that we take an overview of the entire proposal. The Joint Committee on Taxation says that the education savings account will be used by 14 million American families. That probably equates to 20 to 25 million children that would be the beneficiaries of this concept. That is almost half the school population in the United States that would benefit from this new structure, this education savings account. And 10.8 million of these families would be families with children in public schools. Seventy percent of all the value of these savings accounts will go to augment public schools. Thirty percent will augment those that are in a private school. 
It is statistically insignificant, but it is a fact that some families will use the account to change schools. But in the overall picture, you are essentially bringing new dollars that don't have to be taxed, new dollars that people are saving themselves and, as Senator Torricelli said, families becoming involved, families setting aside money to augment the child's education deficiency. 
Now, I call these dollars smart dollars. They are smart dollars because the family is directing their expenditure, and we know that it will, therefore, go to the exact child deficiency, which may be the fact that the child does not have a home computer; it may be that the child needs a math tutor; it may be that the child is experiencing dyslexia or some medical problem and the family will be able to augment and help support a learning disability. Well, the list goes on and on and on, as to the kind of particular or peculiar deficiencies that the child may suffer. This allows a resource to be gathered together to be put right on the problem. Unfortunately, you can't get that kind of utility for most public dollars. 
As Senator Torricelli said, 70 percent of all these resources will assist families making $75,000 or less. So it's going right to the hardest pressed, the middle class. It's right on target. 
Mr. President, there is another unique feature about the education savings account. The education savings account, which for most people would resemble an IRA, is different in that it would allow sponsors to contribute to the account. That could be an extended family member, an uncle, aunt, cousin, grandparent. More importantly, it could be a church, it could be an employer, it could be a community assistance organization, it could be a labor union. The imagination can't even perceive the kinds of community activities. How often have we seen a law enforcement officer fall in the line of duty and the community wants to come forward to help? This is the kind of tool that would be used. That community could set up an education savings account for the surviving children so that they would be more able to deal with their educational needs as they grow older without their father or mother. 
I can envision a company saying, well, we will put $50 a month in the account for the children that work for our employees if the employee will match it. By the end of the year, that would be half of the amount of money that is legally available; that would be $1,200. So it's an instrument that allows the entire community, the entire family to bring together resources to help with whatever problem that child may confront when they get to school. 
The other side has tried to describe it as a voucher. It's not. A voucher is public money given to the parents to decide what to do with. This is the parents' money. This is private money. We are allowing the parents an opportunity to get focused on that child's education, and just with the attention alone in creating 14 million family accounts like this, there will be an attitude change. You know, they can get focused on it and they think of their child and what that child needs, and they will have an exhilarated feeling of putting a resource in that account once a month, or every quarter, or on holidays, as Senator Torricelli said. 
They have said this goes to the wealthy. It does not. It goes to the middle class. They have even said, at one point, well, it doesn't amount to much. If it doesn't, I can't imagine why in the devil I am facing this filibuster and why the President said he would veto the entire tax relief plan if this proposal were in the tax relief bill. 
Mr. President, this is an idea whose time has come. The education savings account is going to become law. It is just a matter of time. I hoped we could do it in this session, but I think the filibuster is, once again, going to deny a good idea. America, as Senator Torricelli said, is focused on education. It will not accept the status quo. It is going to force new ideas. We cannot afford to have a failed elementary education system in place as we come to the new century. 
So, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that have stood up to the special interests and have said we are going to change the status quo. I appreciate all the assistance from the colleagues on my side of the aisle. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAMS Mr. President, today we will vote on whether to invoke cloture on a bill--H.R. 2646--that would allow parents to save money for their children's education without incurring tax liability. 
The proposed new education savings account, which expands existing law, would allow families to contribute up to $2,500 per year in a savings account for a variety of public or private education-related expenses. Congress had earlier voted to support the Coverdell amendment 59 to 41, on June 27. 
Currently, the reconciliation law we passed this year as part of the budget agreement, allows parents to save up to $500 per year for their children's college education without penalty. 
The new education savings accounts are more expansive in that they allow the money to be used for children's kindergarten through 12th grade education expenses as well as college. 
Our adoption of this bill without further delay comes at a notable time, a time of increasing focus on the future of America's children. Just over a week ago, the White House held a summit intended to bring children's issues into the forefront as a national priority. 
What better way to turn consensus-building into action than to give parents the practical tool which the Coverdell bill supplies; a tool which allows parents to better provide options for their children's education. 
The education savings accounts help working families. They are a good complement to the $500 per child tax credit I have long championed, which was included in the tax bill this year. They encourage savings and allow families to make plans which shape a child's future. 
This provision is directed at low and middle income families, not wealthy families who currently have education options. All families should have a better opportunity to choose the best education for their children. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the great majority of families expected to take advantage of the education savings accounts have incomes of $75,000 or less. 
In other words, in families where both parents are working, individual parent income is at the very most an average of $37,500 in more than two-thirds of the families expected to take advantage of this legislation. Clearly, these are the families who need our help the most. 
Mr. President, this important legislation offers a real solution for America's working families. We must act now to help families best provide for one of life's most basic necessities--a child's education.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of H.R. 2646, the A-plus education bill. What has become known as the A-plus account, or education savings account, is a unique instrument that is being designed to help American families across the land to deal with education deficiencies, particularly in grades K-12, kindergarten through high school, although the account may be kept intact and used for higher education if that is the desire of the family. 
Simply put, a family could save up to $2,500 every year from the child's birth in a savings account much like an IRA that most Americans have come to understand, a similar instrument. These are after-tax dollars. The interest that would build up each succeeding year would not be taxed if the proceeds of the account are used for virtually any educational purpose. So it becomes a tool that empowers parents to deal with particular or peculiar deficiencies of the child. 
As a result, my own view is that the value of these dollars could be as much as three to five times a typical public dollar being spent because the dollar is being directed at the unique deficiency. 
Let's say, for example, the child had a learning disability, or dyslexia, that required special attention. The dollars could be put right on that problem. Or perhaps the child had a math deficiency and it required a tutor, or there was a transportation problem to deal with an after-school program, or a learning disability of some form. All of these particular problems, broad dollars cannot necessarily address, but these savings accounts can. They can go right to the deficiency. 
A unique feature of the savings account is that the account can receive contributions from sponsors. When you do that, the imagination begins to work at the different kinds of things that could happen to help build this account up for this child. A corporation, an employer, could be a contributor to these accounts. You can envision matching circumstances, where an employer would say I'll put so much in your children's account if you'll match it. You can imagine a church becoming involved in these types of accounts. I can see a community--recently in Atlanta we lost a law enforcement officer, and people are often trying to find a way to help the remaining family. I can see communities stepping forward in this case and establishing an account for the surviving children. So community, employers, extended family, brothers, uncles, neighbors, grandparents--all of these individuals could become sponsors of these children's accounts. 
As a result, a large infusion of enrichment will occur to education in America, one of the largest in 10 years--billions of dollars. The Joint Committee on Taxation has advised us that 14 million families will make use of these accounts--14 million families. A quick estimation there shows you somewhere around 20 million-plus children, approaching half of children in America's schools, will be beneficiaries to some degree of these accounts. 
It baffles me that some in the professional system, the National Education Association, oppose this. They want to believe and others to think that--I think the line is that it only will help wealthy people and that it will only support religious schools. Both assertions are utterly false. 
I have been stunned by an organization of this character being so misleading about a matter of public policy. You would think that an organization associated with schooling and role modeling for young people could do a little better job of being candid and straightforward about their opposition. It has had some effect, because many people think the savings account is the equivalent of a voucher. A voucher--which I support; they don't--but a voucher is the redistribution of public money. In other words, the money raised from the public for taxes, property taxes or the like, is given to the family and they can move it to any point they would like. That is a voucher. This is a savings account. This is not public money. This is private after-tax money. And we are not taxing the buildup. 
Under their definition of public money, I guess the capital gains tax reduction would be a voucher because we have left money in someone's checking account and they can use it some way they choose. But, in any event, the allegation is that it is for the wealthy and that it supports religious schools. 
Here are the facts. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, of the 14 million families that will use these accounts, 10.8 million of them will be in families whose children are in public schools; 70 percent of the funds generated, this enrichment, this additional effort and energy coming behind our school system, private and voluntary, will go to support public schools--70 percent--and 30 percent to private schools. 
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 70 percent of all these funds will go to support children and families earning $75,000 or less. It is means tested. It is not for the wealthy. It has sponsors, so that we can help those who have a tough time organizing the accounts, and the principal beneficiary will be the public school system of America and the families in it. 
Mr. President, I yield at this time.

I now yield up to 4 minutes to my good colleague from Connecticut. I want to just say that he, Senator Lieberman, has been at the forefront of education reform for more years than I. He is very dedicated to these proposals, and his support of this measure has been personally and publicly appreciated.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut. He has made excellent points. This has already been passed by 59 votes in the Senate. It has been passed by the House. It is an extension of a proposal that both bodies overwhelmingly passed. I am fearful that we are in the midst of a filibuster attempt by special interests to block it, but we are going to stay at it, filibuster or not.

Mr. COVERDELL. I understand the leadership on the other side and the NEA are endeavoring to filibuster this proposal, but they will not succeed in the long run. This is going to happen. 
I do want to respond quickly to several of the remarks of the Senator from Illinois. First, the figures from the Treasury Department have been ridiculed and rejected. They have absolutely no credibility. That is the same formula they used to try to discredit the other tax relief. They used imputed income --if you rent your house, that sort of thing. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation says 75 percent of all these proceeds will go to people making $75,000 or less.

Mr. COVERDELL. I cannot yield because of the time. I know the Senator will appreciate that. 
I also want to point out that the formula that governs this account is the same one the Senator from Illinois voted for in the tax relief plan when the IRA saving account was set up for higher education. It is identical. The Senator from Illinois has already voted for this account. The distribution of the moneys is identical. In those accounts, like these accounts, 70 percent of it will go to families earning $75,000 or less. 
The Senate and House have already expressed themselves on it. It is means tested. It is the same formula your President and my President requested be put in place. The same one that governs those accounts, you and I both voted for, as did the vast majority. It is the same formula on this account. 
Now, the Senator has suggested this is something new. This is an IRA. They have been here for 17 years. The Senate already cast 59 votes for this account in the tax relief proposal. The House has passed it. This is not some new idea, snaking through the Halls of Congress. We have been dealing with IRA's for almost two decades. 
The last point I make, and I understand the misunderstanding because of some of the administration views, I want to remind the Senator that 70 percent of all these new resources which would supplement education will go to students in public schools. Public schools are going to be the big winner here. And 10.8 million families with children in public schools will use these accounts--so there will be an enrichment of the public school system--of the 14 million, so that means less than 3 million will be in private schools.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will proceed to consideration of H.R. 2646, the A-plus education bill, with the time until 10:30 a.m. being equally divided between Senator Coverdell and Senator Daschle or his designee. Following the debate time, the Senate will conduct a cloture vote on the A-plus education bill. Therefore, Members can anticipate the first rollcall vote today at approximately 10:30 a.m. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on a motion to proceed to the Defense Authorization Act conference report. Members can anticipate additional procedural votes on that measure. 
In addition, the Senate may consider the District of Columbia appropriations bill, the Amtrak strike resolution, or any additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared. 
As a reminder to all Members, the first rollcall vote this morning will occur at 10:30 a.m.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to apprise my colleagues of a terrible mistake made by the President and the administration in its issuing a veto on the $6.8 million HH-60 Operations Pararescue Unit project at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, GA. 
I am aware of the interest of my colleague, Senator Cleland, in this matter, and I understand that he has joined me in questioning the rationale behind the abuse of power by the President. We just heard an excellent statement from my colleague, Senator Cleland, of Georgia, on this very matter. 
In looking at this project at Moody, it is important to understand, first, that this pararescue unit is critical to our combat search and rescue training operations which allow this group to function in a proper capacity. 
As you may know, Mr. President, pararescue units are imperative to instilling in our fighting forces the battlefield and training confidence necessary for just the type of confidence that we have earned in this century. 
The administration claimed that the Moody project was not needed for several reasons--such as budget requests, quality of life, and construction capability. We now know that these assertions are not accurate. The Air Force has distinct plans to fund the Moody project which was included in the Air Force's 1999 budget request. Officials at Moody inform me that they could have, indeed, begun construction on the project this year. 
Finally, the Pentagon in 1996 announced its plans to move two squadrons, the 41st and the 71st, from Patrick Air Force Base, FL, to Moody Air Force Base in Georgia. 
A small number of personnel began quartering at Moody as early as October of 1996, and subsequently moved the squadron there in its entirety in April of 1997. Make no mistake. The move is now complete, and the personnel are operating out of temporary trailers at Moody as we speak here today. 
What greater quality of life issue exists for the nearly 2,200 military personnel and their families that this mission has brought to Moody? 
We need to move expeditiously on this legislation to correct this error. The administration did not know, Mr. President, that the squadrons were already in Georgia. They believed they were still in Florida when they exercised this veto. 
On this note, I commend my colleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, for bringing this bill before the Senate. I ask for my colleagues' support. 
Mr. President, if I might make an inquiry of my colleague from Georgia, did he still prefer to participate if the colloquy here this afternoon, or did you want to just enter that into the Record?

And, of course, when something like this happens, you have over 2,000 families in Georgia who are living in temporary facilities, and it is imperative that this error, this mistake, be overturned, which, of course, would be among the many, many issues that are in Senator Stevens' bill. 
So my colleague from Georgia and I are both rising in support of that to get this error corrected. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the American Legion Auxiliary, State of Georgia, and their efforts in assisting educational opportunities for fellow Georgians. Specifically, as it has recently come to my attention, they have distributed $10,125 toward the education of 21 medical students in Georgia. In addition, $3,678.55, given by the Past Presidents Parley, was equally distributed to the following medical college students: Regina Lewis, of unit 107; Laura Sargent, of unit 64; Krista Nicole Swann, of unit 160. 
As we continue to strive to better our country and the educational opportunities it promotes, it is vital that we work in partnership with organizations like the American Legion Auxiliary so all of our fellow Americans may reach their goals.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I, too, commend the Senator from Kansas for his illuminating remarks and the Senator from Kentucky for enduring this process for now years. 
I want to come to the reference to the Constitution by the Senator from Kansas. The Constitution that says that: Congress shall enact no law to abridge speech. 
It does not say there are no exemptions. It says the Congress shall enact no law to abridge speech. 
Let us put this in context. This language is in the first amendment of the Bill of Rights which grants us the right to speak as we would, the right to worship as we would, the right to assemble, which is also part of this debate, and the right to petition our Government without fear. 
All of us would like to see the campaign process improved. There have been many who have mentioned transparency or disclosure, making sure that the American people know what is happening and when it is happening and trust in their judgment to make good decisions about whether they like it or do not. 
This legislation abridges the Constitution, begins to manage speech, picks winners and losers, and attacks the fundamental rights of assembly. 
You have to go back. In the early days, particularly 1775, before you could create a society or an association in the United Kingdom--which was the genesis of all the secret societies. The forefathers here knew of all of this activity. So that is why they framed the language that Congress shall enact no law to abridge freedom of speech or the right to associate. They had vivid memories of governments that prohibited and managed speech and threatened and intimidated people who spoke freely and forbid organizations from joining together for the purpose of petitioning or speaking out. The language in the Constitution is derived from the fear those people had of what goes on when governments tell people what they can say and when they can say it. 
This legislation picks corporations that can say anything they want and picks other corporations and says they cannot say anything. People up here in the gallery are represented by corporations that would have no prohibition whatsoever. Cox Broadcasting, one of the largest communications institutions in the world, could say anything it chose through all of its affiliates, the Atlanta papers, their cable television, whatever, could say anything they chose about any candidate, their motives for or against any vote as often as they wanted at any time they chose under this legislation, but Georgia Pacific, which grows trees, could not. 
I want to know, what is the difference between corporation A that happens to print a newspaper and corporation B that happens to grow trees? The forefathers said there shall be no difference. But this legislation says that we will manage the difference here. Cox Communications, say anything you want. Georgia Pacific, you're out. Shove off. 
It picks certain kinds of corporations that are at liberty to participate and others that are removed from participation. That is an abridgement of the Constitution. 
Let us come to this business of association, the right to associate, to say what you want, and what constitutes free speech. 
In those days there were pamphlets. Now it is television and radio, telecommunications and computers. This legislation says free speech is only given to certain kinds of institutions and it is denied others. You know, the basic right to assemble, it says to those people, you can assemble, but, boy, you cannot say anything about a campaign for the 2 months before it. You cannot mention a candidate's name. You cannot participate. You cannot express your view, if you are for or against a candidate. 
So it is not only a violation of the principle of freedom of speech, but it is a violation of the principle of assembly. 
The forefathers envisioned people--the Farm Bureau--people coming together to make a case, to speak to an issue. This says, `No; that's a deterrent in our society. We're going to have to manage you. And we're going to remove you from the political process.' 
The last point I will make, Mr. President, is this: After you have tried to manage these processes, and you have given some people freedom of speech and others not, some that can assemble and some that cannot, what have you ended up with, outside of abridging the Constitution? You have reinforced the power of incumbents. Because if the money can only flow to candidates, which candidate is it going to flow to? The incumbent in power or the challenger? The person that is more known and has access to the facilities of that power or the person that is on the outside? 
Well, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to know the money will flow to the incumbent. You can call this the Incumbent Protection Act. It will be a magnet. It will move money to power. And it intimidates and chills people from speaking out, which has been--you know, the genesis of all American glory is our freedom. The genesis of all American glory is that we have been a free people, and it has made us behave in unique ways. We are bold. We are visionary. We are builders. And we are not afraid. This kind of legislation chills and separates and is not healthy to the Republic. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to comment on the revelations--that is a good word for it--the `revelations' of the hearings on the Internal Revenue Service which were chaired by the distinguished Senator, Bill Roth of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
I think those hearings, while not of any particular surprise to most Americans, nevertheless riveted the country on a confirmation, a ratification, of one dinner discussion and one office coffee klatch after another that had gone on across the country for years that expresses itself in almost every public meeting I attend. Somebody would say, `What are we going to do about this IRS? When are you going to do something about this?' 
So it has had the effect of emboldening the Nation as some rather courageous people stepped forward and told their story publicly. American after American said, `Well, that is exactly what happened to me.' 
It is interesting, but over the last year I have been working with a citizen who made about $19,000 a year and earned an extra $1,000 tutoring and mistakenly thought that the check that he got for this tutoring was after the taxes had been taken out. That was the error. It took the IRS 3 years to discover that. It happened in threats to garnish the wages, letters that one might expect if they were inside a prison preparing to be dragged out for public scorn--threats for the tax on the $1,000 that they discovered wasn't collected 3 years past. By the end of the day, which probably will be another 2 years or more, this fellow will have paid in penalties and in fines almost $4,000. The fellow who makes $19,000 a year--$4,000 in fines and penalties because they didn't get the tax on the $1,000. What would that be? A couple of hundred bucks. That is debtor's prison. That is what that is. 
There is not a Member of Congress who cannot cite story after story like that. There is just no excuse for that kind of behavior in this country. 
It did make me think and feel that there was a growing propensity to go after--I couldn't certify it--but to go after people who can't defend themselves; easy pickings. This fellow could do nothing to defend himself. Fortunately, at least, we were able to help keep his whole life from collapsing. But this ought not to be the case. 
I was reading an article by James Pinkerton, who was in the Bush White House, in the Washington edition of the Los Angeles Times. It is very interesting. He draws several conclusions, but the first one is important. 
His first conclusion is that power corrupts. He said, `This is not a new lesson perhaps but an enduring one, and in this particular case we need to be reminded that civil liberties properly extend beyond protesters and criminals to include taxpayers and small businesses.' 
This fellow that I just talked about, no one in the country should be treated that way by Government employees. They work for this fellow, not the other way around. You would think there would be some feeling of concern about a citizen who was having a tough time anyway. You would think there would be some understanding that this was no purposeful act, this was a mistake, and it ought to have been a simple correction; settle it. But, no. I mean, here we go rolling our way through another $3,000 or $4,000 in fines and penalties. 
Power corrupts. 
The second conclusion is interesting. `IRS employees are people too, which means that when revenuers become immersed in the shackled-by-their-ankles enforcement culture of the IRS'--which is what this fellow had happen to him--`some become tyrants and many turn into income maximizers. The IRS established its field office performance index quietly flouting a 1988 law that forbade quotas on tax collection.' The law said there will not be quotas. Who over there decided that the law didn't apply to them? 
The President the other day said, `Well, it is better than it used to be.' Well, for Heaven's sake, I can't imagine what it used to be. 
`It turned its 33 district managers into `taxpreneurs' by offering cash awards to top performers.' 
In other words, if you could get out there--it is like the old speeding ticket scams that we used to read about where the officer on the patrol was rewarded by how many tickets he could give. 
I think it probably was pretty stunning to all of those who were watching those hearings to know that even though there is a law that says you cannot have a quota on tax collections, they did it anyway. 
Another conclusion: `The checks and balances system is not just constitutional philosophy. It is a practical safeguard for liberty.' 
In other words, the checks and balances that our forefathers put into the American system, so that, to get at the first conclusion he made that power corrupts, the understanding of that, the forefathers created a government in which one branch was always looking over the other. 
Here is a perfect case where the executive branch has a rogue situation, doing nothing about it, and the Congress steps forward and finally assimilates all of these complaints and all of these allegations. We have the spectacular hearings, and, lo and behold, what do we find? 
`As so often happens in these situations, the IRS insisted that it had done no wrong.' 
There was nothing wrong over there. These are just disgruntled taxpayers. 
But we have the hearings, and what happens? The IRS apologizes, saying, you are right, we have been doing this, and says it won't do it again. 
I see I have been joined by my good colleague from Arizona. I will make one more point about this article, and then I am going to turn to him. 
The fourth conclusion was that more than two decades ago an economist named Arthur Laffer started a fiscal revolution by stating the obvious, that too high rates of taxation, if you make them too high, become counterproductive. You get into this maze of circumstances and a code that becomes horribly complicated. `Power corrupts. We had an environment in the agency that fostered bullyism.' Thank Heaven, the forefathers had checks and balances so this could be discovered. We made a mess of the Tax Code. We are getting a better, better view of this thing, and there will have to be something done about it and not excuses made for it. 
With that, Mr. President, I turn to my colleague, the good Senator from Arizona, and yield up to 10 minutes, if that is sufficient.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for his comments today and, more importantly, for his dedication to efforts to improve this predicament we have gotten into here. 
I spent the first several minutes talking about several conclusions that a very thoughtful young man had put together after watching these hearings. I think he pretty much echoes what probably would be the views of the American public, that the IRS, while there are many good employees in that large institution, has endemic and very, very serious problems. 
So you can understand my surprise when I pick up this past Tuesday, September 30, the Washington Times with a headline that says, `White House Champions IRS. President Opposes Citizen Oversight.' 
That is mind-boggling:  
The White House yesterday came to the defense of the embattled IRS, vowing to vigorously oppose Congressional efforts to create a citizen oversight board to protect Americans from agency abuses. It is a recipe for conflicts of interest, and the notion that the right way to deal with these problems with the IRS is to decrease accountability and have part-time managers who would be themselves involved in a range of financial transactions would be a serious backward step. 
So it is better to leave it as it is, I guess, as if the people who currently manage it are not taxpayers and are not involved with financial transactions. The current manager is the Secretary of the Treasury, spent his life in financial transactions. 
They warned the Congress against reacting hastily by legislating broad reforms that could lead to the death of the agency. 
Defend the status quo. Leave things the way they are. Things are actually improved. I wonder how many Americans believe that. How could anybody who watched those hearings come to the conclusion that things are better over there and that the Congress should sit here and sort of hold its hands and wait around and see if something improves. 
I am going to take just a moment here, Mr. President, to revisit apparently some of this the White House missed. 
Msgr. Lawrence Ballweg, an 82-year-old priest from Florida, told of `devious' IRS agents who erroneously tried to grab $18,000 from a trust fund for the poor set up by his late mother. 
Nancy Jacobs, a Bakersfield optometrist's wife, broke down in tears as she explained how aggressive IRS agents hounded her husband for 17 years because they mixed him up with another taxpayer. 
Of course, we all know that they spent $4 billion--billion --overhauling their systems, but for 17 years they could not figure out that they were chasing the wrong taxpayer--for 17 years. 
Tom Savage, a Delaware small businessman, said that the IRS concocted an imaginary company that he co-owned with another taxpayer, and then illegally seized $50,000 to pay for the other taxpayer's debts. 
Katherine Lund, an Apple Valley, CA, woman, described how the IRS could not keep track of its own records, repeatedly threatening to seize her home if she did not pay a tax debt left over from a former marriage. Although on three occasions she sought to clear the debt, another branch of the agency continued to pester her. 
Robert S. Schriebman, a tax attorney from Rolling Hills Estates, testified that in many instances IRS power is too great, citing the authority of the agency to seize homes-- 
Take a citizen's home-- with only the signature of a district director. 
How many cases are there that we all know of where the IRS has taken a taxpayer to court on a theory about the Tax Code and lost. Of course, by then the taxpayer has spent hours and hours and hours, suffered anxiety after anxiety and lost thousands of dollars, and won in court, setting a precedent on the theory being challenged, and they turn right around and sue another taxpayer on the same theory, paying no attention to the court precedent that had been set by their loss before. Maybe they will win the next one and just keep repeating it. 
I might add, the legislation I have introduced in the Senate and Congresswoman Dunn, from Washington State, in the House, would stop that practice, stop them from paying no attention to court precedents. 
Late in the hearing Wednesday, Jennifer Long, an IRS agent, testified--this is an IRS agent, testifying before a Senate Finance Committee--that the IRS had fabricated evidence--in other words, made it up, falsified it--in tax cases and targeted individuals who are vulnerable because of low income or modest education. If you remember, I cited a personal case, of which I have personal knowledge, of just that very thing happening: Just beat up on people who virtually have their hands tied behind their backs because they have no resources whatsoever with which to defend themselves. I repeat, an IRS agent testified before the committee that they made up evidence and targeted individuals who are vulnerable because of low income or modest education. 
I mentioned a moment ago the Apple Valley woman who drove to Washington with her current husband, Orange County prosecutor Jime Hicks, because the couple could not afford to fly with their children. `My credit is completely destroyed,' Ms. Lund said, `and my husband's credit is seriously damaged. We will suffer the effects of the IRS collection for the rest of our lives.' It is important to remember that, when you entangle the citizens in this activity, that you often alter the course of their lives forever. 
Ms. Lund laid out her story for nearly half an hour, at times breaking into tears. She said her problems with the agency started when the IRS assessed additional taxes of $7,000 after she had filed her 1983 tax return. By then she had divorced her previous husband and was unaware of the tax assessment. It takes them years to find these things out, but then they levee against it all the way back to the point of error, or mistake. The IRS repeatedly came after Lund to pay the bill. She paid the assessment three times, but the agency would send her the money back. You begin to get a hint, if you were getting these checks, that this person was trying to resolve the problem. They sent the money back, saying she did not owe them anything. Then another branch would dun her again. This is almost unbelievable. When she married her second husband, Hicks, the IRS went after him, too, attempting to levy his paycheck from Orange County earlier this year. The couple finally filed for divorce, not to escape their marriage, but to protect his check from the IRS. Lund and Hicks also nearly lost their home to an IRS lien. The entire snafu was caused by the IRS creating a collection record that was never noted in the master computer file, a procedure reflecting old equipment, and the error was corrected only after the committee took its findings to the IRS. So, from 1983 to 1997, this woman and her new husband have been pounded on and pounded on and pounded on by the IRS. 
In the case of Savage, the Delaware businessman, an investigation by the committee staff turned up evidence that the IRS had committed serious ethical errors. In 1993, the Justice Department warned H. Stephen Kesselman, the agency's district counsel in Philadelphia, not to pursue the case against Savage because its seizure--taking--of his check was wrongful, not right in the first place. Despite the Justice Department's advice, which was not disclosed to Savage until the hearings, the IRS continued pressing its case against him for another--now, listen--for another year and a half. They took the check improperly. The Justice Department told them they took the check improperly. The Justice Department warned the counsel of IRS they had done something in error. And then, for a year and a half, they kept doing it. Out of control. 
Savage eventually paid the agency $50,000 to settle the matter, fearing that a court fight would cost him even more. And every businessman who exists has been through that, in these days. He estimated the episode had cost him a quarter of a million dollars in lost business and legal fees, forcing him to continue working 4 additional years before he retired. 
I am going to come back to what I said a moment ago. The White House yesterday came to the defense of IRS, and has warned the Congress not to act hastily. I suggest that Treasury revisit the testimony before they start suggesting that the Congress should be patient, and not get overly concerned, things are better, and that we might act too hastily. 
Mr. President, we have been joined by my distinguished colleague from Alabama. I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama. I think it is particularly noteworthy that he brought to our attention the audit of the IRS itself, which we have all alluded to time and time again, and the badgering of our citizens, but they can't reconcile their own books. 
Mr. President, I read a moment ago that the White House's first reaction to all this is it is an overheated exercise and the IRS is really OK. 
My hometown paper is often a defender of the White House. I was quite taken by the Atlanta Constitution's response to the hearings with an editorial that led off: `Hey, GOP: Let's End Death Next.' 
That's supposed to be funny. `Over the years,' I will just read part of it, `you come to expect a certain level of hypocrisy in Washington, a certain level of posturing and theatrics that you assume to be the professional standard of the city,' says the Atlanta Constitution. `But then every once in a while, the world shifts and you are treated to a performance of breathtaking gall that simply blows you away. There, before your eyes, you see a new standard being set, rendering all prior examples of pandering insignificant by comparison.' 
In other words, this testimony that I just reread and these hearings were pure hypocrisy and set a new standard of hypocrisy. 
I don't think anybody in their right mind could have watched those hearings and not felt some anguish for those who suffered, and welled up support for those who were courageous, and an understanding that something needed to be done and soon. 
Hypocritic pandering? I think not. I think it is a deep-seated problem of public servants who thought they were not accountable and had come to misunderstand, Mr. President, that 
their job is to serve the American people. 
This editorial goes on to say that, obviously, tax collectors are going to be unpopular. In other words, enforcement people are, by nature, going to be unpopular. Are FBI agents unpopular? Are police officers unpopular? No; the Nation is not fearful of fair enforcement; never has been. Are they fearful of unchecked power and intimidation and threats? Yes; all people are wherever they happen to be, including the United States. 
Wherever it exists, it should be rooted out. Time and time again, whenever we are called upon to do so, we should make sure that all Government servants are reminded they work for the American people who are a free people, who are dedicated free people by our Constitution. And from the very beginning, the premise was that we will not be intimidated nor threatened, nor made fearful of our own Government. 
Mr. President, I am going to conclude with that. I think Senator Leahy wants to make a remark or two. 
I yield whatever time is necessary for Senator Leahy to make his remarks and then we will move to recess.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Southside Savannah Raiders baseball team of Savannah, GA deserves recognition for its extraordinary talent and teamwork for its winning the State championship of the 1996 Division A Georgia Recreation and Parks' Twelve and Under Youth Division. The Raiders achieved an impressive record of 53 wins and 3 losses for the year, and secured the League, City, District 2, and Georgia Games titles, as well as second place in the AAU State Tourney, on their way to the championship. 
The All Stars included Joey Boaen, Christopher Burnsed, Brian Crider, Bryan Donahue, Matthew Dotson, Kevin Finnegan, Kevin Edge, Mark Hamilton, Garett Harvey, Bobby Keal, Adam Kitchen, and Daniel Willard. Linn Burnsed, Danny Boaen, and Dana Edge ably coached these young players and instilled in them a winning attitude and a sense of sportsmanship. The team's success can be attributed to the dedication of all of the team members, as well as the parents and countless friends who lent their support. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to acknowledge the Southside Savannah Raiders' successes, and commend the ability and dedication of these champions.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am introducing today, with Senators Landrieu and Dorgan, the Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997, a bill to simplify access to the Federal courts for private property owners whose rights may have been injured by government action. The fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides individuals with protection from having their property taken by the Government. The Constitution requires that when private property is taken for a public purpose, the property owner must be compensated. 
However, property owners seeking protection of their rights are frequently frustrated by endless bureaucratic delay and countless procedural hurdles that prevent them from having their day in court. They are told they must resolve all of their State court remedies and all of their administrative remedies before their case is ripe for a hearing in Federal court. 
Unfortunately, most property owners cannot afford the long and often fruitless process of resolving all possible remedies before their case is ripe. This process can mean years of court battles and tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to win the right to have the merits of the case heard in Federal court. The hurdles are so oppressive that one study concluded less than 6 percent of takings claims filed during the 1980's were ever deemed ripe for Federal court adjudication. 
This unfair result happens because the requirement to exhaust all administrative remedies before getting their day in court subjects property owners to endless rounds of appeals with the relevant agency. However, property owners should be able to know with some degree of certainty what rights they have in their own property. The Property Owners Access to Justice Act says that property owners must try to resolve their differences with the agency in question, but once the agency has denied their appeal or waiver attempt, the property owner has the right to go to court. 
The property owner would still shoulder the burden of proof that he or she has been injured and deserves compensation, but at least the owner will be able to have the merits of the case heard. And there is an end to the process, instead of leaving the property owner in the regulatory limbo of appealing and appealing and appealing before getting the right to seek relief in court. 
To deal with the problem of resolving all State court remedies, this bill essentially gives property owners a choice of how to assert their property rights under the Constitution. If the property owner wants to pursue action against a local or State agency that has infringed on his or her rights, the property owner can sue in State or local court, as he would now. Or, if the property owner wants to reject that route and instead pursue only a fifth amendment takings claim, the case can be heard in Federal court. 
This will correct the current situation in which a property owner can be bounced between State and Federal courts for years, with the merits of their Federal claim never being heard. 
The Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997 is strictly procedural in nature. It does not change substantive law. It does not define a taking or establish a trigger for when compensation is due. It does not give property owners any special access to the Federal courts. On the contrary, it allows property owners the same access to Federal courts that other claimants currently have. Citizens alleging violations of their first amendment rights or fourth amendment rights are not told to resolve their administrative and State court remedies first--they go to Federal court. Property owners deserve to be treated the same as everyone else. 
Mr. President, this bipartisan bill is simply an effort to provide property owners with a less complicated way to have their day in court. It gives them the access to justice and the chance to present the merits of their case that all Americans expect as a matter of simple fairness. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997 and ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be entered in the Record.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this Congress began its deliberations in a very interesting way. Our conference, our side of the aisle, met before the convening of the 105th Congress and concluded or defined 10 major issues they thought should be brought before the Nation. 
The first issue, which resulted in the first piece of legislation for this Senate, for this Congress, was education. It was unanimous agreement in the conference that our first expression in this Congress on our side of the aisle would be about education and its importance. Not long after that the President of the United States announced that education would become a centerpiece of his activities during this Congress, and he actually visited Georgia, he visited various locales across the country, and he talked about, by and large, the requirement or need that people have some relief from the costs of higher education. 
It is interesting, and in a sense in a bipartisan way, we had key leaders in both parties focusing on this issue. It is certainly exactly what ought to have happened. I believe the genesis of American glory is that we have been a free people. I have said more than once that an uneducated people cannot be free. An uneducated people cannot be free. 
So as we, the custodians of this great democracy, prepare for a new century, we have to be asking ourselves the question over and over: Are we preparing the generation that will lead that century with the tools that they will need and require to be ready to do that job? Unfortunately, the news is not altogether comforting when you review the data. 
Despite the intense interest in the last tax relief proposal on costs of higher education, that higher education is not where America is in trouble in its education. America is in trouble in its elementary and high school level. 
I was reading just the other day a prominent survey of the condition in elementary schools. It is fairly alarming. It suggested that 4 out of 10 students in elementary school today are frightened by some aspect or fearful of violence in the school. Mr. President, the survey concluded that 3 out of 10 students in elementary school will have property stolen from them in the schools. It suggested that 1 out of 10 will be confronted with a deadly weapon while they are in school. 
When you look at the condition of our reading proficiency, our basic skills--reading, writing, adding and subtracting--we are not comforted by the data which, of course, has led to this massive debate about skills that students have to achieve by the time they are in the fourth grade, have to achieve by the time they are in the eighth grade, and how are we going to certify that it has happened. 
I have spent the better part of the last 2 years talking about the fact that we have a drug epidemic in the United States, particularly among our younger teenagers. We have seen statistics that show that drug use has doubled in the last 36 to 40 months. These are schoolchildren, Mr. President. If you go to these schools--and I invite anybody to do it--the students are very savvy, they know exactly what is happening, and they know that there are drugs and violence surrounding their environment in school. 
So, 4 in 10 are fearful; 3 in 10 are going to be robbed; 1 in 10 is going to face a weapon; and all of them will tell you the nature of drugs and the availability of drugs. 
Three out of ten who come to college this September will have to take remedial training in reading. In other words, 30 percent-plus of the students that have gone through our elementary school system and our high school system are not ready for college and can't read well. So I guess the story is beginning to frame itself: We have a problem in K through high school. An American family ought to at least expect that when their child graduates from an American high school, they can do the ABC's, they can read, they can write, and they can do their arithmetic, and they are not behind. Society spends millions upon millions of dollars retraining these students by the time they get to college. 
Well, I think this data and these statistics, Mr. President, are the reason that when you poll Americans, the vast majority of them now put education as the No. 1 issue. It is because they are reading the same data that we are reading. And, of course, it is the reason that leadership in both parties have come forward of late and have suggested that we need to make the Federal Government be the appropriate partner--the appropriate partner; not the governor, not the manager, but a good partner--in helping our States and our local communities get a handle on what is going wrong in public education at the elementary and high school level. 
So, as a result, the first bill was introduced, S. 1, which contained three major initiatives. First, there was tax relief making employer-provided educational assistance tax free to help make up this shortfall, help these employers bring new educational opportunity to their employees. That is now law.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have spent the better part of the morning talking about our initiatives to begin to get at the core problems in elementary education in America. We have talked about creating an education savings account that allows every family the opportunity to save and build resources to deal with whatever deficiencies are troubling their children. 
We talked about the Presiding Officer's amendment which would move $11 billion or $12 billion to local school districts without the strings and encumbrances that Washington cannot ever seem to free itself of. Just put the resource at the local level. 
We have talked about a proposal to create scholarships in the District of Columbia to try to allow these families in certifiably troubled schools a way out. 
Three things, all of which are addressed where the real problem in American education is occurring: Elementary and high school. 
Now, what has been the opposition? What is the opposition? It began when the savings account was put in the tax relief proposal. The President told the Speaker that if it was left in the proposal, the savings account for families to help kids in elementary school, he would veto all of it, all the tax relief would be vetoed. 
So obviously it was removed. But we have not retreated. We have brought the proposals back. The Speaker introduced the education savings account on the House side, and myself and the majority leader on this side. 
Now, what is the reason? Why would the President go to such lengths to clamp down on an education savings account? Well, he and the Secretary of Education say it would undermine public education--remove resources from public education. 
Mr. President, I have to assume they are just misinformed by their own staffs. I can come to no other conclusion--that they just have become so accustomed to the status quo and to beating down any new idea that there is a knee-jerk reaction. They always try to infer that these ideas will somehow impair or undermine public education. Wrong, wrong, and wrong. 
In fact, it is the reverse, the exact reverse. The savings account will infuse public education with new money. The vast majority of students are in public schools and the vast majority of students will stay in public schools. The savings accounts that the parents of those children create will come to the aid of--there is not a single dime, Mr. President, not 10 cents, that will be removed from public schools. 
Conversely, billions--billions--of new dollars will come to the support of public schools. The child in a public school who needs a tutor, the child in public school--which, incidentally, will be a public schoolteacher. If I was a public schoolteacher I would be rushing in support of the education savings account because it will give them a vast, vast new opportunity to teach, which they love to do, and earn compensation, which will help them. Not one dime is removed. 
Every family that opens this savings account will continue to pay their property tax for the public school--every one. They will set up the savings account. They will hire tutors from the public school system. They will be tutoring children in the public school system. They will be buying home computers for children in the public school. And if the President's proposal is adopted sometime for uniforms, they will be buying uniforms in the public school system. They will be transporting students to afterschool programs or whatever in the public school system. 
Now, Mr. President, it will also help private schools because those parents that have made that decision can also open up savings accounts, and all the things I have just said that would augment public education will augment private education. 
Now, I guess this is the rub for the President. There will be some families who will use the savings account to change schools. They might leave a troubled school and go to another one, and he doesn't think they should have that right. He can say that. He can say it is good sound public policy for us to order families where they must go to school, but he may not assert that it undermines public schools, because it just isn't true. It is the reverse. It augments and brings vast new resources to all elementary education, public and private. 
As I said when these remarks began, they are going to be the most intelligently spent dollars in all education because they are dollars being directed like a rifle shot to the exact problem the child has. 
Vast public moneys, which do great good, cannot do that; parents do it. And we are giving them the tools to do it. That is a fact, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. As the Senator well knows, Federal funding for the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park highway road relocation project is very important to myself and the State of Georgia. Your previous support for this project has been especially helpful and appreciated. I note that in the fiscal year 1998 Interior Appropriations Committee report, on page 38, it states `that the Park Service intends to allocate $2.8 million in fiscal year 1997 to continue work on the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park highway road relocation project, and that additional funds will be allocated in fiscal year 1999 from Federal Highway Lands Program funds.' In addition, the report also states that `the committee supports efforts to complete this project in fiscal year 1999.' 
I appreciate the subcommittee chairman's interest in this important issue. However, I am concerned that it appears that no funding will be allocated for this project in fiscal year 1998. This has been an ongoing road construction project and any further delay in its completion will cause additional burdens to my State. It is my understanding that the Park Service has made assurances that it will provide at least $8.85 million in fiscal year 1998 from its Federal Highway Lands Program funds. Is the Senator aware of these assurances made by the Park Service?

If the subcommittee chairman would further yield, it is my understanding that the House's version of the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill includes report language which reflects the Park Service's assurance and sets aside a minimum of $8.85 million for this project. I believe it is critical there be no further delays in completion of this project or gaps in funding from the Park Service. Would the chairman be inclined to include language similar to the House in the conference report to the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill?

I can be anything, if I put my mind to it. 
But, if I use drugs I won't have a mind to do anything. 
Drugs Destroy Dreams. 
United we can help Senator Coverdell stomp out drugs in Cordele. 
Mr. President, her comments struck me because they are frank and hard-hitting--if you use drugs, you will not be able to follow your hopes and dreams. 
As we legislate in this body, we must continue to listen to our youth as they convey this message. For after all, they are the ones in which the future, and all of our dreams, lies.

The amendment calls for $5 million in funds to be distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of HHS, and there is no offset. CBO reports that there are no budgetary problems with this amendment. Its score would not result in a budget point of order. 
This amendment, the first section of the amendment provides funding for research on the development of improved medical treatment for patients infected with E. coli. The most vulnerable members of society susceptible to the chronic effects of E. coli infection are children and the elderly. Funding should focus on helping these individuals to recover fully. 
Another section provides funding to help detect and prevent colonization of E. coli in live cattle. Research should focus on determining the host-pathogen relationship between cattle and the E. coli microbe and explore which factors contribute to its incidence in cattle. 
Another section provides funding for the administration's food safety initiative, more directly for the important consumer education component. This national consumer education campaign on food safety represents a partnership between Government, industry and consumer groups. This is an important link in the food safety chain and a critical initiative endorsed last year by former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Education as well. 
Another section would implement a much needed study on the feasibility of irradiating raw red meat to eliminate the E. coli pathogen and to develop a consumer education program on the process of safety. Currently available for poultry products, irradiation is a proven method of confronting this disease, and its feasibility on red meat needs to be explored. 
Finally, a section requires the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to determine the effectiveness of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's zero tolerance standard for E. coli in raw ground beef products and the effectiveness of its current microbiological testing program. An updated report on this testing will be helpful to the Congress, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, consumers and the industry in their search for tools to effectively identify and irradiate E. coli in raw ground beef products. 
Mr. President, this is a very good amendment. It is directed at the long-term and short-term health of every American, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask how much time is remaining.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in response to the good Senator from Arizona, I know he has been long an advocate of nonearmarking, but we just simply disagree on the substance of the amendment. There is no discretion about whether this research will be engaged in or the consumer studies, that is correct, but it is up to the discretion of the Secretary as to how and where that is funded. And that is the difference between us. 
The Senator is wrong in his assertion that $1 million of this would go to Atlanta, GA. It is possible that some of these funds would go to the University of Georgia, although it is not directed. The reason that it is possible, I would say probable, is that unbeknownst to me until very recently but long known in the industry, the University of Georgia has been among the several isolated universities that has advanced research on how to deal with E. coli in the live herds versus the contemporary process of trying to somehow spot this disease and irradiate it in the processing of the meat itself. Indeed, a discovery on this would be at the level of discovering penicillin, and it just happens that that research is highly advanced at this university at a time when this problem is such a focus of the attention of health concerns in the United States.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997, S. 1139, I rise to express my thanks to Senator Bond for his leadership on behalf of small business. As many of us have stated in the Senate, small businesses today face the daunting task each day of meeting their payrolls, providing a quality work environment for their employees, and remaining competitive. All the while, they strive to comply with a myriad of regulations and struggle to satisfy the tax burden government imposes upon them. 
The Committee on Small Business held a hearing earlier this year regarding women-owned business. The committee members heard testimony that, in 1996, women-owned businesses employed 1 out of every 4 workers, totaling 18.5 million employees. Last year, these businesses accounted for an estimated $2.3 trillion in sales. Increasingly, women are becoming small business owners and according to the National Foundation of Women Business Owners, the growth of these women-owned small businesses outpaced overall business growth nearly 2 to 1. In Georgia alone, there are 143,045 women-owned businesses, both full and part-time. Women are a vital force in our economy, and we need to do more to remove the obstacles that are in their way. 
This leads me to think about Carolyn Stradley, a truly remarkable Georgian from Marietta. She offered testimony before the Small Business Committee where she described her experience as an entrepreneur. From humble beginnings, she started and built her own paving business over many significant obstacles. Unfortunately, chief among these obstacles was, and continues to be, the Federal Government. 
I believe support for women-owned small businesses is important. Such entrepreneurship has provided a vital means for many to break the cycle of poverty created and sustained by the welfare state. As we strive for welfare reform, small businesses and entrepreneurship provide an important avenue for many. 
Mr. President, at this point in my statement, I would like to take the opportunity also to thank Senator Bond for his cooperation and sensitivity to the concerns of women-owned small businesses. This legislation before us authorizes the National Women's Business Council with the resources it needs to help women entrepreneurs. I was pleased to have worked with my good friend and fellow Georgian, Senator Max Cleland, in committee to ensure the Council received this critical support.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I also thank Chairman Bond for including S. 925, the Women's Small Business Programs Act of 1997 that I introduced earlier this year, in the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. My proposal will expand the pool of resources available to women-owned small businesses and would allow women business development centers to enter into contracts with other Federal agencies and departments to provide specific assistance to small business concerns. 
Far too often our Government serves as a roadblock to small business men and women. Taxes are too high, regulations are too complex, the costs of doing business are through the roof. It is time we did something to help our Nation's working women.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am only going to speak to this amendment briefly. Let me just say that, at the appropriate time, it will be discovered that this is a rather broadly based amendment to deal with food safety. 
The amendment includes provisions for funding for research in the development of improved medical treatment for patients infected with E. coli and related diseases. 
The amendment provides funding to help detect and prevent colonization of E. coli in live cattle. Research would focus on determining the pathogen relationship between cattle and E. coli. 
The amendment will provide funding for the administration's food and safety initiative and, more directly, for the important consumer education component. 
Mr. President, the amendment provides provisions to implement a much-needed study on the feasibility of a irradiating raw meat to eliminate E. coli and to develop a consumer education program on the process of safety. 
Mr. President, the amendment will require the Department of Health and Human Services to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to determine the effectiveness of USDA's zero-tolerance standard for E. coli. 
I am pleased today to be introducing an important amendment in my capacity as Agriculture Subcommittee chairman with jurisdiction over inspections. I am proposing what I think is a commonsense, effective approach to confronting the deadly pathogen E. coli:0157H7. As we are all aware in Congress, our Nation is facing a difficult battle with this bacteria as we work to assure the safety of our domestic food source. Scientists are confronting traditional difficulties in fighting E. coli on the farm and controlling the toxins it releases once in the body. Looking closely at this issue over the past two weeks, it has become increasingly clear to me that some of the best answers to E. coli and other food safety problems can be found in advanced research, education, and study. The committee report on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill repeatedly calls for greater emphasis on food safety and development of priorities in this field. Consequently, firewalls must be built to prevent, to the greatest extent possible, the growth, transmission, and human health destruction that can be caused by this rare but virulent bacteria. The following amendment takes recommendations, which were issued in the `Final Report of the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Solving the E. coli 0157:H7 Problem' in 1994. This task force was comprised of the experts from the government, industry, academia, and consumer and producer groups. These recommendations are all backed by good science and will help strengthen existing standards and build new safeguards against human exposure to and illness from E. coli 0157:H7. The following is a summary of my amendment:

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is a grave condition in our elementary and secondary schools across the land. Today, 40 percent of our children do not feel safe in school. It's hard to believe, Mr. President, that: 
At least 2.7 million violent crimes take place annually either at or near school. 
Every hour, on school campuses, more than 2,000 students and about 40 teachers are physically attacked. 
One in every nine students said they cut classes or stayed away from school last year to avoid being beaten or shot. 
One in every eight students carries a weapon to school for protection, with 100,000 children taking a gun to school each day. 
Last year, a 12-year-old student at a Los Angeles middle school was raped on campus, during school hours, by another student. The victim was forced to attend alone a school disciplinary hearing for the accused which the offender attended with his parents and his lawyer. The State education code afforded protection for the accused but not for the victims or witnesses. 
Recently, four teenage boys gang raped a 14-year-old girl at a public high school in Queens. The girl reluctantly reported the crime the next day to a school counselor. When she didn't provide enough detail the assistant principal merely referred her back to the counselor. Almost 1 month later the crime was finally reported to law enforcement and the four were arrested. 
A 15-year-old boy killed himself in a GA classroom after being assaulted and bullied almost daily at school because he was overweight. 
Mr. President, we cannot allow our children to continue to be terrorized at school. We cannot ignore these kids who are victimized or who witness their friends being abused. The amendment I am offering today begins to address this problem for those children already facing violence. It will: Require the Secretary of Education to establish a program to provide training and technical assistance to State and local education agencies in developing and implementing procedures to protect victims/witnesses of school crime, including protections associated with school disciplinary hearing, and require the Secretary of Education to utilize $500,000 of the funds appropriated under this bill to award grants for pilot school safety hotlines to provide K-12 students with confidential assistance regarding violence, crime, drugs, and threats to personal safety. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the 52 million children who attend our schools this year, I urge adoption of this amendment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for the hours and hours of deliberation and work to bring us to this point. You are both to be highly commended, along with several others of our colleagues. But I think all of us in the Senate are indebted to the hours of commitment, not only to this distinguished body, but to our country, and we thank you both. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the Tax Relief Act, and I was most pleased to be able to cast a vote earlier today for the Balanced Budget Act. I know many have said so, but it is worthy of repeating. We have waited 28 years to finally have the Congress produce a balanced budget act that will be signed by the President. That is a massive accomplishment. Now we are on the verge of passing, I think by even a greater margin, a tax relief act, which is a significant step. It falls short, in my judgment, of what is truly needed for the American worker and family, but I applaud the significance of it, the direction of it, and even the amount of it. 
I do think it is worth remembering that, in 1990, about this same time of the year, American workers and families were given a $250 billion tax increase. At that time, it was the largest increase in American history. It was followed by a promise, in 1992, of a reduction, which never occurred. In fact, what happened was that another $250 or $260 billion tax increase was given to the American worker and family--meaning that from 1990 to 1993, taxes were raised by over a half trillion dollars, leaving the American worker and American family with the largest tax levy in our history. 
Put in that context, this tax relief is only a 20 percent refund of the tax increases in the early part of this decade. That is why I say it falls short of what I think really ought to occur, and I know I am joined by many colleagues who feel this is a first step and we must come back and find additional relief for the American worker. 
Now, I have said many times on the floor, Mr. President, that I think it is better to try to bring this down to what it really means to an average family. In my State, that family makes about $40,000 a year. When that family pays its current tax burden and when that family pays its share of the cost of Government and when that family pays its share of higher interest rates, they are left with about 47 percent of their paycheck. In other words, this year, they worked from January 1 to July 3 for the Government, which meant that July 4 this year took on a new meaning. It was not only Independence Day; it was the first day they got to keep the first dime of their paycheck. Or, in other terms, it means, in my judgment, if you could conclude that an American family ought to keep, at a minimum, two-thirds of their paycheck--it ought to be more--but if you concluded, at a minimum, that American workers ought to keep two-thirds of their paycheck, that means they are falling $8,000 short--this average family I am talking about--every year. Just think of what that kind of resource would do for that average family's checking account and the kinds of things they could do. 
You know, we are always hearing, and we are told over and over that American families have no savings. Why would we be surprised that they have no savings, Mr. President, if the Government has been marching through their checking account taking over half of what they have? The disposable income that is left can barely deal with the essentials. Why are we surprised that consumer debt is at an all-time high or that individual bankruptcies are at an all-time high or why, in the face of a reasonably good economy, there is still so much anxiety in middle America? It is because we have left them with so few resources to do the job we have always asked of the American family. 
As somebody said the other day on the floor, the best department of health and human services is our own American family. But they have to have the resources, instead of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
So, Mr. President, the fact that we are refunding about $100 billion of the $500 billion in new taxes is a laudable step and a meaningful step that will help every generation of Americans--children through the child tax credits, students through the savings accounts for education and the tax credit, small businesses and owners of stock and people in retirement or who are about to go into retirement because of the capital gains tax reduction and the estate tax improvements. We are going to move a flood of capital to the newest ideas because we are going to unlock billions of dollars when we lower the tax burden on capital. 
So, Mr. President, I applaud our leadership. I applaud the members of the Finance and Budget Committees. I applaud the President for finally agreeing to sign meaningful tax relief and a balanced budget act. I believe this is good for America. 
I have one disappointment. Mr. President, after agreeing to the tax proposal, the President sent a late-night letter to our leadership and said that he would veto all the tax relief for America if we include an amendment which we passed in the Senate which would have granted a savings account for families to use for elementary education and high school education. That is where the problem with American education exists. This amendment would have allowed average families the ability to remove from the savings account, without being taxed, money to buy equipment, like computers, to hire tutors for special education needs, for special transportation costs, and, yes, for tuition, if they chose another school to go to. I think it is a severe loss that that amendment had to be removed. I am here to say to the Senate and to the House and to the President that the millions of Americans who want assistance at the elementary and secondary level are not going to go away. We will come back. We will author new legislation to achieve these goals focusing on elementary and secondary education. It is going to be a requirement if we are going to produce the knowledge in our youth that will be able to lead us into the new century. 
So, Mr. President, with that, I conclude my remarks and yield back my time to the leader.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Double Postage Rule Elimination Act of 1997. This legislation will protect consumers by eliminating the double postage rule under which the Postal Service requires its competitors to charge above market prices. 
We have in effect today laws known as the Private Express Statutes or PES. These laws make it generally unlawful for any person other than the Postal Service to send or carry letters over postal routes for compensation, with some exceptions. Under the PES, private delivery companies must set their two-day delivery rates at twice those of the Postal Service for similarly sized items. 
In addition, the PES gives the Postal Service the right to impose fines on businesses that use private delivery companies to deliver time-sensitive mail rather than using the Postal Service. Current regulations permit a business to choose a private carrier--such as UPS, Federal Express, or others--if the business feels that the message is urgent. The catch is that the Postal Service feels it alone can determine if a message is truly urgent, not the consumer. 
Currently, the Postal Service charges $3.00 per item for its Priority Mail, which is advertised as reaching the recipient in two days, though that isn't guaranteed. This means the lowest price a private competitor can offer for two-day delivery is $6.00. If the Postal Service raised its rate by $1.00 to $4.00 an item, a private delivery company offering $6.00 service would have no choice but to impose a $2.00 increase, to $8.00. 
As you can see, the law gives the Postal Service great power to control the rates charged by its private competitors and limit competition. Combine that with the Postal Service's ability to second-guess a consumer's decision to use a private carrier and you have a very uneven playing field. 
The Postal Service has displayed a willingness to use its governmental powers for competitive advantage. In 1993 it was reported that the Postal Service had audited corporations and fined them as much as $500,000 in back postage fees for using UPS and Federal Express when the Postal Service inspectors thought those choices were not warranted. 
More recently, the Postal Service spent over $200 million on an advertising campaign for Priority Mail. The campaign was based on the Postal Service's lower price--$3.00 for Priority Mail versus $6.00 for UPS and $8.00 for Federal Express. Of course, the ads left out the fact that the private companies were prohibited by law from matching the Postal Service price--or charging anything less than $6.00 a letter. 
Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today does one simple thing to level the field of competition. It replaces the double postage rule with a `two-dollar' rule. Under my bill, private companies will be able to legally charge any rate above $2.00 for their second-day products. If they want to match the Postal Service at $3.00, they may. The law will no longer impose an artificial `double postage' rule forcing private companies to charge above market rates. 
This legislation will stop government intrusions into private consumer decisions and will increase competition in the area of delivering urgent letters. I urge support for the Double Postage Rule Elimination Act of 1997.

Mr. COVERDELL. The city of Atlanta and Hartsfield International Airport have requested a $150 million letter of intent, commonly referred to as an LOI, from the FAA in connection with the construction of a commuter runway. Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport is the second busiest airport in the country and a critical link in our national air transportation system. A major airline headquarted in Atlanta alone has over 600 flights per day out of Atlanta. Over the past several years, there has been an increase in delays at the airport. When Atlanta has a problem with congested air traffic, the effects ripple throughout the national system. Delays at Hartsfield create waves of delay across the country. I strongly believe this project should receive priority consideration from the FAA for an LOI and would ask the chairman and the ranking member, the senior Senator from New Jersey, to support this request.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have just returned from my home State and I can certify that the issue of a balanced budget act and tax relief is on the minds of a lot of Americans. Everywhere I went, whether it was stepping out for lunch or meeting with various groups, somebody would come up and say: Get this done. Hold firm. Stay the course. 
America wants this to happen. America wants a balanced budget act to pass and be signed by the President. It will be the first one in nearly 30 years. That is hard to believe, that we have so abused our financial health that this will be the first balanced budget we will be passing in 30 years. And they want the tax relief. I don't think I have met a citizen that didn't, in some way, start calculating, like the young county commissioner I met who is a farmer and a full-time county commissioner, and he has two children. He said, `If that measure passes, that's going to save my family $1,000, $500 per child.' Or the elderly couple who are concerned about maybe selling their home and relocating, who are concerned about the capital gains tax that currently rests against that property. Or the family that talked about the onerous nature of death taxes in America, the kinds of decisions and pressures it puts on small businesses and family farms. They really do want this done. I hope, as I said last week, the President will set aside the partisan nature of this issue, and trying to one-up somebody else, and just get it done. 
I was reading in today's Washington Post, it says: 
Congressional Republican leaders said last night they were on the verge of a final budget and tax agreement with the White House after making a major concession on the proposed $500-per-child family tax credit and dropping their insistence on `indexing' a reduction in the capital gains tax. 
Or, in the New York Times, Monday, July 28: 
Budget Deal Down To `Small Issues,' Gingrich Declares. Spokesman for President Says Assessment Is Premature--Meetings Continue. 
This is something that both the leaders of our House and Senate and President should really come forward on, get it done, and make a statement that we have, in a bipartisan way, produced major policy. I would revisit, once again, the fact that if the leadership of both parties in the Senate, the leadership of the Finance Committee, both parties, the leadership of the Budget Committee, both parties, if they all could find a balanced budget act and a tax relief act on which they could agree, it ought to send a pretty powerful message to the President and his administration. Remember that 73 Members of the Senate, a majority of both parties' conferences, voted for the Balanced Budget Act, and 80 of them voted for the Tax Relief Act. 
I don't know what more proof you could have that these proposals are well-founded, evenly distributed, and essentially fair. Perfect? No. That's not possible in this environment. But anything that can get that kind of support of the leadership, as I said, of both parties, that is a powerful statement and I hope the President would take note of it. 
I would like to take just a few minutes and put these two major pieces of legislation in context. I think it would explain why somewhere between 60 and 75 percent of the American public wants this to happen. Let's just go back to the beginning of this decade, 1990. In 1990, under the Bush administration, a historically high tax increase was passed in August 1990. In round numbers, about $250 billion of new tax burden were put on American workers and their families. A lot of people feel that had much to do with President Bush being defeated in the following election, in 1992. I think there were a lot of issues involved, but many feel that was the turning point. 
On top of that, his opponent, soon-to-be-President Clinton, was campaigning across the country that he was going to lower taxes, pointing to that tax increase of 1990. `The middle class needs a break,' he said. He was elected in 1992 and came to Washington as the new President. However, before he had moved into the White House, he had discarded that promise, and, by August 1993, in his first year in office, instead of lowering taxes on the middle class, he raised them. He raised taxes to an all-time--in an all-time historical--in the size of the tax increases, it was even larger than the previous one which occurred in the Bush administration. It was over $250 billion. So, between 1990 and 1993, the American workers and their families suddenly were carrying a half a trillion in new taxes, and they were paying the highest tax levels they had ever paid. 
It is little wonder there is so much anxiety in middle America and their families. Even with the economy in reasonably good shape, the enthusiasm is less than wondrous. I decided 
about 2-years ago to take a look at that family. That family in Georgia, and I think this would be true in most of our States, earned about $40,000 a year in gross income. Typically, both parents work today, as you know. And when President Clinton came to Washington, they were only keeping about 53 percent of their paychecks. After they paid for State taxes, local taxes, and Federal taxes, cost of Government and their share of higher interest rates because of a $5.4 trillion national debt, they were keeping 53 cents on the dollar. Unfortunately, today they are only keeping 47 cents on the dollar. The decline in their disposable income marches on. 
These families, in my view, have been pressed to the wall, and we have made it exceedingly difficult for these families to do what we have always depended on the American family to do, that is, educate, house, provide for health, transportation, get the country up in the morning and off to work and school, and prepare their families and children for stewardship when it is their time to lead. In a situation where they are paying more in taxes than housing, education, and food combined, we have a problem in America. If the forefathers were here and could see what we have been confiscating and taking out of the checking accounts, and taking away from those who earned their income, they would be stunned. They would think this was a violation of the essential premises upon which the Nation was founded, which included economic freedom. 
Let me put this in another context. My mother and father, born in 1912 and 1916, kept 80 percent of their lifetime paychecks to do the things I mentioned a moment ago: raise the family--me and my sister--educate, house, provide for health and prepare for stewardship. My sister is 10 years younger than I. She will keep about 50 percent of her lifetime paycheck, and her daughter, my niece, who has just begun her career under the current scheme of things, will only keep about a third of her lifetime paychecks. 
My niece is not going to be free, by the American definition I understand, if 70-plus percent of her paycheck is going somewhere else and she is left with a third of the money she earns to do her job in life. Her options have been severely constrained from those of her grandmother and grandfather. Those options that my dad and my mom had are the very things that made America what it is. 
My dad began his career as a coal truck driver. Had he been born in the sphere of the Soviet bloc, I am convinced he would have died a coal truck driver. But, instead, he lived a life of entrepreneurial spirit and dreams and visions, creating businesses and jobs, the very things that economic freedom have done for our country. The genesis of all American glory is our freedom, and one of the cornerstones of that freedom is economic freedom, economic choices that families and workers in America can make that families and workers in many countries around the world could not. 
Which brings me to the point I am trying to make about the importance of this tax relief proposal. Keep in mind what I said a moment ago. In 1990, $250 billion in new taxes were laid on the backs of American workers and families. In 1993, though promised tax relief, they got another $250 billion in taxes. So we now have, in 3 years, a half a trillion in new taxes. This proposal we are talking about is really only a first step. The net tax relief is $85 billion and you have to stand that against the $500 billion new tax burden. 
It really only represents relief of about 20, 25 percent of the taxes that have been put on the backs of these people in the last 36 months. 
In the last Congress, the new Republican majority tried to refund the President's tax increase. We sent the President a tax relief package, about $245 billion, but he vetoed it. So he kept that tax burden in place and on the back of every worker and every working family. 
We have been through another election. We had a President who said the era of big Government is over. We had a Republican majority in the Senate and the House committed to reining in the size of Government, committed to balancing our budgets, committed to lowering taxes and, finally, the convergence of these two agree to a minimalist--what this is--a minimalist tax relief. But nevertheless, it is moving in the right direction. It is moving in the right direction, and it will be significant to millions of American families. I hope that it is but the first step and that a healthier economy would produce yet a new opportunity to lower the tax burden. 
From my perspective, a worker in America ought to, at a minimum--at a minimum--keep two-thirds of their paycheck. Just two-thirds. It ought to be more. Getting to a position where they can keep two-thirds is a herculean task. They are currently keeping 47 to 50. On an average basis, that means this Congress, this President ought to be working to keep $8,000 per year--$8,000 per year--in the checking account of every average family across America. 
Just think what those families could do with that resource in the context of education, health insurance, housing, recreation, savings. American families don't save anything. They can't save for the rainy day. They can't save for education upfront. They are having a hard time saving for retirement. 
What can you save, Mr. President, after the Government has marched through your checking account and walked off with over half of it? Talk about freedom. I sort of look at it this way. If somebody marches through my checking account and takes over half of what I earn, they--it--has more to do with my life than I do. In family after family across our land, that is what is happening today, and that is why this tax relief proposal is on target and correct, and the President needs to come forward, meet, as is being endeavored here of the leadership of the Congress trying to meet him halfway--just like what happened between the Democrat and Republican leadership here in the Senate --and get this done. Get this done for those average checking accounts and start finding a way to get that $8,000 back into the average checking account of the average working family across our country. 
There is one feature in the Senate proposal that we sent across to the House. We added it in the debate here. As you know, the President has called for $35 billion of the tax relief should be in tax advantages that occur against tuition and higher education and tax credits that occur for families who have students in higher education. That is a huge piece of the $85 billion, I might add. He and his colleagues are arguing that this tax relief for families that have students in higher education is the most important component of it, in his mind. 
There are some critics of that. I can support that, because it at least is leaving those dollars in the checking accounts of those families. I personally believe it should be broader based. I think if a family wants that tax relief to buy a new home, if a family wants that tax relief to deal with other problems--health--they ought to have the option. It ought not to be just tax relief only if you are a family that has a child confronting the cost of higher education. That is fine, too, but it ought to have been broader. But in the series of compromises with the President, we will probably come very close to honoring his request. 
In my view, while cost of higher education is critical, the problem in American education is in grades 1 through 12. It is at the elementary level. It is in high school. Look at the data. Somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of the students coming to college this September will not be able to read proficiently. 
Look at the comparison of our reading skills, our math skills, our science skills against the other industrialized nations. And I am talking about the students that are coming out of our elementary and secondary schools getting ready for college, and we don't look very well. Everybody knows it. We are at the bottom of the list time and time again. One through 10, we will be 10. 
So I think the President's proposal was weak on the failure to address issues at the elementary level, and I offered an amendment, along with our colleagues, which said that the savings accounts that were created also for higher education, in the version that came from the Senate Finance Committee, said you could take after-tax dollars, up to $2,000, and put them in a savings account and the buildup would be tax-free. 
So when you took it out to pay for costs of higher education, you would not pay taxes on the interest that had 
accrued. That is a good idea. But my amendment took it down to grade one and said you could use the buildup to pay for costs associated with elementary and high school. We said you could take it out for home schooling. We said you could take it out for transportation. We said that you could take it out for computers or tutoring. We said you could take it out for tuition. If you, the family, decided that you wanted your child to go to some other type of school, you could use these funds to help pay for that. 
If you put the maximum contribution in, by the time the child was ready for first grade, you would have $15,000 in that account to help deal with decisions that were important to that family regarding education at the elementary level and high school level. 
Mr. President, the administration has voiced concerns about this, and they are beyond me. What would be the logic of denying a family the opportunity to have this savings account and to draw on it for computers, home schooling, tutoring, transportation, or tuition? I find it most difficult to understand how we could object to that at the elementary and high school level. 
Do we not have confidence in these parents that they can make decisions about how to improve the situation for their children at the level of education that is certifiably the most troubling in America, that is producing data that has every American across our land worried and bothered, that we are not competing at this level with students of the industrialized nations around the world? Why wouldn't we want to focus, why wouldn't we allow that tax credit to go into a savings account once it has been put in place, which you could also add to this savings account? 
Mr. President, as I said, there have been objections raised regarding this very simple and, I think, straightforward and clean proposal. I am pleased to say that as of the hour of 4:30 on Monday, July 28, after a series of conferences, first between the Senate and the House to come to a congressional agreement, which has been done and that is important--the House and Senate have met and concurred and they have agreed that this position shaped by the Senate should be in the congressional proposal, and it is. I thank the conferees, and I thank the Speaker, in particular, for fighting to keep this proposal in the mix. 
So we are now down to a point that the only opposition to this concept would be the President, who would be, I guess, saying it's not a good idea for families to be able to have savings accounts that accrue resources that would allow families to make prudent decisions about how to help students, their children, confront the one arena in American education that is so troubling, that is having so much difficulty, that is sending youngsters to college who are having trouble with the basic skills of reading and writing and arithmetic. The ABC's, the things that every student who is going to be successful in college, who is going to be successful in their career must know. We are not getting that job done. This is but a small step in allowing this kind of opportunity or this one more option, one more ability to deal with this troubling arena in American education. 
So I am very hopeful, and I call on the President and his administration to agree to the education IRA to be used for a child's education, grades 1 through 12, and leave this in the tax relief package that we hope will ultimately be done and hopefully done this week. 
What a great message to send America as it enters into the final month of the vacation summer to begin the aggressive era of the fall to say, `We, the Congress and the President, came together and have secured a balanced budget the first time in 3 decades, and we, Congress and the President, have obtained a tax relief act first in a decade and a half.' 
It would be a powerful message to send to our country and the world at this time. 
I have a little bit more to say about that, but I see that we have been joined by the distinguished Senator from Washington. And I yield as much time as the Senator requires to comment on these subjects of balanced budgets and taxes.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we had a very unfortunate story appear in the Washington Post this morning by Helen Dewar. 
The first paragraph: 
President Clinton had `some choice words' about the pace of Senate action on administration nominations during a Wednesday night meeting with Senate Democrats. 
And then it quotes our distinguished minority leader: 
Daschle estimated there are 30 ambassadorial nominations awaiting action for countries that, according to a Senate list, include Britain, France, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and, as of Tuesday, Mexico. 
This is ill-placed and irresponsible criticism and does not serve the efficient management of these nominations. I read the article while I was conducting a hearing that we had hurried to deal with the nomination of the Ambassadors for Guyana and Paraguay. I have just left a meeting with the potential nominee for Ambassador to France, and I spent the better part of the last month doing everything we might do to get our Ambassador to Canada, which, I might add, has been without an ambassador for over a year and a half. We just received the nomination for that Ambassador on July 2--July 2--of this year. The vacancy began in April 1996--Canada. And there have been extended vacancies in Germany, Moscow, et cetera. 
To clarify, this year, we have had 56 nominations received by the Foreign Relations Committee; 14 have been confirmed, 9 are pending on the Executive Calendar; 33 are pending in the committee. That sounds like a lot. But the issue is, 26 of the 44 we have just received in the last month. I repeat, there are 44 pending in the committee; 26 of them we have just gotten. 
The problem here is not in the Senate, nor is it in the Foreign Relations Committee. The problem with ambassadorial nominations is at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
I point out that Tokyo has been vacant since December, and we have no nominee. South Korea has been vacant since December, and we have no nominee. These are not just incidental relationships, I might add. We are talking about Japan and South Korea. 
So, Mr. President, I think those were unfortunate words, and they paint an improper and inappropriate picture, and they do not help anything. I assume they are just ill-informed. But when you are going to make accusations of this kind, and you are the President of the United States, the word travels far. I think it would be more prudent to have your own description of the condition before you start hurling spears, because this kind of thing only confuses the process and makes the work of both the Senate and the administration much more complicated. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise in part to join my colleagues' reflections on what we heard this morning from the other side of the aisle and what we have been hearing basically as a definitional exercise from the White House in their attempts to define the congressional tax relief proposal and the congressional balanced budget act proposal. 
I am encouraged in that it does appear we are making very rapid progress with regard to these two historic bills--a balanced budget act, which if signed by the President will be the first time in about 30 years, and the tax relief act, which if signed by the President would be the first in over a decade and a half. And, as has been noted here this morning, that following massive tax increases over the last 10 years. 
To put this in some sort of historical perspective, I have only been here a short period of time, as has the Presiding Officer, and it has been a rather dramatic 4 years. Half the time was under the congressional leadership of the other side and half the time has been under our side, 2 years each, and they make an interesting comparison. 
In the first 2 years under their side, we fought and lost the largest tax increase in American history. I remember the night very vividly. The Chair of the evening was Vice President Gore, who cast the vote to secure the victory for this huge tax increase, which was characterized by the Senator from Minnesota. The following year was spent, Mr. President, defending the Nation from Government-run health care which would have been the single largest expansion of Government in the history of the world. It would have surpassed the size of Social Security in 24 months, become the largest entitlement in the history of the world. 
Well, the American people prevailed and by the narrowest of margins that was defeated. 
So those 2 years were filled with large tax increases, large expansion of Government, and the view that Government was the ultimate solution and resolution to all America's needs and woes. 
Now we come to the last 2 years. The leadership changed, and the discussion has been about balancing our budget, lowering the economic burden on American workers and families and restraining the size and growth of the Federal Government. 
And we are making progress, because we now have a President who has said the era of big Government is over and he has said he wants to support a balanced budget act and a tax relief act. And we have agreed on the general premises. We are getting very close now to crossing the `t' and dotting the `i.' 
I hope the President will come forward in a spirit of cooperation that was exemplified by what happened on these measures in the U.S. Senate. To watch the leadership of both parties vote for a balanced budget act and a tax relief act, to watch the leadership of the committees of jurisdiction on both sides, the Finance Committee and the Budget Committee, all vote for the balanced budget act and the tax relief act, and then, in almost unprecedented behavior, to have 73 of our 100 colleagues vote for the Balanced Budget Act and 80 join hands and vote for the Tax Relief Act--in all this debate about whether or not it is a fair form of tax relief, I would suggest the empirical evidence that it is is the fact that the leadership of both parties in the Senate and that 80 Members of the Senate could vote for this substantive piece of policy. It is just inconceivable, given that bipartisan, broad, huge majority, that the legislation could be anything less than fair. It almost demonstrates its broad nature and evenhandedness, to secure that kind of support. The President should take note of this. 
The country needs to balance its budgets and American workers need relief. An average family in my State, and I would say across the country, makes in the range of $40,000, often with both parents working, and after they pay their direct taxes and their cost of Government and their share of higher interest rates because of the huge national debt, because we have not had balanced budgets, they have barely half of their paychecks left to provide for their families. If the Founding Fathers were here today and discovered that Government in America had come to the point that it was taking over half the wealth of our workers away from them, they would be stunned. And I think they would be angered. 
What this boils down to is that we are taking about $8,000 a year out of every average family's checking account, and we are making it very difficult for them to provide their fundamental responsibilities, which are getting the country up in the morning and raising it and getting it ready for stewardship. They can barely get that done because of Government policy removing those resources. This legislation goes in the right direction. It does not go as far as it should, I agree with the Senator from Minnesota, but it goes in the right direction. It equates to a refund of that last tax increase of about a third of it. We tried to refund all of it last year, but the President vetoed that. So he has now agreed to refunding about a third of it, and that is good policy. I am very hopeful that the White House will not politicize, `partisanize,' seek political gain and advantage over this policy for which so many on both sides of the aisle have come to agree in the Congress. 
This is the right thing to do for America, and this is the time to do it.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will not be supporting the Dodd-McCain amendment, but I wanted to make several observations about the situation we are facing this evening. 
First, I want to commend Senator Dodd of Connecticut for his extended interest in this subject, for his cooperation and longstanding work on the matter. I am an admirer of his work. I believe, however, that this is not the way to close the circle on the long, extended debate on certification and that process. 
As chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee, I promised to hold hearings on the issue. As Senator Dodd knows, I have long said there are real questions about this process that need airing. I have to say I am somewhat disappointed by General McCaffrey and NSC Adviser Berger coming forward in this manner without a thorough discussion. I worked extensively, along with Senators Dodd, Kerry, McCain, Hutchison, and others, when this became so contentious before, and I think we ought to have had more notice with regard to their views on this than we have had. 
I want to point out that the certification process has had successes, as Senator Kerry has pointed out, and it has created issues and problems, as Senator Dodd has pointed out. There have been benefits and there have been problems. The idea of shutting the process down without a fix on where we are going to go bothers me. Senator Dodd and I have talked about an alliance. Well, maybe that would be an appropriate new place to go. But to just stop what we are doing without knowing where that new place is and in this manner, I don't think is appropriate. 
Mr. President, the certification process is not only about other governments. It has been a tool for the Congress to be at the table on these issues with our own executive branch. In fact, in the long debate over certification of Mexico, it did 
result in this letter from the President to myself and Senator Feinstein, and it makes an extensive outline. 
It says: 
I want to keep the Congress informed of the progress we are making toward achieving the objectives set forth in my 1997 national drug control strategy and the U.S.-Mexico alliance against drugs. Director McCaffrey will provide further details on these issues to Members of both Houses in the near future. My administration will also provide the Congress, by September 1, [that is this September] 1997, a report covering each of the issues contained in the Senate Resolution passed in March as elaborated in your recent letter and discussions with my administration. 
In other words, through the discussions about the process, the administration has told the Congress it is going to come with a full report and present it to the Congress in just a month and a half. It strikes me that we ought to see the report, hold the hearing, and then see what it points us toward--not just suddenly come forward and end the process before we have had the report. I have to say, Mr. President, if it were not for the process, I doubt we would have ever gotten this letter. 
The last point I make is, I just came from a hearing, a portion of which Senator Dodd was able to attend, but he had to return to the floor. The discussions by the various witnesses were exceedingly alarming. They described, on our border, armed conflict. They described drug cartels operating in military fashion--not a bunch of hooligans--with the most sophisticated equipment, semiautomatic weapons, night goggles and sophisticated communication systems that allowed them to ambush our own agents. The testimony alluded to a growing number of occurrences, already 70 this year, of similar incidences--armed assault on U.S. Border Patrol, targeted agents, assassination threats. 
Senator McCain is correct, the status quo is not working. I believe the correct response is to hear from the administration as they promised, to hold our public hearings, to air the various ideas and concepts, and then come forward in an organized, methodical manner and hear where we go in the future. Senator Dodd and I agree completely that the status quo is unacceptable. We are just not quite on the same time line as to where we go from here. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, the certification process is not perfect. The Foreign Relations Committee has committed to hearings on this. That is the appropriate venue to discuss it. We should not suspend the process without the new place to go or the new system being in order. We send the wrong message at the wrong time, and I urge my colleagues not to suspend and leave no system in place.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the McCain amendment purports to create another series of base realignment closure commissions. I am opposed to that and have so stated and have so advised the Secretary of Defense. I do not believe there should be another Base Realignment Closure Commission until the administration can certify to the Congress that all the work of the previous Base Realignment Closure Commissions has occurred and properly. 
Many of us, particularly in the States affected by Air Force depots, believe the President and the administration undermined BRAC and undermined the confidence in the people and the Congress with regard to its integrity, because essentially the President overrode the 1995 BRAC recommendations, in our judgment, particularly as they relate to Kelly Air Force Base in Texas and McClellan Air Force Base in California. That is in dispute. I certainly acknowledge the comments and characterizations that have been made by the good Senators from Texas and California. 
But this issue must be resolved and it must restore the confidence of the Congress and it must reassert an integrity into the process for the people who undergo this horrendous process, that the legislation has to apply to the President, the administration and the Department of Defense, not just to the people in Congress. 
I rise in opposition to the McCain amendment and in support of the second-degree amendment offered by Senators Dorgan, Lott and Daschle. 
I yield any remaining time back to the managing Senator.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the bill currently provides an education IRA for college expenses only. But, of course, not every child goes to college. Every child does, however, attend elementary and secondary school. 
This amendment expands the education IRA to allow parents to use it for any education expenses, including tuition from kindergarten through high school. I am pleased to be joined on this amendment by Senators Abraham, Coats, Craig, Santorum, and Ashcroft. 
Mr. President, it is important to help parents cope with the cost of college, but that is not where the crisis is. The crisis in our schools is in elementary and secondary schools that are riddled with drugs and violence. Let's do something to help those parents, too. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are in the midst of a great deal of history in the 105th Congress. As most people now realize early out, the Congress, the leadership of the Congress and the President of the United States and his administration reached an agreement that they would work together to produce, finally, after well over a decade, tax relief, and that we would produce by the year 2002 a balanced budget which would, of course, by definition, produce constrained spending, and that we would take steps to protect the solvency of Medicare at least for upward to a decade, and begin to reduce spending in order to reach these balanced budget goals. 
By and large, I believe the American people are pleased with the concept of this agreement. I suspect that not all of them realize that was only one step in a 1,000-mile journey, and that once those basic parameters had been established then you had to begin the business of having the committees of jurisdiction produce the actual legislation that would produce this effect. 
Mr. President, this has been a long goal of the Republican majority of this Congress that came here in 1994, to produce balanced budgets and to produce tax relief for America's families and workers that we believe are under the most severe economic pressure in contemporary history. They are paying more taxes. An average family is paying higher taxes today than at any time in contemporary history. 
This agreement comes in the context of a longstanding battle between this Congress and the President. I am going to take just a moment or two to remind us of the general milestones in that battle. In 1992, 5 years ago, when the President was first seeking election, he promised the American people, particularly the middle class, that he would lower their taxes, that if he were elected President, he was going to reduce the economic tax pressure on middle-class America. In August of 1993, in his first year of the Presidency, that promise to lower taxes became, in reality, the largest tax increase in American history. I repeat, the promise to lower taxes was fulfilled by raising taxes to the highest level in American history. 
Then came the elections of 1994 and the American public said, `Now, wait a minute here. We were told we were going to have tax relief, and our tax bill has gone up. We were told that American Government would shrink, and we just witnessed the single largest proposal to enlarge the Federal Government in American history.' 
So we had the largest tax increase, which passed by one vote--that of the Vice President, seated in the very chair that the Presiding Officer occupies right now, and that was followed by a suggestion that we should expand the Federal Government to take over every aspect of health care, which was narrowly defeated. 
So in 1994, the American public sent new leadership to the Congress, and they turned the Congress over after three decades of dominance by the other party, and they elected a new majority. 
The new Congress, Mr. President, designed a balanced budget, reduced the size of the Federal Government, reduced Federal spending, and offered to lower taxes by the equivalent amount of money that the President had raised taxes. He raised taxes in 1993 by about $250 billion, and the new Congress came in and lowered taxes by $245 billion. So what it in effect was was a refund of that galloping tax increase that hit the American public in 1993. 
That went to the President and the President took his pen and struck it down. He vetoed the tax relief, he vetoed the balanced budget, and he vetoed all the constraints that were represented in the balanced budget. Now, even though it was vetoed, it was a historic achievement because it was the first time in over 30 years that a Congress proved that it could, indeed, muster the courage and the muscle to pass a balanced budget and at the same time lower working families' taxes. But it was vetoed. 
Now we have two major events that have occurred here--in 1993, taxes were raised to historical levels; in 1995, the Congress tries to refund that and the President vetoes it. 
We have another election. The President is reelected and he is reelected under the theme: The era of big Government is over; the era of big Government is over. The Congress is reelected in the House and the Senate, the Congress that was 
committed to balanced budgets and tax relief. The leadership of this Congress and the newly elected President, for his second term, decided to sit down, and they had historical meetings, both in the Capitol and at the White House, and they announced a historical agreement that both will work for a balanced budget, for tax relief and constrained spending. 
Last night, the Senate Finance Committee passed to the full floor of the Senate a proposal that honors the agreement for tax relief in the range of $135 billion. That tax relief is not enough, but keep in mind it is an agreement between an institution--the White House is not all that enamored with tax relief per the discussion we just had--and a Congress that would like it to be substantially more. At the end of the day, the proposal that will be coming to the Senate floor will be about a refund equivalent of about 40 percent of that tax increase that was put in place by the President in 1993. So it is very meaningful and very significant. 
Just to remind the American public--no one can see this chart, but it goes from 1950 to 1997, and you can see the trend. The percentage of the Nation's wealth consumed by taxes has gone from 23.4 to almost 32 percent--up, up, up, and up. 
This proposal that we will have coming before us is the first in well over a decade that would significantly lower that burden. A little later on in my remarks I will talk further about the condition of the average family, but we will take a moment and talk about some of the details of this tax relief. First of all, Mr. President, it is for kids. This is tax relief for children. The $500 per child tax credit will help parents--that is per child--will help parents meet the needs of children and teenagers. We figure teenagers probably have the highest economic impact on the family than even the real little ones, and that is the difference between us and the President. The President's proposal does not include tax relief for teenagers, but we do and this proposal does. So it is a $500 per child tax credit to help parents meet the needs of children and teenagers because parents can decide their children's needs better than Washington bureaucrats. 
We are leaving the money in their checking account, not dragging it up here and then micromanaging it as to what is important in that family. Obviously, it is for the parents of these children. We make it easier in this tax relief for parents to afford their children's higher education by building on the President's Hope education proposal and improving it. We make it easier for parents to save and to invest for their own future by expanding IRA's and including a homemaker IRA that will help either mothers at home or working mothers. 
This is a plan for the grandparents in their retirement years. Those who have worked hard and played by the rules and saved for retirement should be rewarded, not punished, as is the current law. Some say, on the other side of the aisle, you are rich--which is often characterized in an uncomplimentary fashion. I am also often amused by what is considered wealthy, and you do not have to have much to be targeted as being a wealthy person in America around this Washington establishment. On the other side of the aisle they say you are rich if you put money into mutual funds or contributed to a company retirement plan or built a small business with your own sweat and labor, 
or run your own farm. An average farmer would be categorized as rich, according to the other side of the aisle. 
More than half of all taxpayers claiming capital gains have incomes under $50,000. I want to repeat that. More than half of all taxpayers who claim capital gains have incomes of less than $50,000, and most, or many, are seniors who live a better life by converting their lifelong investments. Over the years, as we have heard argument after argument against lowering the tax on capital gains, we have heard time and time again that that is just something for wealthy people; that is just something for rich people. 
I repeat: More than half of all who claim capital gains earn less than $50,000 a year. 
Mr. President, I have noted the arrival of the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who has played just a massive role in these agreements and has been following the details of their fulfillment in great detail. I yield up to 15 minutes of our time--unless he needs more--to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.

I would make one comment. And then I am going to yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah. 
When you talk about savings, in my judgment, the force that has more to do with destroying savings is Uncle Sam. When something marches through an average person's checking account and takes over half, as they do today--a 45-percent tax is the cost of Government, and higher interest rates because of the deficit--there isn't anything left to save in an average family. You can look at every data and see exactly what has happened as we ratchet up the amount that the Government takes out of that checking account. We closed savings accounts all over the country. Until we start moving resources, as the Senator described, for New Mexico back into their savings accounts, we are never going to have them open savings accounts.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, amendment No. 423 is language in the DOD authorization bill that would have the effect, in the judgment of the Senators that coauthored it from Georgia and Oklahoma--and I am pleased that Senator Cleland, my colleague from Georgia and a member of the Armed Services Committee, has coauthored the amendment--this language would, in our minds, have the effect of concluding and carrying out what we believe were the findings of the last round of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. 
Because of the structure of the unanimous consent, it is designed to encourage the Senators of the States so enumerated in the unanimous consent to work arduously to try to resolve the differences that currently exist between our separate views of what the final Base Realignment and Closure Commission was and how it was carried out. It is a strong statement, following the lead of the good Senator from Oklahoma, who has been in pursuit of this issue for an extended period of time. Of course he is the principal author of the amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, according to the unanimous consent agreement.

Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Oklahoma can be assured that he will have my undevoted attention to accomplishing this because not only have we lost half a billion dollars because the Base Realignment and Closure Commission was voided by the administration, we have lost the integrity of the discipline itself. It should never occur again in that form. 
I suspect there will be a debate on that on this bill. The Base Realignment and Closure Commission has been sullied because it was a strict discipline that the people, the citizens of the country had to live by, the Congress had to live by, could not amend, gave up its prerogatives to amend, could only vote up or down, and then we found the administration could void it for whatever reason. That means that system no longer is of sound integrity, so if it is ever visited again it will have to be in a form that includes the President--not just the people and the Congress. 
I assume the Senator from Oklahoma will agree with that.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is indeed unfortunate that such a critical piece of legislation for the authorization of the Department of Defense has been encumbered by a disagreement over the last Base Closure Commission findings. 
If I might, Mr. President, give a broad overview as one of the Senators who was deeply involved in the last round of the BRAC, Base Realignment and Closure Commission. BRAC was designed because it is so terribly difficult for the issues of base closures and shutdowns to be handled in this political environment. 
So a highly disciplined system was envisioned--a commission that would independently review these core and critical issues and would come back to the legislature, and the legislature would have to vote it up or down. No amendments could be made. 
In other words, the traditional legislative actions and prerogatives were removed. You could only be for it or against it. In this particular case, the Air Force had five bases throughout the country, and many experts thought there were too many and some had to be closed. Originally, the Air Force wanted to keep all five of them open as the process began. But BRAC did not agree with them. BRAC thought that would make five Air Force bases inefficient and, therefore, some had to be closed and the work moved to the remaining Air Force bases to produce an efficiency ratio. 
After extensive discussions by BRAC and their commission, they came to the legislature and recommended the closure of Kelly Air Force Base in Texas, which is tough. If you ever lived in a community where one of those closures occurred, it is tough. I understand and empathize with the Senators from California and Texas. That is tough medicine. But they called for the closure of Kelly in Texas and McClellan in California, leaving three Air Force logistics centers open--one in Georgia, one in Oklahoma, one in Utah. The work would be moved to the remaining three, making those three efficient operations. 
Mr. President, the administration and the President sullied BRAC, because they overrode the commission. In other words, the people had to live by it, Congress had to live by it, but the administration didn't. We were in an election year. Texas and California are very big and very important. So they instituted this concept of privatization. They theoretically closed Kelly and McClellan, as has been alluded to by the Senator, but they left everything else there under the guise of privatization. For example, the total number of employees at Kelly and McClellan before the Base Closure Commission called for their closing was 33,000 people. Today, the number of employees at these two installations is 31,000 employees. That is according to the General Accounting Office. The General Accounting Office has told us that this override has resulted in the failure to save $400 million to $600 million. 
The point that I want to make is that when the administration decided to intervene in the findings of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, they reintroduced the very activity that we are engaged in on the Senate floor today. They put it back into the political process. I can say this, Mr. President. There will never be another BRAC, as we knew it, because you can't have a discipline where the people had to stand up and fight for their installations, the people that work there. The Congress had none of its authority. All of its prerogatives were removed except to vote for or against it, and then the administration may unilaterally alter it. That voids the discipline. So that process will never occur again. It can't. If you are going to have something that highly disciplined, it has to apply to the people of our country, the citizens that are affected, to the members of the legislative body, and to the President of the United States. It can't just apply to two parts of the puzzle. With this exercise, you track it directly to the White House. When they decided to take the Base Realignment and Closure Commission and politicize it, that, if effect, eliminated BRAC as a discipline or policy that can ever be used by this Government again to deal with these contentious questions. If it ever comes again, it will have to be completely redone and redesigned so that it applies to the President and the administration as well as to the people in the Congress. 
I understand the Senator from Texas. Once that policy was breached, she has no choice but to defend the people of Texas and the workers in Texas. It is the same with the Senators from California. This was what BRAC was to have avoided--and it did, for all practical purposes, until the last round. 
Mr. President, it is unfortunate. It means that that system will never be used again, from my point of view, until the administration and Department of Defense can certify that the recommendations of the last round of BRAC have been carried out, that the three remaining logistic bases have been shifted to work that was purported to go there to make them efficient. There is just not going to be another Base Closure Commission. The Department of Defense is going to have to demonstrate that they got the job done from the last ones before they come back and ask for new ones, and the Department of Defense and the administration are going to have to rewrite the rules so that it applies to them as well as to the people in Congress. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the cold war fades into memory, our foreign affairs establishment must aggressively target and confront the new threats facing America. The crime and violence sown by international narcotics mafias requires a new thinking and focus. While diplomatic efforts for most of our Nation's history have focused on checking unfriendly governments, the challenge of narcotics trafficking and organized crime forces us to grapple with a more shadowy and elusive adversary. These cartels are not confined by borders and operate outside of the bright scrutiny of international affairs. They respect no nation's laws or ethics, outmaneuver government bureaucracies with a ruthless efficiency and have financial resources which dwarf many national budgets. In the face of this great menace, our State Department cannot hope to make progress without a forward looking strategy, clearly defined goals, and the ability to learn from experience and agilely adapt to match this constantly changing threat. 
Far too often our diplomatic structures have not adopted to address these new, transnational problems and remained locked in a bilateral mind set. The State Department's strong efforts in an individual country can be easily foiled as these elusive mafias shift operations across borders. In order to effect a new transnational mind set and give the threats of narcotics and international crime the focus they demand, direction must come from the highest levels of the State Department. The various bureaus and country teams under the State Department must operate under coordinated plan with specific goals which they are held responsible for achieving. Like the adversaries which it must confront, our diplomatic effort must learn from its mistakes and recalibrate its strategies to adjust to new situations. 
Mr. President, the Coverdell-Kerry amendment seeks to do just that. This amendment does not seek to dictate the policy of the State Department or expand its role in counterdrug matters. It merely requires that the State Department formulate its own plan of action in coordination with the dictate of the President's National Drug Control Strategy. If, as some have claimed, the State Department is already following a clear strategy, this amendment will ensure that its goals and objectives are clear to the Congress which is responsible for its oversight and funding. In any event, it is crucial that we defend America's children and our national interest in the most effective manner possible. As we work to regain ground in our international struggle against drug trafficking, it is our responsibility to ensure that our resources are focused on strategic objectives and are specifically targeted to have an impact in the war on drugs. 
This amendment also calls on the State Department to work with Federal law enforcement agencies to further shield Americans from international criminals. Currently the failure of our Federal agencies to coordinate has allowed terrorists and other violent criminals to slip into our Nation. The establishment of the new information sharing system called for in this amendment will help ensure that our State Department has the information necessary to keep violent international criminals off America's streets. 
The reforms called for in the Coverdell-Kerry amendment are just first steps in what must be a thorough rethinking of how our national policies should be adapted to protect Americans from these new threats. I look forward to working with Senator Kerry and others as we approach the difficult task of preparing our Nation to meet these important challenges.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that is critical to our Nation's charities, the Charitable Donation Antitrust Immunity Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to make minor modifications to a bill that was passed by Congress in 1995 with unprecedented bipartisan support. The House passed the bill on a rollcall vote of 427 to 0, and the Senate immediately passed the measure by unanimous consent. I am hopeful that we can move this bill as quickly. 
The Charitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act of 1995 was enacted in response to a lawsuit that threatened, and still threatens, the financial well being of thousands of charities. The 1995 act exempts charities from the antitrust laws which use the same annuity rate for the purpose of issuing charitable gift annuities. For more than 100 years, the issuance of gift annuities by thousands of charities across the country has played a major role in raising billions of dollars for our nation's charities. The 1995 act ensures that the billions of dollars donated to charities is spent serving their constituencies, not on defending lawsuits. 
The legislation I am introducing today amends the Charitable Gift Annuity Antitrust Relief Act of 1995 to address technical issues raised by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court recently ruled that charities are not protected by the act if lawyers or other for-profit entities administer or assist with the charities' gift annuities. This legislation clarifies the 1995 act by replacing the current antitrust exemption for charities issuing gift annuities with antitrust immunity for charitable gift annuities. Charities have spent more than $20 million defending themselves from a single lawsuit. This clarification is critical in order to protect our Nation's charities from spending millions of dollars more on litigation instead of charitable purposes. 
Mr. President, the antitrust laws are intended to protect investors, not to frustrate gifts to charities. Faced with a continuing expensive lawsuit against Americans charities, and the threat of many more lawsuits to follow, Congress must make this technical change in the 1995 law to fulfill its original intent. Without this legislation, charitable organizations will lose a much needed and useful tool for raising funds precisely at a time when we must encourage this type of gift giving. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support for Women's Small Business Programs Act of 1997. As a member of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I have focused on helping small businesses succeed in an increasingly competitive environment. Women-owned small businesses have made impressive strides in recent years. To me, this is no surprise. 
Women-owned businesses are an increasingly important part of our Nation's economy. In 1996, they accounted for an estimated $2.3 trillion in sales and employed one out of every four workers totaling 18.5 million employees. According to the National Foundation of Women Business Owners, the growth of women-owned business continues to outpace overall business growth nearly 2 to 1. In my home State of Georgia, there are 143,045 women-owned businesses both full time and part time. 
I believe it is important the Federal Government continue to support the development of these small businesses and assist them in overcoming the unique challenges facing them. Currently, the Office of Women Business Ownership administers women's demonstration sites where women-owned small businesses can find critical support. These demonstration women business development centers at these sites are required to be completely self-sufficient a short period of time. I hope we succeed in the coming Small Business Administration reauthorization legislation to make these centers permanent. 
My legislation is simple. It allows these women business development centers to enter into contracts with other Federal departments and agencies to provide specific assistance to small business concerns. It expands their pool of available resources they can use to nurture women-owned small business. 
I have been working with the Senate Small Business Committee on this matter, and it is my understanding this proposal will become part of this year s SBA Reauthorization bill. I look forward to working with the committee to ensure the Federal Government provides women's business centers this critical support.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure I come to the floor today to speak about a distinguished colleague and dear personal friend, Senator Strom Thurmond. I, like so many American citizens, have admired the senior Senator from South Carolina for his outstanding service to the United States in this chamber, and for the life he has lived through military service in World War II to his years of teaching, coaching, and practicing law in the Palmetto State. 
The accomplishments and achievements which have been a part of Senator Thurmond's life are truly outstanding. Accordingly, his reach across this country, particularly the Southeast, is remarkable. One can go to the Georgia/South Carolina border, traveling along Interstate 20 to Florence, SC, and be driving on the Strom Thurmond Highway. Or one can take a stroll through the U.S. Capitol and walk into the beautiful Strom Thurmond room, so designated in 1991. These are just two of the many facilities named for the distinguished Senator because of his courage and patriotism. He has set a fine example for all Americans--from the students he taught from 1923-28 in Edgefield, McCormick, and Ridge Spring, SC, to the pages, interns, and staffers to whom he has been so gracious, friendly, and helpful since his arrival in the Senate in 1954. 
Senator Thurmond has served diligently on the Armed Services, Judiciary, and Veterans' Affairs Committees. He has not only been a champion for his State, supporting such vital missions as those performed at the Savannah River site, but also a leader on security issues for our Nation as a whole. There is no question that his knowledge, understanding, and expertise in military affairs and foreign policy has strengthened our national security and helped to maintain the status of the United States as the world's preeminent military and economic power. 
As a soldier, the Senator's record was no less impressive. In World War II, Senator Thurmond volunteered for active service on the day we declared war and flew his glider behind enemy lines during the D-day invasion with the 82d Airborne Division. 
Following these heroics, he was awarded 18 decorations, including the Purple Heart, Bronze Star for Valor, and the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster. His military service continued as he was promoted to major general in the U.S. Army Reserve in 1959. This is where he continued to serve in distinguished fashion for the next 36 years. 
With the rest of his military and political career well documented and chronicled on the floor by my colleagues, I would just like to close now by saying thank you to Senator Thurmond, as a citizen of the United States of America and as a colleague in the Senate. I am honored that I can say I served with you and called you my friend. Moreover, I know that many Americans will join me in commemorating the enduring record you have set and legacy you will leave for future generations.

So the emergency relief and all of its provisions, the guarantee you talk about to keep the Government from shutting down, was voted for by the leadership, Republican, Democrat, by the majority of both sides of the aisle, and the President says the Congress is playing games with emergency relief? It seems a little incongruous to me.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I think she is absolutely on point. Getting the emergency relief where it needs to go, protecting its ability to do its work, is in the President's hands now because Congress--particularly here in the Senate, but the House as well--has sent a broadly based, broadly agreed-to document to the President. So, if it doesn't move on to the people who need it, 
the President will have to accept that responsibility.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for the next 15 minutes or so, since we are talking about vetoes, I would like to talk about the Family Friendly Workplace Act, S. 4. This is a piece of legislation that has been authored by the good Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, myself, and others. It is designed to make the workplace a friendlier place, a more flexible place. Lo and behold, in the middle of the debate, the President has announced to the country he would have to veto this bill, which is as puzzling as his veto of this emergency relief. He has said he would have to veto the act. We have had a filibuster underway on this Family Friendly Workplace Act. We have tried to break the filibuster twice and have failed to do so because of the supporters of the President on the other side of the aisle. 
If you want to know what the American public thinks about this kind of legislation, you just need to go talk to them. In a survey for Money magazine in May of this year, 64 percent of the public and 68 percent of women would prefer time off to overtime pay if they had the choice, which they do not. The Federal workers, since 1978, have had this choice, but not these hourly laborers. If they had the choice, they would prefer time off to overtime pay. That is what the Family Friendly Workplace Act is about. It is about giving employees and their employers the voluntary--underscore voluntary--option to design programs to meet this desire.

Mr. COVERDELL. It is sort of ironic that this Monday afternoon we are beset with Presidential vetoes or threats to veto. He has indicated that he will veto the Family Friendly Workplace Act if it includes flextime, which is what I think most of us feel is among the more important features, to allow working families to adjust their time. 
The Senator from Wyoming has talked about compromise, but I just want to reiterate and try to get your impression. Don't you find it unusual that the only thing we have been met with here is a filibuster, and that if you are really interested in creating a family workplace work environment, wouldn't you think we would be getting suggested new language or something that might compromise, instead of sort of a straight-arm and voting down attempts to end the filibuster?

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. As usual, he has contributed substantially to the discussion. 
Mr. President, in my opening remarks, I spoke of the percentage of working women who would prefer time off to overtime pay if they had a choice, which they don't. That is what we are trying to create here. 
I read this very interesting article from the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute, `Work and Family Integration.' It is very interesting. It says: 
Economic changes have direct consequences on work and family life. 
That says it all. I have been arguing for the better part of 2 years now that when we talk about American culture and what is happening in the American family, we tend to point fingers to who is causing the trouble, and Hollywood gets a pretty good dose of it. But I don't think Hollywood holds a candle to Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam has put so much economic pressure on the working families that it has dramatically changed the nature of the way these families function. 
It goes on to say: 
It is increasingly common for all adult family members to spend a greater number of hours at work in order to make up for declining median family incomes to fulfill personal career goals or to cater to growing workplace demands. 
Again, I would argue, that while the median family income has declined, the biggest culprit in absorbing those median income salaries is the Government. In fact, by our analysis in Georgia, an average family today forfeits 55 percent of their income after they pay direct taxes, almost 40 percent, cost of Government regulations, $7,000 per family, and their share of higher interest payments because of the national debt that has been put on their backs. 
That pressure needs relief in many ways. No. 1, which we are talking about here, we need to lower the economic pressure, we need to lower the taxes on those average families; No. 2, there should be no impediment in the workplace that blocks working families and the companies for whom they work from finding ways to suit and balance the needs of these work careers and the needs at home. 
This article says: 
Married women with children have entered the labor force in record numbers. They, therefore, have less time for caregiving in the home. 
They have less time. We have seen the SAT scores aren't as good, teenage violence is worse, teenage suicide has quadrupled, and you have to say to yourself, `Well, if there is not as much opportunity or attention to govern the home, you are going to have problems like this that will begin to emerge.' 
Many parents, both mothers and fathers, feel conflicted and torn between spending time with their families and meeting workplace demands. 
This is the point I was making a moment ago: A massive amount of pressure in both places and we are operating under a workplace that is governed by laws that are a half a century old, 
almost 60 years old. You think back 60 years to 1930, the 1930 workplace. First of all, it was mostly rural. Now it is only 2 percent that is rural. Just reflect for a minute on the kinds of massive change that have occurred between 1930 and 1997 and you can understand that the governance in the workplace probably, like everything else, requires some modernization. 
It says work and family life should not be in opposition but should enrich each other. Work and family life should not be in opposition but should enrich each other. That is what this legislation is trying to do. It is trying to allow the workplace to adjust to the different needs that the different workers have with regard to maintaining and governing their families. 
Here is a quote:  
It's like you are caught between a rock and a hard place because if you want to have a family, you want to have a couple of children, you can't do that unless you have lots of money to support them. Well, you can, but you'd have to be able to take care of them, at least provide the basics, and in order to do that you either have to have your husband gone all the time working so hard or working toward getting his degree or else both of you have to be working, but the more you're working, the less time you have with your kids, so it's like you can't win. 
That is from a young woman in her twenties in Salt Lake City. 
But the more you're working, the less time you have with your kids, so it's like you can't win. 
You know, we wonder why, even with the economy doing reasonably well, why you get so much anxiety coming out of the workplace. Well, that is it, right there, `But the more you're working, the less time you have with your kids, so it's like you can't win. 
So here comes S. 4 and it says you and your employer voluntarily can make decisions and create options about what happens in the workplace so that hopefully it can help make it possible for you both to be working and still win. I am absolutely baffled by the threat from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, `I would have to veto this if flextime is left in the legislation.' That sure does not square with anything we are seeing or reading. 
I was looking at the average hours per week parents devote to undivided child care--in other words, full blown. If the woman is employed, it is 6.6 hours per week. If she is unemployed, it is just under double, 12.9 hours a week, of undivided attention. It doubles. 
Now, you cannot unemploy these people to get this added time. That will not work, given what has been happening here in Washington for the last 30 years and given the economic pressure on them, but you can begin to modify the rules in the workplace so that there is an offset, an opportunity to adjust. 
Mr. President, we have just been joined by the senior Senator from New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee and a Senator most knowledgeable and concerned about a friendly workplace. 
I yield up to 10 minutes if that is sufficient, to the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. COVERDELL. I yield 2 additional minutes to the Senator. 
For those who want to keep the standard 40-hour workweek from the Depression, they can keep it that way. For those of us who are yearning to make the workplace more hospitable to our working people, for those of us who are concerned about family life and would like to have workers have a little more family time, we urge the labor unions to change sides on this. 
I saw a couple of my friends from the labor unions outside in the hall and my first remark to them when I walked out was, `Why are you against the working women?' Of course, we had a lot of fun after that. But actually that is the issue. 
This bill will help women more than anything else, to provide them with flexibility and no loss of pay. This flexibility can be used to make their lives better in the event they need family time off to take care of things other than work. 
I believe the other side of the aisle needs to listen to what the American worker wants: flexibility. Ninety-one percent of working mothers support flexible work schedules. 
Now, frankly, there are many other reasons we could discuss here on the floor. Until the public gets excited and worked up, and until women start writing the labor unions and asking them: What are you doing to us? Why don't you keep yourselves out of this issue? and, Why are you against this? things won't change. Until there is enough foment in society for more flexibility in the workplace, then reform will not occur.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for a really precise and very focused presentation on the nature of the volunteer provisions of this legislation and the safeguards that are built into the legislation to assure that it is indeed a voluntary opportunity for workers and their employers. 
Just a moment ago, before the Senator from New Mexico arrived, I read this quote from Radcliffe Public Policy Institute, where this woman in her twenties says, `But the more you are working, the less time you have with your kids, so it's like you can't win.' He makes a point that we are going to need a public furor out there because this is good, common sense. We are trying to make it so that this 20-year-old woman, whoever she is, can be in the workplace and can win, and can meet the needs and issues of her family. This article goes on to say that XYZ company--they don't name the company--is trying to figure out how to deal with this fact. You have this 30-year-old with two kids at home, who is not going to give you 16 hours a day, as they did when they were in their twenties. Yet, we still want to be globally competitive. I actually don't think we have a good answer. These people, the ones who have opted to have kids and work less, are getting hurt in their reviews. 
See, the current work rules just don't meet the current requirements, and you can't make it so that one shoe fits everybody. It just doesn't. There are different pressures on the working mothers and fathers. That is why I have been so complimentary of the Senator from Missouri for coming forward with the family friendly workplace.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. I hope that the family that he alluded to in the term of his career will find the relief we are so avidly pursuing here. 
I have been reading--the Senator wasn't present through all of it--from the Radcliffe Public Policy Institute, the great article that talks about the rigors and stress in the workplace. And it says, `Effects of Economic Changes on Families and Children.' It is a short article. I hope everybody gets a chance to read it. 
It says that because mothers assume more of the caretaking responsibilities for children, the elderly, and frail, the problems of integrating work and family responsibilities can disproportionately impact women, both professionally and personally, the very point that S. 4 is trying to correct, or at least help correct. 
It says a major consequence of changes in the economy is that dependents do not spend as much time with the family members who are responsible for their welfare. 
I mentioned earlier. You can see it in all the data about family and children: school scores, the violence, the drugs, and a host of related problems. 
Relationships among all family members suffer, and in some cases affect both family stability and workplace performance. The total time parents spend with their children has diminished by about one-third in the last 30 years. 
In the face of that, the rules that govern the workplace have stayed virtually static. Here we have a situation where children receive a third less attention. Of course, SAT scores have plummeted, teenage violence has soared, and the Congress has not stepped forward to modernize that workplace. 
I thank the Senator from Ohio. We have just been joined by the primary author and sponsor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. He has done a remarkable job in explaining the necessity of this to America. 
I am going to yield the remainder of my time, which is about 5 minutes, to the bill's primary sponsor, Senator Ashcroft of Missouri.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend, Senator Abraham, in introducing the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act. As a member of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I have focused on helping small businesses succeed in an increasingly competitive environment. 
Small businesses are vulnerable to abusive lawsuits. Take for example the case of Dixie Flag Manufacturing, a small business in Texas that manufactures American flags. The company was named in an injury lawsuit claiming it manufactured an unreasonably dangerous product--a flag--that failed to carry proper instructions or warning labels. Ironically, Dixie Flag Manufacturing did not even make the flag involved in the injury prompting the lawsuit. In fact, its only connection to the incident was that it happened to be in the business of manufacturing American flags. Nevertheless, this mall family-owned business was forced to settle out of court in order to avoid large legal fees. 
The cost of obtaining product liability insurance has skyrocketed over the last 20 years, and small businesses have been disproportionately affected. A recent Gallup survey found that the fear of lawsuits drove 20 percent of small businesses not to hire more employees, expand the business, introduce a new product, or improve an existing one. 
I recently authored the Volunteer Protection Act to shield volunteers from unreasonable and costly lawsuits, and it received overwhelming support in Congress because it takes real action to promote voluntarism. Frivolous and absurd lawsuits are having a chilling effect on the volunteer community. Consequently, the Volunteer Protection Act deserves the President's unqualified support. 
The Gallup study demonstrates that the threat of frivolous lawsuits is having a similar chilling effect on small business. Simply put, the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act, which has been modeled after the Volunteer Protection Act, would provide needed protections for small businesses from abusive and frivolous lawsuits. 
Let me take this opportunity to briefly describe how the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act would protect small businesses, specifically those with fewer than 25 full-time employees. 
First, it would require that clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence must be present before punitive damages could be awarded against a small business. Second, it would place sensible limits on punitive damages, which could potentially bankrupt a small business. Third, it would provide for proportionate liability for small business. 
It is important to note that this legislation would give States the flexibility to impose conditions and to make exceptions to the granting of liability protection. In addition, it would allow States to opt for cases where all parties are citizens of that State. 
Finally, it is important to note that the bill clearly states which actions would not entitle a small business to protection. Any misconduct constituting a crime of violence, an act of international terrorism, a hate crime, a sexual offense, or a civil rights violation or misconduct occurring while under the influence of alcohol or drugs would not be covered. 
Mr. President, this is Small Business Week. Accordingly, all citizens should take a moment during this year's Small Business Week to recognize our economy's dependence on small business and realize the importance of nurturing their development. For Georgia, as is the case for the whole Nation, small businesses are the jobs provider and the backbone of our economy. The Small Business Administration reports that nearly 98 percent of the firms in Georgia that provide employment are small businesses. Moreover, it is estimated there are an additional 213,000 self-employed entrepreneurs in my State. 
What better time to highlight the importance of providing small business much-needed relief from abusive lawsuits than during Small Business Week? I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the Small Businesses Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act and in protecting small businesses from abusive litigation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, the issue embraced by this amendment is simple but important. In too many schools across our Nation the focus for our children is not on education but survival. Just 2 days ago, as I read from the Washington papers, four teenagers were arrested and charged with gang raping a 14-year-old girl last month by luring her from a cafeteria at a public high school in Queens to an unused classroom to carry out the attack, the authorities said yesterday. This amendment would allow local school districts, agencies, the right to use a voucher system to allow a victim of a crime to escape this kind of environment.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have today taken an important step to encourage more people to step forward and serve their communities as volunteers by removing the fear of unwarranted lawsuits against volunteers. Our adoption of S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, will grant immunity from personal civil liability, under certain circumstances, to volunteers working for nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. 
This legislation has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in both bodies. I want to thank all of those members who supported this bill to help our volunteers all across America. In particular, I would like to recognize the leadership of Senator McConnell, who has been a strong advocate of reform in this area, and the other cosponsors of the bill: Senator Abraham, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Enzi, Senator Gramm, Senator Gregg, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, Senator Kyl, Senator Santorum, and Senator Sessions. All of them were extremely helpful during the original Senate debate and in many other ways as we moved this legislation forward. 
I thank also Senator Leahy for his cooperation and leadership in striking a compromise that both sides of the aisle, and indeed both Chambers, could support. 
From the other body, I thank Congressman John Porter of Illinois, who has been promoting the issue of volunteer protection since 1986 and truly laid the foundation for today's success. Henry Hyde, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was instrumental in holding hearings on volunteer protection legislation. I should also thank Congressman Bob Inglis for his leadership on this issue. And Speaker Gingrich lent his strong support to our effort. We worked in close coordination with our colleagues in the other body and I appreciate their cooperation and hard work to make this victory possible for volunteers. 
We now send the Volunteer Protection Act to the White House with the expectation that the President will enthusiastically sign it. This legislation bears directly on the mission of the Philadelphia Summit held last month at which President Clinton, and former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford joined with Gen. Colin Powell and other leaders to ask Americans to make a commitment to volunteerism. 
Congress has now said to would-be volunteers that you don't have to be afraid of being named in a frivolous lawsuit based on your volunteer service. If you make a simple, honest mistake, we are not going to put all your assets on the block in a lawsuit lottery. Don't be afraid to step forward, get involved, and take an active part in the affairs of your community. 
We hope the President will join with the overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress and sign the Volunteer Protection Act into law.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a sense of the Senate amendment to the concurrent budget resolution before us that sets our nation on the path to budgetary balance. This amendment addresses a practice that I believe is one of the most reprehensible burdens government can place on its taxpayers, retroactive taxation. 
My conviction for putting a stop to retroactive taxation dates back to just months after I began my service representing Georgia in the United States Senate and occurred as a result of one of the most egregious examples of retroactive taxation in our history. I am speaking of the retroactive tax rate increases enacted as part of the Administration's 1993 tax package whose passage in the Senate required the Vice President to cast the deciding vote. 
At the time, estimates of the price tag to taxpayers of these retroactive tax increases were over $10 billion! In other words, with more than two-thirds of the year having been gone, the federal government effectively told the American people, `All your planning was for naught, and we don't care.' 
To bring an end to this practice, I introduced legislation in the 103rd Congress, the 104th Congress, and now in the 105th Congress. This is not an issue which I intend to drop, and I'll tell my colleagues why. 
Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to share with you the story of Mrs. Joanne Dixon, a retired farmer from Girard, Georgia, who suffered personally from the 1993 retroactive tax increases. In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism, and Property Rights, she described herself and her family as a simple farming family that, like many of their neighbors, farmed their land, attended church, contributed to their community and paid their taxes. They were proud to be farmers and still believe it to be a good life. 
Tragically, in February of 1993, her husband suffered a life-threatening illness brought on by the rigors of running a farm, which they had done together for 38 years. In light of the circumstances, it soon became clear they would have to leave farming and auction off everything they had worked for all their lives. In her testimony Mrs. Dixon said, `I could never put our feelings into words to adequately express what we went through. I will never forget the day of the auction itself. Looking back, I don't know how we stood it, but we managed.' 
After living with a very painful decision, the Dixons dutifully paid their taxes. Imagine if you would, Mr. President, their surprise when they learned they owed still more in federal taxes 
because of the 1993 retroactive increases. 
Let me again refer to Mrs. Dixon's own words, `The amount of money itself was not a large amount, but we still had to pay the retroactive tax out of funds we had planned for retirement. However, for me that is not the issue. After what we had been through to know that the federal government can tax you simply because it chooses was a real shock. Furthermore, our situation also left us with no way to recover the money we had to pay in this additional retroactive tax. We were out of business. The retroactive tax was a shameful tax.' 
Mr. President, it was clear to Thomas Jefferson that the only way to preserve freedom was to protect its citizen from oppressive taxation. I believe he would agree that the retroactive imposition of massive taxes is the ultimate slap in the face of the American citizen. Even the Russian Constitution does not allow you to tax retroactively. 
American families, businesses, and communities must know what the rules of the road are and that those rules will not change. They have to be able to plan their lives, plan for their families, and plan their tax burdens in advance. 
We have before us an historic opportunity to bring the Federal budget into balance. This is a goal I have worked long and hard to achieve since coming to the Senate. In the march to a balanced Federal budget, I believe we need to do so in a way that is fair to American families and small businesses.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, recently the Senate has made strong statements promoting efforts to fight against teenage drug use. Programs to mobilize America's parents are desperately needed in these efforts as we struggle to deal with a rising epidemic of teenage drug use. 
Survey after survey has shown a shocking rise in teenage drug use. Since 1992, drug use among teens has more than doubled. We recently learned that for the first time since the 1980's over half of all graduating high school seniors will have been involved with illegal drugs and the use of heroine and marijuana by high schoolers has reached levels unprecedented in the 1990's. The number of 8th graders who have used marijuana in the past month has exploded since 1991, growing by over 350%, and heroine use in our high schools has doubled. The fact that 35.8% (or more than one out of every three high school seniors) used marijuana in the past year should be a wake up call to us all, as marijuana serves as a gateway to the use of cocaine, LSD, heroin and other highly addictive drugs. Overall, this is a complete reversal from the previous 12 years when teen drug use was cut in half between 1980 and 1992. A decade of progress has been destroyed. 
Yet in spite of these alarming statistics, research conducted by the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education [PRIDE] shows that 7 out of 10 American parents are not talking to their children about the dangers of drug use. These numbers are especially alarming in light of the fact that PRIDE's research indicates that mobilizing parents is one of our most effective ways of fighting this rising epidemic. For example, among students who said they never hear from their parents on the subject of drugs, 35.5% reported using illicit drugs in the last year. Yet this number falls to 26.6%--a relative decrease of 25% for students whose parent often discuss this issue with them. In response to the rise of teenage drug use in the 1980's, parents across the country became active in the anti-drug movement. Their efforts played a key role in reducing drug use by teenagers from the all-time high of 54 percent in 1979 to just 27 percent by 1992. 
Over the past several years, PRIDE has devoted a great deal of attention to the question of how we, as a nation, can again capture the level of parental involvement that helped drive down teen drug use in the previous two decades. PRIDE has proposed a grassroots plan focused on a renewed parent movement in the fight against illegal drug use. The goal of this initiative is to educate parents and involve them in programs that will prevent and reduce drug abuse by their children. This volunteer-based approach will allow parents to create a drug prevention program most suitable to their community. 
My experience with PRIDE has convinced me that grassroots efforts by America's parents are essential in order to reverse the skyrocketing rates of teenage drug use. I hope that the Senate will build on the amendment I have offered today and fully support programs such as PRIDE which enlist our parents in the war on drugs.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, my good colleague from Missouri, Senator John Ashcroft, recently introduced legislation that would provide increased opportunities for working parents to spend more time with their families without losing 1 cent in compensation. 
It is popularly called flextime. It is legislation that allows a worker an opportunity to trade time-and-a-half for just time. I think it is a very, very important piece of legislation and very timely, because there have been so many changes in the workplace. 
This bill would allow employees to choose to work additional hours, more than 40, in one workweek and use those extra hours to fill in for a shorter workweek later. Or an employee could choose to take time off in lieu of overtime pay at a rate of 1 1/2 hours for each hour of overtime. An employee could also choose to work 80 hours over a 2-week period in any combination. 
Here is the important point, Madam President, that all of these choices are voluntary. These flexible options can only be exercised if the employee and employer agree to the concept. None of these choices would result in lower pay, and, in the case of comptime off, those hours not used, up to 240 could be cashed in at overtime rate pay. 
The point here is no one is being shortchanged. The point is that everybody has new flexibility, in terms of managing their workweek. 
One might have thought that President Clinton would have embraced this initiative wholeheartedly, but, no, President Clinton has threatened to veto these options, to strike down the opportunity for these workers to have these voluntary flexible options. He claims that the legislation will force employees to take time off in lieu of overtime pay. In other words, the employee would be forced to not receive the overtime pay but to take the time off. 
Some in the media have repeated this claim and then wrongly insisted that overtime would start only after an employee had worked 80 hours in 2 weeks, instead of 40 hours in 1 week, which is the current law. 
There is one thing wrong about these claims that have been made by the President and by some in the media: They are not true. They are not just a little off base, but utterly false. The administration and these other opponents need to read the bill. I have taken particular notice that critics never actually quote from the bill. 
Madam President, here is what the bill actually says, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. The bill allows:  
Employers to offer compensatory time off, which employees may voluntarily elect to receive, and to establish biweekly work programs and flexible credit hour programs, in which employees may voluntarily participate. 
Is that too hard for our critics to figure out? Just in case, here is what the bill has to say to employers who have other ideas. Employers, 
. . . may not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten or coerce, or attempt to intimidate, threaten or coerce, any-- 
Any-- 
. . . employee for the purpose of interfering with the rights of such employee under this section to elect or not to elect to [participate in one of the programs offered in the bill]. 
Madam President, if they do coerce, threaten or intimidate their employees, they are subject to criminal and civil penalties. 
This is a bill that benefits working parents. The bill has been endorsed by Working Women and by Working Mothers magazines and, yes, the New York Times. It does not mandate anything. Some employees may like the new options, others may not. That is the whole point. Employees should be able to decide what is best for them. This legislation ought to be a slam dunk. 
So why, you might ask, is the legislation even necessary? Because current Federal law prohibits such voluntary arrangements for everybody, except for Federal employees who have enjoyed these choices since 1978. 
I am going to repeat that. If you are a Federal employee, the very options and flexibility that we are trying to make available for hourly wage workers are already enjoyed by Federal employees that surround this Capitol. But it isn't good enough for the hourly worker in the private sector. 
Who would support the status quo? Who wants to leave it the way it is? I have already alluded to the fact that the President has threatened to veto any legislation that would provide these opportunities and this flexibility. Labor leaders, the labor bosses oppose it. When you think about it, the kinds of issues that exist between an employee and employer boil down to just two categories: hours of employment and compensation, whether in the form of health care plans, time off, salary, or overtime. If employers and employees can work out these issues by themselves, I believe that these union leaders feel they will be out of business. 
President Clinton has, thus, obliged the unions by producing his own proposal, which naturally gives the Secretary of Labor the discretion to decide which workers would be extended the kinds of scheduling choices we support. This doesn't meet the laugh test. Perhaps someone should notify the administration the election is over. Ordinary hard-working 
Americans, not labor bosses and leaders, reelected President Clinton and returned a Republican majority to Congress. They expect us to work together providing choices that allow families more time together, and that is a very good place to start working together. 
Madam President, I was reading a piece in a recent magazine, and the article is entitled, `Work and Family Integration.' I will just quote a couple paragraphs: 
Economic changes have direct consequences on work and family life. It is increasingly common for all adult family members to spend a greater number of hours at work in order to make up for declining median family incomes . . . 
I might point out that that decline has a lot to do with increasing tax burdens on these families. 
It goes on to say: 
to fulfill personal career goals, or to cater to growing workplace demands. Married women with children have entered the labor force in record numbers; they therefore have less time for care-giving in the home. Many parents, both mothers and fathers, feel conflicted and torn between spending time with their families and meeting workplace demands. Work and family life should not be in opposition, but should enrich each other. 
That is exactly what this legislation attempts to do. It attempts to make the workplace adjustable so that families who have these new and added pressures can make changes voluntarily to suit the requirements and needs of their families. 
When I first arrived here, there was a great hue and cry that the Congress operated under a different set of laws than American families and businesses. The new majority changed that. The Congress now lives under the same laws as the rest of the land. It is time that the hourly wage workers in America received the same breaks as the Federal workers in their Capital City, and this is the legislation that ought not to be filibustered and ought to be passed and sent to the workplace as a new option and opportunity for American workers. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. COVERDELL. You absolutely don't, but I would make an even greater distinction. Your legislation, which I have been 
proud to coauthor, and I commend the work of the Senator from Missouri, as I did before the Senator arrived, leaves the decision about what families need and don't need to the families, the workers themselves. 
The alternatives proposed--and there are several. One is to turn the decision over to Secretary Shalala. I think that is a pretty big job to try to figure out what the millions of working families need and don't need. I think she might not be up to that. Or to try to construct Federal law that manages time off, which may or may not deal with the circumstances of a family, and, no, it would not be pay.

Again, the point I am making is the principal distinction, and it appears so often between our two sides, is that the legislation of the Senator from Missouri leaves the choice to the worker and his or her family, the choice about time-and-a-half or trading the time-and-a-half. 
Their view is that it has to be managed by the Government or by Secretary Shalala. I just don't think they can figure out what the requirements and needs are of each one of those workers all across the land from Missouri to Georgia to Nome, AK.

They have enjoyed the benefit, and no one that I know of has issued the first complaint about those flexible options that are enjoyed by Federal employees. 
I mentioned a moment ago that when we came here, the Congress functioned under a different set of laws than American businesses. Now we have the Congressional Accountability Act, and we have put Congress under the same confines. It is time to let the private hourly workers enjoy the same benefits as Federal employees.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on May 14, 1997, I along with my colleague, Senator Feinstein of California, received a communique from President Clinton that I would like to read at this point. It says: 
Dear Senator Coverdell: Thank you for your letter regarding counterdrug cooperation between the United States and Mexico. I want to take this opportunity to tell you about my visit to Mexico and the efforts my Administration is making to advance our counternarcotics strategy in a bipartisan spirit. 
President Zedillo and I had a full and frank discussion on ways we can achieve greater progress toward attacking the abuse and trafficking of illegal drugs. The Binational Drug Threat Assessment report that General McCaffrey and Attorney General Madrazo presented to us sets forth in plain terms a common view of all aspects of the drug phenomena striking at our societies. On that basis, President Zedillo and I agreed to form an Alliance Against Drugs, which commits our two governments to prepare a common counterdrug strategy this year to achieve 16 specific objectives. 
These objectives, which reflect your own thoughtful contributions, include reducing demand through anti-drug information campaigns directed at our youth, bringing the leaders of criminal organizations to justice through strengthened law enforcement cooperation, attacking corruption, improving extradition (for example, by negotiating a protocol to the extradition treaty to allow trials in both countries prior to completion of sentences in either country), fully implementing laws to combat money laundering and increasing interdiction and eradication. Achieving all these objectives in the short term is unrealistic, but I believe we can make progress and that President Zedillo's effort to restructure Mexico's anti-drug forces is an essential starting point. 
I want to keep the Congress informed of the progress we are making toward achieving the objectives set forth in my 1997 National Drug Control Strategy and the U.S.-Mexico Alliance Against Drugs. ONDCP Director McCaffrey will provide further details on these issues to Members of both Houses in the near future. My Administration will also provide the Congress by September 1, 1997, a report covering each of the issues contained in the Senate resolution passed in March as elaborated in your recent letter and discussions with my Administration. In addition, we will provide reports, as you have requested, commenting on prospects for multilateral hemispheric cooperation and on the feasibility of enhancing truck inspections at the border. 
I appreciate your continued efforts to work with my Administration to ensure that our children face a future free of drugs and the crime they breed. 
Sincerely, Bill Clinton.  
Mr. President, this letter is in direct response to the legislation offered by myself and Senator Feinstein in March of this year, passed overwhelmingly by the Senate but which had not yet become law because of differences between the House and the Senate. 
Because the President was going to be in Mexico and in Central America, that led to extensive discussions between myself and Senator Feinstein and the administration, culminating with a discussion between myself and the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, during the trip to Mexico wherein the administration agreed to provide this letter of assurances to myself and Senator Feinstein, and in spirit the Congress and the other Senators who worked so diligently to pass these legislative proposals. 
From my point of view--and the Senator will speak for herself--it is a new platform. It is an acknowledgement of the issues that the Senator and I were trying to bring before the Congress, the Nation and the people of Mexico. 
I personally accept it in the spirit of cooperation and eagerly await the information to be provided to us in September. From my point of view, it is the acceptance of the point that was being made during the debate that the status quo was unacceptable for either country and that we had to move to a new era of more candor and more realism about the ravaging drug war and the damage it has done to both our countries and to the hemispheric democracy. So, I appreciate the National Security Adviser's conversation. I believe he and the administration fulfilled the discussion, at least to the level that I had it. 
I appreciate, again, and want to acknowledge the work of the Senator from California on this issue. It has been very dedicated, very focused, and very meaningful. I have enjoyed working with her on this matter. I believe the drug war in our hemisphere could potentially destabilize the hemisphere. It is doing enormous damage to the youth of our country and is an issue that must receive far more attention than it has to date. I hope this communique is not the end, but the beginning of much more work to be done by the Members of the Senate and the Congress. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my colleague from California is prepared to talk on the subject, and I welcome her remarks.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

As previously announced, any votes ordered on the budget resolution will be set aside to occur not before 5 p.m. on Monday. It is the intention of the majority leader that the Senate complete work on that very important matter prior to the Memorial Day recess. 
On Tuesday, the Senate may resume consideration of H.R. 1122, the partial-birth abortion ban bill, with the intention of a vote on final passage occurring early next week. 
In addition, if the committee completes work on the budget resolution on Monday, the Senate will resume consideration of the budget resolution on Tuesday. As always, the majority leader will notify Members as soon as any time agreements are reached on these matters. 
In addition, the majority leader wants to stress that next week is the last week prior to the Memorial Day recess. Therefore, Senators can expect a very busy week, with votes into the evening to complete action on the budget resolution, the supplemental appropriations bill, and any other legislative or executive business cleared for floor action.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I make the following remarks. 
The people of America want flextime. Working women, mothers and fathers need the same flexible work schedules and comptime choices that Government workers, salaried workers, bosses and boardroom executives have enjoyed for decades. I am particularly struck that, since 1978, Government workers have enjoyed what this legislation would provide other workers in the private sector. 
I remember when I came here it was important that there be congressional accountability, that the Congress operate under the same laws as the businesses and people of the country. I think that is applicable here, too. If Government workers can enjoy these benefits, then private sector employees ought to as well. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act is a matter of fairness to the workers of America. It is a high priority of the Republican leadership, and we intend to continue to press this case both here in the Senate and before the American people. A number of people on the other side, including the White House, have said both publicly and privately they want to get a bill. An op-ed, or editorial, in today's Wall Street Journal by the executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council urges passage of the bill. That appeared Thursday, May 15, 1997: `Comptime's Time Has Come.'

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, now is the time to get serious about this, but it is your move. I urge the White House to get with the sponsor of S. 4, and let us find out where the common ground is. Senators Jeffords, DeWine, and Ashcroft are ready to work with you, Mr. President, as they always have been. It is your move. 
I hope Senators who voted against cloture, cutting off debate, will think about whose side they are on. Are you on the side of those who already have flextime but want to deny others the same rights? Or are you on the side of the working women and men who do not have these options? The only workers who are denied flextime today are hourly workers: the secretaries, sales clerks, mechanics, factory workers in our country. They are the folks who get up early, punch in the time clock, and work hard to make ends meet. It is time that we were on the side of the millions of working class people in America who are denied these choices. I repeat these choices that Federal workers already have. Single moms, two-paycheck families need flextime. Just ask them and they will tell you. Let us give working parents a helping hand in the vital job they are doing. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to draw the attention of my distinguished colleagues to a very special event which will take place in Atlanta this coming Sunday, May 18--the Fifth Annual Lauren's Run. 
Lauren's Run is a fantastic kids-only fun run which is held every year at Zoo Atlanta. The purpose of the event is to raise funds for the Lauren Zagoria Pediatric Cancer Research Fellowship at City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, CA. The fellowship assists in the fight against pediatric cancer in all its forms through advanced research and clinical treatments at City of Hope, an institution renowned for the compassionate care it brings to children suffering from life-threatening diseases. 
Mr. President, all of us in this body have undoubtedly devoted ourselves at one time or another to worthy causes and humanitarian endeavors. But in my opinion, Lauren's Run is a truly special cause, and this is so for two reasons. 
First, because it honors a very special and beautiful little girl named Lauren Zagoria who was diagnosed when she was only 21 months old with neuroblastoma, a rare and fatal form of pediatric cancer. Lauren's parents, Janis and Marvin Zagoria, watched as their precious daughter was transformed not only by the ravages of the disease, but also by the ordeal of radiation treatments, bone marrow biopsies, and surgery. As Janis and Marvin have written about Laura, `She never complained; she never quit; she never stopped loving or trusting those who cared for her. After 14 months of struggling, the disease was just too big for one little girl.' 
Lauren's Run was borne of that child's tragic and painful struggle. Determined to honor Lauren's life and to sustain her legacy, Janis and Marvin Zagoria began to lay the groundwork for the children's run just 2 months after her death in March 1992. The first Lauren's Run was held in 1993. 
I will have the honor of attending the Fifth Annual Lauren's Run on May 18, and I will be presenting an American Hero award to Janis and Marvin Zagoria on that occasion. They are truly two wonderful points of light--people who inspire others in their community to do what is right on behalf of those in need. 
Mr. President, the other reason that I believe Lauren's Run is a special cause is because little Lauren Zagoria could have been any child in America today. We owe it to Lauren and to all the children we know and love to do everything in our power to eradicate the scourge of pediatric cancer. At City of Hope, pioneering work is underway to increase the long-term survival rate of children suffering from such illnesses. There is hope indeed that one day we may overcome the tragedy of pediatric cancer--provided that we open our hearts and, yes, our pocketbooks to enable research to discover the cures which are surely within reach. 
Mr. President, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of Lauren Zagoria and the work of two great Americans, Janis and Marvin Zagoria. And I ask that this body recognize the special significance and importance of the Fifth Annual Lauren's Run on May 18 in Atlanta.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, we have been at this for the better part of the week. I am pleased that the two sides have decided to proceed to the actual legislation and to consider its merits straightforwardly. I was also pleased to be notified this morning that during the summit--and I had not realized this--that occurred, Governors Branstad of Iowa, Whitman of New Jersey, and Wilson of California, issued a public statement in support of the Volunteer Protection Act while in Philadelphia, and called on the President to sign it. I am deeply grateful to these Governors, who have longstanding careers in public service, for stepping forward and calling on the passage of the Volunteer Protection Act. 
Mr. President, I thought it would be useful, given the fact that we are now beginning the actual debate, to revisit the general parameters of the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, which is a bill to provide certain protections to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities in lawsuits based on the activities of volunteers. 
First, Mr. President, I will frame the problem. Prior to 1980, there was virtually no issue for us to consider here. Millions upon millions of Americans over the history of our country have continued to step forward, help their neighbors, help in disasters, help that is grandiose, like fighting off the waters in a flood to something as simple as crossing the street with a spare meal or a good wish for a neighbor. 
But something happened in 1980. Suddenly there were several very celebrated lawsuit cases that targeted the volunteer. It changed the whole nature of the environment for voluntarism in America. As we moved on through the 1980's we found a situation where, with increasing frequency, for a variety of reasons, it was the volunteer that was singled out by a plaintiff or a claimant. It could have been that the organization that the individual was contributing to did not have any resources, that the volunteer had accumulated some assets--a home, a checking account, whatever--and so the lawyers for the claimant went to the volunteer. 
What has resulted from this? Well, as best we can tell, and you really cannot get the exact data, there have not been a rash of findings against the volunteers. They have been able to defend themselves, by and large. Many of the cases have been thrown out. But there is a chilling pall that has been cast over voluntarism across the land. In other words, we have put a question mark in the mind of an American volunteer. `Well, I want to help this family, I want to travel to North Dakota and help in that flood, but could I be putting my home or my business, or whatever we have accumulated in our family, at risk for having made this decision?' The answer, unfortunately, is yes. So the result is that voluntarism over the last several years since 1989 has been dropping--54 percent to 51 percent to 48 percent, the last number we have seen. 
Second, we have had thousands of volunteers who served on boards of colleges and universities and charities and charitable organizations resign because they became fearful they would be the target of these lawsuits. So you not only have people with 
a question in their mind about coming forward, you actually have caused volunteers to step backward and resign. Some estimates are as many as 50,000 of these kinds of occurrences have taken place. 
Now comes the summit, the volunteer summit, in the Presiding Officer's home State, Pennsylvania, in the city of Philadelphia, where the President and three former Presidents and First Ladies for six administrations have come forward, 100 mayors, 30 Governors, and called on America to step forward, to relight the fire, to reinvigorate volunteer activity in America. I believe that is a very wholesome thing, a very inspirational thing. 
But if you study the remarks, Mr. President, this was more than a call for voluntarism. It is very interesting as you review it. This is fairly well targeted. Children are evoked over and over and were the centerpoint of this call to voluntarism. Furthermore, the call was for voluntarism to occur in difficult environments. We have heard language like the poisonous streets. We are talking about difficult, rough, abnormal environment that you are asking these volunteers to go to. So the specter of the problem is elevating. You are asking them to go into a more troubled center, a more volatile arena, where communication and differences and diversity are great and, therefore, the probability of accident or misstep is higher. 
I have been arguing all week that the Congress should respond in a very forceful way by passing the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 which will make it easier for a volunteer to respond, in the first place; and second, to a troubled place. The Volunteer Protection Act takes the volunteer and provides some shield against being a target of a lawsuit. 
I told the story earlier in the week of a charity that ran a gym and a youngster broke a leg by dropping weights. A volunteer, a woman, was the receptionist--not in the gym. She is out answering the phone. She became the legal target. She had virtually nothing to do with the incident other than having been on the premises on the phone. The Volunteer Protection Act would have protected that woman because she had no relation to the incident. If she had been engaged in willful misconduct, if she had been reckless, wanton, if she had been involved in a hate crime or a sex crime or a civil rights crime, this legislation would not protect her, nor should it, and no one wants it to. It deals with simple acts of omission--an accident--that would protect the volunteer. 
I want to point out, because in all the chaotic conditions that go on on Capitol Hill, I am not sure everybody has had a chance to read it and understand that no one is protected from willful misconduct or reckless behavior or drunk driving. Mr. President, even if the volunteer is protected, the organization itself, the institution, the nonprofit, is still liable. 
This is directed, principally for acts of omission, at the volunteer. There are some other protections in the bill for nonprofits that would help the charitable organization, but primarily this legislation would protect the volunteer from simple acts of omission or an accident of that kind. 
The second thing it would do, Mr. President, is that it would create proportional responsibility. There is a legal term for that, but I think it is easier to understand when we say proportional responsibility. The case I just cited is a great example. This woman had no responsibility, so she would not be eligible to be a target. What it does here is, it says that you can't go after an individual, a volunteer, who has minimal responsibility or only a small proportion, or none, and cause them to be the target for compensation for the entire event, that there has to be proportional responsibility. That, too, would protect the volunteer. 
Mr. President, we have concluded--those of us who have cosponsored the legislation--that the issue is one of national concern and scope. I go back to the summit. They were not there creating volunteers for Philadelphia; they were there calling on the whole Nation to step forward. Volunteer organizations, many of them, are national in scope. You don't have to spend much time thinking about it. They are organizations like the American Red Cross, the United Way, and Little League Baseball. The call for voluntarism is a national call, not a local community call. Many of the volunteers cross State jurisdictions in their activities. There is absolutely no way that many of these charitable organizations--600,000 of them--could in any way understand the myriad of laws that relate to this across the several States. Certainly, a volunteer would have no capacity to do this. 
So this law, the Volunteer Protection Act, sets a national standard of protection. But if a State chose to create more protections, that would be their right. Or if the State took an affirmative act to opt out from under this in those cases where all the parties involved are citizens of that State, they could do that as well. So we believe this is an appropriate balance with regard to the interaction between the States and the Federal Government. 
Mr. President, I have gone back to this summit time and time again in the discussion, but there is something I noted here this morning that I think is very interesting. There was an article about the summit, and it says:  
Perhaps no one put the challenge more simply or compellingly than former First Lady Nancy Reagan, known during her White House years for her antidrug slogan, `Just say no' . . . 
For which, I might add, many of us are greatly indebted. 
Speaking for herself and her husband, ailing former President Ronald Reagan, she implored, `From this day forward, when someone asks you to help a child, just say yes.' 
Just say yes. How right she is. My plea to the Senate and to the House and to the President is, just make it easier to say yes. Let's try to remove this question mark that is holding volunteers back. Let's try to not call on them to step forward and then leave a system in place that trips them if they do. Let's remove this cloud that causes high-profile public policymakers to not agree to serve on a board. I venture to say, Mr. President, that every Member of Congress has had the question mark I am talking about in their minds at one time or another when they had to make a decision about whether to respond to an organization seeking their support. 
Let's try to create an environment where volunteers don't resign from boards but are willing to serve on them. Let's try to create an environment where a volunteer immediately would rush to an accident scene and not put a question in their mind about whether they are putting their assets into a legal lottery. Let's do it in a way that is thoughtful--and I believe we have--and which does not protect somebody from ill doing, which I believe we have. The minority leader and I had a brief discussion with regard to this yesterday evening. I was enumerating the fact that this would not protect reckless conduct. We want to be conscious of a victim of an accident. But we have to do something here to free up America so that it can do what it has always done. 
Mr. President, just before I conclude here, I want to reiterate that I believe American voluntarism is as much a part of our culture and life and a treasure of American life as our national monuments, our parks, and this very Capitol itself, because it is unique. There are very few places in the world where voluntarism takes on the components and proportions that it has in America. I was reading this morning that, last year alone, the equivalent value of American voluntarism, which was about 4 1/2 hours a week, was around $200 billion-plus that had been given freely. But that is declining, and that trend should be reversed. We should nurture this American treasure and we should protect it, just as if it were one of the crown jewels of this Nation, like our Capitol. 
Mr. President, I wanted to begin the debate by at least framing the reason for the law, a brief description of the law, and a call for the Congress to come forward and reinforce what 
took place in the historic days of the summit in Philadelphia, PA. 
With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend both the Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Missouri for their statements. Senator Ashcroft is a cosponsor, as is Senator Craig, and they both have devoted extensive activity and time and energy to the promotion of this legislation. 
Mr. President, I am going to talk a little bit more about the bill and then move to a quorum call. It is my understanding there are several Senators who wish to speak as if they were in morning business. It would be appropriate with us. We have now had a full hour framing S. 543, but I want to just go back to the summit a minute and quote three prominent figures in American life. As First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton put it in her column last week in the Washington Times: 
Whether through tutoring children, picking up litter on a highway, or providing free legal counsel to a needy client, we all have a chance to help address problems in our communities and enjoy the satisfaction that comes from being good neighbors. What we may not realize is that in the process we are also strengthening our democracy. Democracy depends on citizenship and citizenship depends on people voluntarily contributing their time and performing services that their country needs. 
She is absolutely correct. I have always believed, Mr. President, the genesis of the American spirit is that we are a free people, and if you really want to know the roots of voluntarism, because it is uniquely American, it is because we have been free and we have unleashed spirits and thinking and activity which the world has never seen nor compared. What we are talking about here in this legislation is there has evolved in the last decade and a half a constriction, a choke, on that kind of freedom. We have chilled it. What we are seeing is the same kind of thing that happens anytime a government or practice becomes engaged in constriction of freedom and the natural activity of human beings. 
We have, unwittingly I believe, had evolve a situation where the volunteer has become a target, and they have become fearful of it, which is a step back from freedom. Fear is one of the first things that happens when people, for whatever reason, begin to lose their freedom. They become fearful and their behavior changes. The explosion of voluntarism in America was born in freedom, and the constriction of it is occurring because they do not feel as free to do it. They fear harm. They fear retribution. They fear consequences. They fear for their families. So they alter their activity, and the Nation and the neighbor suffer. This legislation is designed to remove the fear and come back to the genesis of freedom to make choices, freedom to help the person cross the street or the person suffering from the flood that was described yesterday. 
I do not believe our policymakers have really quite understood how serious this is. Everybody is busy with all their activities and their agenda, whether you are the President of the United States or you are running a store or you are the mayor of a local town. No one realized the field changed in the 1980's; the volunteer was not as free to step forward. It happened in the 1980's. 
So, this legislation is necessary to try to recreate the environment that has so enriched our Nation and our country. 
Mr. President, I will take a minute. I have mentioned several times I am the former Director of the U.S. Peace Corps, which is one of America's preeminent institutions of voluntarism. There have been about 150,000, since 1961, who have gone all over the world, and their voluntarism does not stop there. In fact, the original charter of the Peace Corps has a third mission: Go where you are asked to go, be of assistance to the people there--and bring the knowledge of the world back home. So we continue to ask these volunteers to serve when they return, and thousands of them do. Many of their activities are addressed at the very core of the summit call--children. 
As you might expect in an institution like that, there is a lot of discussion about voluntarism. There would be discussion, from time to time, about: Should they receive greater compensation? Would that create more volunteers? And you always came up with the same answer, that what we wanted was the volunteer who willingly stepped forward and wanted to do it and there was not another incentive. They were not doing it for a check. They were doing it to serve. Because, when you alter that chemistry, the whole interaction between the volunteer and the beneficiary changes, and you create a completely different kind of interaction. 
I mentioned the story yesterday of the fellow who was helping train in the Civil Air Patrol. He even had to spend his own money to do it. But as he got out of the car he turned to me and he said, `But the payback is when I look in their faces, when I see their pride and sense of accomplishment.' That is a volunteer. 
This issue of legal threat changes the chemistry of the volunteer. It changes the component of the interaction between the volunteer and beneficiary and alters their behavior, sometimes to the point of causing it to cease. This is a very important piece of legislation, and it is about America. It is not very complicated--12 pages. But it is right near and sitting up beside the heart and soul of who we are as a people. We need to get this done. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see we have been joined by the distinguished Senator from--Alaska.

Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his remarks and his interest and dedication to the effort. 
I respond to him that, indeed, the effort to try to mesh the concerns on both sides is eagerly being addressed right here at the moment, and there are some positive indications, and I am hopeful that between the Senator from Vermont and his staff and ours and others that are interested in the subject, that we can show some very positive, bipartisan effort here maybe in the next couple of hours or so. Again, I thank him for the effort to create the atmosphere that would allow us to perhaps bring resolution to this matter this afternoon yet. 
Mr. President, I also say I think it is fair to note that the issue has been before the Congress in one form or another since 1985. This is the first time that we have really had legislation--that is 12 years. So we are really not dealing with a subject matter for which there is unfamiliarity. We are really trying to hasten the coming together. 
There is a propensity in Washington and in the Congress to mull things a bit long. We have had a summit in Philadelphia where we have had the President and three former Presidents, 30 Governors and 100 mayors say, `Now is the time. Now is the time.' They have called on over 2 million Americans to step forward. 
We want them to be able to step forward and not get tripped up. This is exactly the time for us to be addressing this legislation. It has been studied, reviewed, and argued for 12 years. We are down to, as I have said many times, 12 pages. I am very hopeful that people of good faith and good will on both sides can mesh these 12 pages together and, hopefully, by the end of the day, at least in the Senate, we can say yes to the President's call and yes to Nancy Reagan, when she said, `I hope from now on when somebody asks for a helping hand, you just say yes.' This helps American volunteers do just what she requested: Just say yes. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are very hopeful, now that we have gotten to S. 543, an accord that deals with the views and concerns of both sides can be reached, but that is not the case as yet and I thought I would take just a moment on something I wanted to acknowledge during the course of the debate. 
I found it very interesting that one of the periodicals that came out following the summit in Philadelphia quoted President Clinton and President Bush. I want to share that with the Senate. President Clinton said: 
I am keenly aware of the need for strong, caring adults in a child's life. My mother taught me to see opportunities where others see only challenges. My grandfather took me with him, visiting with neighbors and teaching me about people. My grandmother read aloud to me every day so I would be able to read before going to kindergarten. I want children in every family and community to have the same chance I did. 
President Bush said: 
I said it as President and I'll say it again: Someplace in this country every problem that plagues us is being solved through volunteerism, whether it's drug addiction, street crime or teenage pregnancy. Some community, through volunteers, has solved the problem. 
Both of these Presidents have pointed, as most of the summit did, to the shortfall that is occurring among and for many of the youth of our Nation, which is again why I think it is so important that S. 543 garner passage here today, because it will free up so much energy to address this problem. 
The other point I want to reiterate is that when you read through the statements and the work of General Powell and the others at the summit, they are not only talking about voluntarism but they are talking about voluntarism that occurs in very troubled communities. They use the terms poisonous streets and difficult environments. They are talking about not the everyday idea of an American family. They are talking about people who are products of broken families and very serious difficulties. The issue that I have tried to underscore with regard to S. 543 is that because these areas are so troubled and so difficult, it more than accentuates the need for some protection, legal protection for our volunteers who are willing to go into this area, because they are going into an environment, they are going into a situation that is troubled, volatile, abnormal, prone to difficulties and accidents, and conditions that would elevate the threat of legal ramifications. 
So I think it is important that we are not talking out of the summit about some of the more traditional forms of voluntarism, many of which are not surrounded with risk, but this call for 2 million people to step forward in a difficult situation is all the more reason this Congress should take steps to make it easier for those volunteers to step forward. 
Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague from Alaska has come to the floor, and I am glad to yield the floor so that he might make his remarks. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, too often, it seems good deeds and public service go unrecognized while it is precisely the proprietors of these acts who hold our communities together. I would like to take a moment to recognize one of these proprietors who I call unsung heroes. On Saturday, March 1 of this year, a dear friend and colleague of mine, Owen Williams, and his son, Alfredo, were tragically killed by a drunk driver in my home State of Georgia. 
Owen was a true hero in my eyes--bright, devout, and committed to his wife Carolyn and eight children. A former Vietnam combat veteran, Owen was dedicated to his community, his country, and his God. 
When I issued a call to action for Georgians to help reduce the rising tide of teen drug use, Owen was one of the first to answer. He served in a volunteer capacity as chairman of the Bibb County Operation Drug Free Georgia Committee and was making great strides in his community with the program. 
This Saturday, at our second annual statewide drug summit, which is dedicated to the memory of Owen and Alfredo, I will present the First American Hero Award to Owen's family for the great contributions he made to those around him. It has been said that the mark of a great man is that his deeds touch the lives of others even after he is gone. I know this will be true of Owen. This is a tragic loss, particularly for me, but the work that Owen has done will continue to serve as an inspiration to us all.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me explain our disposition. While there is considerable more time in the unanimous consent, it is anticipated that there would be a delegating of time back so we might vote as closely to 2 o'clock as possible. So, I would like to proceed to explain this amendment so we might get this piece done. There are conditions that are affecting certain Members that would require, hopefully, we could vote as close to 2 o'clock as possible. 
Mr. President, I want to explain to our colleagues. First, I thank the ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy. It has been a long week for both of us. He and his staff and colleagues have worked diligently with this Senator and his staff and colleagues throughout the morning to arrive at the amendment that has just been forwarded to the desk under unanimous consent. 
This substitute adds a finding to clarify the Federal role in civil liability matters related to voluntarism. The substitute clarifies the State opt-out section, to ensure the provision does not supersede State requirements for enacting legislation and allows for States to include an effective date. The substitute clarifies the punitive damage protections only relate to cases that are based on the actions of the volunteer and do not supersede more restrictive Federal or State laws. 
The substitute would clarify that the specific exemptions in the bill for cases of violent crime, sex offenses, hate crimes, civil rights violations, and DUI, do not restrict the general exemption where the harm was willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct or conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed. 
The substitute clarifies that the joint and several liability limitations for noneconomic damages and the punitive damage limitations only apply to defendants who are volunteers. The substitute clarifies that the volunteer can receive reimbursement for reasonable expenses and still be considered a volunteer. 
I and the other authors on our side have concurred with these changes. We still believe the version we submitted, S. 543, was reasoned and balanced, but feel that this is a compromise that gets us to the target we were after--the shield for the volunteer. And in these actions, assuming we receive a favorable vote, we will have responded responsibly and rightfully to the call of the administration, President Clinton, and Presidents Bush, Ford, and Carter, to launch a new era in voluntarism in the United States. 
With that brief statement, I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me give the disposition of our situation on S. 543. We are trying to communicate to the principal authors so that they might have a chance to make closing comments with regard to the amendment that I have submitted, and we are still endeavoring to try to vote between 2 and 2:15. 
While we are waiting for those Senators to arrive, I will talk about what the passage of this bill will mean, an achievement that will be secured in the Senate. 
We will have effectively responded to a circumstance that has been developing since the mid-1980's when volunteers suddenly found themselves the targets of lawsuits in the act of volunteering. Prior to that time, very little of this type of legal allegation occurred. We have discovered that voluntarism has been chilled and threatened and pushed back and been less exuberant. Volunteers' behavior is even different when they do volunteer because of the threat of legal consequences. 
When we pass this legislation, S. 543, and hopefully ultimately pass it in the House and send it to the President and he signs it, we will have created a protective buffer, a shield for the well-meaning volunteer, the volunteer who experiences a simple accident or omission. We have heard some of the stories on the floor of the Senate. A coach who has a player who inadvertently slides into home head first instead of feet first will not have to spend long nights awake wondering whether, because he was or she was a volunteer, they will lose their home and assets and checking account, et cetera. The principle we will have accomplished is to protect a volunteer from being under assault for that kind of omission. 
The second thing we will have achieved is that the volunteer will no longer be looked at as the deep pocket. If they volunteer for an organization that does not have any resources, they may have a home, or something to that effect, and so the suit goes to the volunteer instead of the organization. But now the volunteer cannot be held liable for anything more than their proportional responsibility. So the story we talked about on the floor of the Senate yesterday and today of the woman who was nothing more than a receptionist out front answering a phone while an accident occurred in the gym will no longer be held liable for the fact that something went wrong somewhere else. 
So this is very meaningful, as I said a moment ago, a very significant congressional initiative that keeps the legacy of the summit alive and helps fuel the call for new volunteers. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, said earlier today that one of the concerns of the summit was that it would flame out, that after all the glitz and the visuality of seeing the celebrities and political leaders gathered together, what would keep it going? I think S. 543 will be one response from the Congress, one opportunity to keep the fuel under the idea of more and more Americans stepping forward in a very, very difficult time. 
Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will be able to conclude this vote, if at all possible, by at least 2:15.

Mr. COVERDELL. I will take just a few minutes of my time, then do the same as the Senator from Vermont and yield back time and proceed to the vote. 
I want to take a moment to thank Senator Leahy and his staff. It is interesting how life makes people's paths cross each other from time to time. He and I have done so now on various occasions over the last decade. As always, I have found him to be an admirable either adversary or cooperator, but always with well-intentioned and good purpose. I thank him for his attention to this matter and the assistance both here and on those occasions in the past. 
I also want to thank Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell has labored in this area for years and has made contributions to this legislation that are exceedingly significant. I am very grateful for his assistance on this matter, as well as Senators Ashcroft, Santorum, and others. 
I want to acknowledge the work of Kyle McSlarrow, Terri Delgadillo, and Dan McGirt on our side who have worked so hard to iron out the differences so we could produce this meaningful piece of legislation. 
The hour is 2:05. We said we would vote as near as possible 
to 2 o'clock. I yield back all time on our side.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this morning the Senate will begin consideration of S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act. As a reminder, the previously ordered cloture votes for today are vitiated, and the Senate is now able to begin consideration of this important legislation. It is my understanding that amendments are expected to be offered to this bill. Therefore, Senators can anticipate votes throughout today's session of the Senate. It is the majority leader's hope that the Senate will be able to complete action on the Volunteer Protection Act today. 
Also, there is the possibility that the Senate could consider items on the Executive Calendar. Therefore, additional votes could occur other than votes on the Volunteer Protection Act during today's session. In addition, the Appropriations Committee has completed action on the supplemental appropriations bill and it is the majority leader's expectation to begin consideration of that bill next week. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. COVERDELL. My point is this. When we have a disaster, we typically use whatever vehicle is moving to deal with it. For example, in the great 500-year flood that we experienced several years ago in Georgia as a result of Alberto--and I believe we all understand the sense of urgency that comes from any Member of the body who represents that kind of a condition--for the long-term relief, I, along with my colleague at the time, Senator Nunn, were addressing it on a series of appropriations bills. So this disaster is being addressed on this appropriation vehicle, but it is not a bill for the disaster. It is the process in which we are engaged that we are using to help the disaster. 
Now, this is my last question, and then I will let the Senator proceed with his remarks. The Senator very astutely made the point that the emergency brings out our emergency resources. In our case, FEMA was there immediately. A coordinated center was set up for relief, water was flown in, and the National Guard was dispatched throughout the southwestern quadrant of the State. What we were dealing with in appropriations was the long-term build-back, which takes a long time. 
I just find it ironic, the one thing that you have to have to protect the long-term build-back is that the system does not shut down. So, for me, the idea of putting a disaster protection in the supplemental that assures that the long-term relief will not come to a stop suddenly because of politics is a pretty good idea. Would the Senator agree with that?

Mr. President, about an hour ago, to facilitate remarks on the subject we have been hearing about for the last hour, I stepped aside from the explanation of what is really before the Senate, which is S. 543. I see the Senator from Illinois here. I do have some rather extended comments to make about S. 543. So I might ask what would be required by the Senator who has come to the Senate floor?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the brevity of my colleague from Illinois. I will make a couple of comments about his remarks, and then return to S. 543. 
First, as he properly stated regarding S. 543, I was pleased to hear that he felt good about the legislation, that it has gotten caught up in the debate about the supplemental budget and about the nomination of Alexis Herman. But I would point out to the Senator from Illinois that we have been on S. 543 since Monday and have been blocked from action on it. And the supplemental legislation--which deals with Bosnia, which deals with the disaster, which deals with the multitude of issues--is not out of committee. And there is no reason whatsoever for it to be used as some political obstacle to block legislation that would help American volunteers respond to the President's request to step forward. 
I point out that S. 543 has been on the floor since Monday afternoon, and that we have been blocked from going to the legislation by a filibuster. And they have evoked the fact something about the supplemental and whether we are in a debate over a continuing resolution or not. It is not even out of committee. So, obviously, it cannot be used as any leverage against S. 543. 
With regard to the President's nomination of Alexis Herman to be Secretary of Labor, and the fact that that matter has not been brought to the floor, I don't believe that issue--which I will talk about in a second--should be used to deal with this very targeted, narrow legislation in response to the summit in Philadelphia. 
What you have there is an individual who went through the committee process, and purportedly handled her business there very well, but as the future spokesperson for the administration on labor failed to mention that the administration was 
contemplating a massive change in labor law; and that they were contemplating doing it not by bringing legislation to the House and the Senate but by making the change occur by decree--an Executive order issued by the President--that would exclude about 80 percent of the American work force from eligibility on a labor contract. That didn't come up in the hearing. That is not an insignificant policy. It is even in the minds of many a constitutional confrontation. 
We don't govern by decree in America--nor edict. The President cannot write the law. He can veto it, but he cannot write it. That is a huge issue. And the majority said, `Wait a minute. We want to talk more about that.' And we are going to. It is likely to be extensive. That is what that nomination is entrapped about--the idea that the President would rewrite law that has been in place for 60 years, and bypass the Congress. 
That disagreement, purportedly, according to the other side, is the reason that we should take no further action on S. 543, a 12-page bill, double-spaced bill, whose simple goal is to protect American volunteers from being undue legal targets. 
Prior to 1980, this was not a problem in our country. You can count on two fingers the number of lawsuits that have been targeted at volunteers. But in the 1980's there were several celebrated cases. And, all a sudden, there was a rush. `Well, here is a new resource that we can sue.' Often the volunteer organization has very limited resources. But maybe one of the volunteers owns a home, or maybe it is worth a quarter of a million dollars. `We will go after that.' This legislation says no. You can't do that. It has to be proportionate. 
There was a case discussed yesterday where a volunteer was sitting at the reception desk at a gym. A child in the gym dropped a weight and broke his or her leg. The volunteer agency that organized this recreation didn't have anything. But guess what? The volunteer answering the phone did. Who did they sue? Right--the volunteer answering the phone who had nothing to do with anything other than being a good-spirited American. When that news gets around town, how many people are going to go answer the phone? Not many. 
That is what we are trying to protect here in this legislation--that the volunteer could only be held liable for that which she was responsible, which was zero. A 12-page bill, double-spaced with a very narrow focus to that, tries to help fulfill the call of Presidents Clinton, Bush, Carter, and Ford: America, step up, renew our volunteer spirit, renew what is so unique about it, and reinvigorate your desire to come forward. 
If they do not protect those families and their assets, their homes, their checking accounts, that is asking more than they are going to get. Volunteers are willing to step forward, but it is another thing to say step forward and place everything you have in place to manage your family, you put that in a legal lottery, which is why there have been 48,000 resignations in the last several years, which is why voluntarism has dropped from 54 percent to 48 percent and going down, which is why charitable organizations do not have as much in resources to spend on their work because they are spending it on insurance, and which is why there is this chilling cloud. As more and more Americans realize they are not just volunteering to help someone in need, they are placing all their own property at risk, as everyone learns that, their first priority is to protect their own family.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I guess only those who have just tuned in would be aware of the fact that we have been discussing an attempt since Monday afternoon, from Monday afternoon until Wednesday at 3 p.m., to allow the Senate to proceed to S. 543. The other side has decided to filibuster this legislation and has now twice blocked our attempts to end debate and move on to the bill. Although we are getting closer, we might say, well, maybe if there are five more votes like the one today, we will finally end the debate; the bill being a very narrow, specific proposal that tries to respond to the call of the President and three former Presidents to encourage voluntarism in America. 
To revisit for a moment what was going on in Philadelphia, it was Gen. Colin Powell who said that `the multiple crises confronting children in America have the potential to explode our society.' I am going to reread the quote of General Powell. 
`The multiple crises confronting children have the potential to explode our society,' as General Powell called on his fellow Americans to make an extraordinary personal commitment to serve as mentors to at-risk youth. 
Earlier today I pointed out that volunteers being called on today are often called on to participate in situations that are less than normal environments; that the potential for volatility and miscommunication and misunderstanding is very high.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I appreciate very much the remarks by the Senator from Missouri. As usual they are most eloquent and inspirational and on target. I appreciate very much his coming to the floor and sharing his views on S. 543, of which he is a principal cosponsor. 
Madam President, I return to the point I was making a moment ago about what the Nation was being implored to do by General Powell and the President. Most of these initial quotes are from General Powell. He points out that President Clinton appointed General Powell as general chairman of the President's Summit for America's Future and the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff pledged to ensure that `promises made during the celebrity-packed event are fulfilled long after the hoopla is over.' 
Madam President, the hoopla is over. It is time, frankly, for all of these officials to send a message here, I think, that we need to take this affirmative step. It is a perfect affirmative step for us to take, following the glorious visuals, and get down to the real grassroots practicals, which are the protection, as framed in S. 543, of volunteers, so that they are able to respond to the hoopla. Down in my part of the country, they say this is now where `the rubber hits the road.' It is no longer the glory of the balloons and television. We are talking about the real, practical efforts that have to take place on the ground to make it possible for volunteers to renew America's volunteer spirit. 
The President went on to say to General Powell: `This may be your most important mission and I thank you for reenlisting.' The few thousand delegates from across the Nation who were seated on the lawn outside the historic structure, rose to their feet in applause. 
It is obvious that the inspirational moment was infectious. How often have we witnessed a gathering like this, raising the expectations, lifting the heart, bringing a nation to its feet--an exhilarating moment, only to find 3 months later or 6 months later that the issue disappeared with the last hand clap, that all the expectations that were being sought were forgotten after everybody got back on the plane, got back home. We do not want that to be the legacy of this summit. Congress ought to step forward, not only on the proposal that I and others have offered here, which alleviates, and creates a shield, protects the volunteers, makes it possible for them to answer this call and to be a piece of this applause, to be an extension of this applause. 
There are many things we ought to do to expand voluntarism in America, and make it easier and more readily doable. But an absolute must, as a beginning, Madam President, is that we remove the chill and legal intimidation that has caused a dramatic drop in the number of Americans who will answer the call, that have left doubt in volunteers about what they do. Even if they answer the call, the way they respond to their activity is changed and altered by this legal chill that hangs over voluntarism in America. 
It goes on to say: 
By encouraging volunteering, the President is trying to promote positive change in American society at a time when the Congress and bipartisan emphasis on balancing the Federal budget make it politically difficult, if not impossible, to create new Government programs to address the country's pressing social problems. 
This is an appropriate response. This is exactly correct. America's financial predicament does not allow us to do some of the things we have done in the past, and America must call on its citizens to help fill the gaps. 
This is not a new experience for America. America was founded in times of austere circumstances for most Americans, and it was in that era that the concept of American voluntarism was born. So we are not creating a new phenomenon here; we are simply returning to our roots. 
Everybody remembers--we have either seen it or read about it--the volunteer coming to the aid of a family that was damaged by some accident or problem in the rural area of our country--the barn building, the coming together in any kind of need to help families, community members. As I said earlier, this is as much a part of America's treasure as its Capitol, as its monuments, as its parks. Voluntarism is a unique feature of American life, and it ought to be nurtured and protected, just as we do the other American treasures, like the way we care for this Capitol. This is the Capitol of the United States, the capital of the free world, and it is an expression of who we are as a people, and we care for it. We should be every bit as attentive to our concern about the treasure that voluntarism makes for America. 
There is no way to ever calculate the value of what American voluntarism has meant to our country in any given year. It is billions upon billions of dollars that are freely given and invested to help the country be a better place. But I think the connection that the President makes between the need for voluntarism and the financial predicament the country faces is correct. 
This is a difficult time. This is a time of shrinking resources. Our generation of Americans has to confront decisions that were made over the last three decades that have left our generation to deal with over $5 trillion worth of debt and to deal with promises that, unmanaged, will consume 100 percent of the U.S. Treasury within 8 years. 
Let me repeat that. Our basic entitlement programs already consume over 50 percent of the U.S. Treasury, which is a dramatic increase from when I arrived just 4 years ago. It is spiraling upward. So it is absolutely correct for the President to make a linkage between the financial condition of the country and the need to reach out and get Americans to do things on their own accord that the Government can no longer do--maybe one can argue never should have done in the first place. I am sure part of the reason voluntarism has been weakened is because there has been a message that has been reverberating around the country for about 25 years that the final resolution of all of our community ills ought to be the Government. I think we are learning that that is not, and has never been, the case. 
The final resolution of many of our ills rests with the people themselves. A key component of that is the American spirit and the American willingness to volunteer. 
The President goes on and says:  
The era of big Government may be over, but the era of big challenges for our country is not. 
I think every American would agree with that. 
`So we need an era of big citizenship,' the President said in Philadelphia. `We need an era of big citizenship.' 
I certainly agree with that, and I think every Member of Congress would agree with that. But while the Government may not be able to do some of the things it used to do, the Government certainly should not be an impediment to big citizenship. The Government ought not to be throttling attempts to make it easier to be a forthcoming citizen. 
Frankly, I don't think the Government should be engaged in a filibuster that prevents our moving legislation that would make it dramatically and clearly easier to be a part of the era of big citizenship. 
General Powell, who has experience orchestrating successful operations, has made it his own personal crusade to recruit an army of millions of volunteers around the country. He has committed himself to being able to certify by the year 2000 that the 2 million children lacking mentoring, safe places to play and learn, health care, marketable skills, and a good education will have those needs met. 
Once again, he alludes to the point that I have mentioned several times this afternoon. Safe places to play begs the question that many of them do not have safe places to play today. They are dangerous places, and being dangerous, they are more likely to be places in which accidents and mistakes and misunderstandings occur. In other words, this is not your normal playground. This may be a rough-edge community which you are asking the volunteer to enter, to subject themselves. 
A more dangerous place means it is fraught with the potential of legal action. So we are asking these millions of volunteers not only to come forward, but to come forward into environments that are less predictable and, therefore, create a greater risk for the volunteer. 
I mentioned earlier today, Madam President, that the need for this legislation is fairly new; that we did not have a problem of volunteers being sued until we got into the eighties. Suddenly they became targets, and once you get something like that started, it feeds on itself, and it has. So the lawsuits have grown, and the threat has grown. 
Now we are saying, in this environment where litigation is more prevalent, on top of that, we want you to go into a more difficult environment. Well, there is an incongruity here. As a result of this exchange, one of my first acts will be to communicate to General Powell that we need his help to convince this Congress that they need to remove barriers so that he can get his 2 million volunteers to come forward. 
Madam President, the hour is now 20 till 4. We have now been on this since 2 o'clock last Monday, this 12-page bill, double spaced, and we continue to be prohibited from actually going to the debate. We will revisit this, but for the moment, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I did not expect the majority leader to invest the time, which I very much appreciate his having done, to frame the nature of the situation we have here. But, just to restate it for those who may be listening, in response to the summit on voluntarism, we have brought to the Senate floor a very specific proposal, legislation, to make it easier for Americans to volunteer. We have moved to bring it before the Senate and the other side is filibustering that motion in order to prevent our taking action on this Volunteer Protection Act. 
As I said in response to the leader, this is legislation that has been before the Congress in one form or another for almost 12 years, and has been consistently rebutted by the hierarchy of the Trial Lawyers Association. It is 12 pages long and it gives modest protection to volunteers who step forward in the 600,000 organizations across our land who try to promote the interests of those in need, whether they are children, the elderly, the illiterate, the wounded, or those who have been affected by the very flood we are talking about in the Midwest. 
We have appeal after appeal from organization after organization requesting the legislation. They are having volunteer members of their boards of directors resign, because while they want to help, they do not envision taking all their family business and all their family assets and putting them in a lottery, so they resign. 
When the organization asks for a mother or father to step forward and coach Little League Baseball, they hesitate, because they have read about these illogical but, nevertheless, real lawsuits against volunteers. Often, the organization has no assets at all, but one of the volunteers does. And so the suit goes straight to the individual who has accumulated, for whatever reason, some resources, some wealth. They are at particular risk because they have what is called deep pockets. They are chilled from coming forward. Often these people are very talented, high capacity, but they are chilled away; they are cautioned away. 
I told the story several times on the floor of Terry Orr of the Washington Redskins. When he came to play for the ball club, senior team members brought him immediately in to help with the inner-city problems, with the children, which he did. Then he matured, and he took on the responsibility and went to the rookies. What did he hear? `Well, wait a minute.' First question, `What is the liability? How much at risk am I?' He found himself talking to attorneys, and he could not bring the same energy and resource that he had seen when he first came to the team. 
This is a rather new phenomenon. This has not been a part of American life until recently; in fact, until the 1980's. Lawsuits directed at volunteers, you could not count them on a hand, but in the eighties, several celebrated cases suddenly made the volunteer a new target. Throughout the eighties, we saw the number of Americans who were willing to volunteer shrink. We have seen the financial resources that have to be invested in protecting the volunteers grow, at the expense of the programs for which they were designed. For example, the Washington, DC, Girl Scouts have to sell 87,000 boxes of cookies to pay the premium for the protection of the volunteers--not to help the Girl Scouts, but to pay the premium to protect the volunteers. And we have seen volunteers leave the scene, resignation after resignation. 
This legislation, this very narrow and targeted piece of legislation, protects those volunteers, makes it easier for them to answer the call of the Presidents at the summit and will reduce the overall expenditure of the organizations trying to do good service and good work in our Nation. 
I might add that voluntarism, as I said yesterday, is uniquely American. It is a quality that has been noted by every nation about the American people. It really is near the heart and soul of who we are. It does not happen this way in most countries in the world. As the President knows, I was Director of the U.S. Peace Corps, and I had a chance to see it right up close. It is an American miracle, and it ought to be protected and cherished and nourished in every way that it can. I find it the irony of ironies that after that summit, we introduce this legislation and we are caught in a filibuster from the other side to keep this from being acted on. 
Mr. President, I see that I have been joined by my colleague from Wyoming, and I know that he has wanted to speak on this. I yield such time as he might need to speak on this proposal.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a very brief rebuttal to the argument we just heard from the Senator from New Mexico. He said the holding of this Cabinet nominee was unprecedented. I cannot speak to that one way or another. I have only been here 4 years, but I can say that the actions of his President, our President, are also unprecedented. An Executive order that totally rewrites labor law and obviates the Constitution is unprecedented and has no standing, in my judgment, in this debate--none. 
I think the Senator from Iowa said it eloquently. This is one we do for the volunteers.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just before the vote, the minority leader was speaking. Of course he addressed many matters not related to the legislation before us, but he did allude to it. I appreciate the kind remarks that he made and that perhaps there could be work done to arrive at an agreement which both sides--at least he could agree with. But he specifically alluded to the situation where you would not want to have a volunteer involved with a sexual harassment or sexual crime. 
I really do hope--this is not a long piece of legislation. It is 12 pages. I wish the staffs and Members would read it. I want to read this brief section, to respond to his comment: 
Exceptions to Limitations on Liability: The limitations on the liability of a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity under this section shall not apply [Note. No protection. There is no protection to the volunteer] to any misconduct that--

Mr. COVERDELL. I would say I would need maybe another 10 or 15 minutes on this matter before yielding to the other side. 
Let me also say, in deference, having experienced this sort of natural disaster in my own State, I can appreciate the deep concern of the Senator about it. It is my understanding that the supplemental is being marked up this afternoon. To have listened to the debate yesterday, you would have thought it was already out of committee, though. That is a proposal that is still in committee. This is a matter that is before the Senate. 
We have heard that voluntarism is healthier than ever, we have millions of volunteers, and we do not need a bill to encourage voluntarism. That is simply not the case, clearly not the case. According to the Independent Sector report, the percentage of Americans volunteering dropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1991 and 48 percent in 1993. So, from 1989, the number of Americans willing to volunteer has dropped 54, to 51, to 48. There may be any number of factors involved. I commend the President and ex-Presidents for trying to step forward and call on Americans to reverse the trend. 
If they want to reverse the trend, they are going to have to deal with this subject. They are going to have to make it not a threat to be a volunteer. They are going to have to create a condition that the volunteer, in addition to being asked to come forward and provide the public service, is not at the same time saying, `And I am going to take my family's home and bank account and put them on a Russian roulette lottery wheel to see if they are going to be at risk.' 
The Gallup organization studied voluntarism and found, in a study titled, `Liability Crisis and the Use of Volunteers of Nonprofit Associations,' that approximately 1 in 10 nonprofit organizations has experienced the resignation of a volunteer due to liability concerns. The only way we are going to turn that around is to pass S. 543, and to do it quickly. All the work of General Powell and the Presidents and the 30 Governors and 100 mayors in Philadelphia--that is a beautiful visual, and inspirational, but, unless we do something pragmatic like protecting these volunteers, you are not going to get the response that you are looking for. 
The Gallup organization also found that one in six volunteers reported withholding services due to a fear of exposure to liability suits. That is the point I made about, you step forward to volunteer but you are also putting at risk your home, your assets, your savings accounts. That is a little bit more to ask of a volunteer than I think they will find to be acceptable. 
One in seven nonprofit agencies have eliminated one or more of their valuable programs because of exposure to lawsuits. So, there are a number of conditions at play here. Not only do the organizations have to invest more of their dollars into insurance costs to try to protect the volunteers--and of course when it goes to insurance it is not buying swimming lessons, it is not feeding the hungry, it does not pay for medicine or assistance that goes to an elderly person. It goes to an insurance company to protect the volunteer, as best they can, from a lawyer in a lawsuit. 
So, it is diverting resources away from the purposes of the charity. It says, `We have heard that there is no evidence of a national crisis involving a flood of lawsuits and huge damage awards against volunteers of nonprofit organizations.' 
First, volunteers and organizations sued are not interested 
in publicizing the fact. They would just as soon it not be heard. So you really don't have a true sense of the magnitude of these lawsuits. Second, many cases are settled out of court. So there is no judgment entered. Again, insurance companies are not interested in publicizing or providing data on their settlements. 
Mr. President, I am told we have several Senators who are seeking time on various matters. I am going to ask unanimous consent, see if I can get this right, that we would next turn to Senator Dorgan for 10 minutes, go to Senator McCain for 10 minutes, Senator Conrad for 10 minutes and Senator Hutchison for 10 minutes.

Mr. COVERDELL. First of all, I thank the leader for focusing on this important measure this morning. I think you have pointed out what to me has been a startling irony, that the administration is calling on thousands of Americans to step forward and then sends a team down here to trip them if they do. 
The answer to the question is absolutely not. First of all, it is only 12 pages long and it is very precise. If you are involved with misconduct, reckless conduct, gross negligence, driving under the influence, a hate crime, a sex crime, a civil rights crime--this legislation offers you no protection. What it does is it deals with the volunteer who steps forward and makes a simple mistake or omission in the act of being that volunteer. It would grant protections, limited protections to a volunteer in that circumstance. 
It was suggested yesterday that organizations who promote hate would somehow find a shield in this measure. That was disappointing. I did not think that had a real place in the debate. Nevertheless, it was brought up and it is absolutely incorrect. No organization--they specifically alluded to the Ku Klux Klan--given the definition of an organization here, there is not a jury or a judge in America that would find that definition to include the Ku Klux Klan.

Mr. COVERDELL. Absolutely. It is not so much a case of the judgments. It is a case of the threat of the suit and what it can do to you. The best example is listed here where a man who is part of a rescue team rescued an individual who had fallen off a ledge and was paralyzed. The person who was rescued by that rescue team sued the rescuers for $12 million. 
It was ultimately thrown out of court. But it has had a chilling effect on people. You come forward, you want to volunteer, but you don't want to put your family's business or assets at risk for doing that.

Mr. COVERDELL. Let us look at the lineup here. I read a letter yesterday I have from Little League Baseball. You have the United Way, the Red Cross, the Navy League, the Air Force Association, the American Society of Association Executives. Who is on the other side here? What is the cast? It is those among the trial attorneys who simply cannot abide that there be any reform at all, including volunteers, from the protection of these kind of suits. That is never mentioned. But that is where the opposition is. 
We had a case from Senator Santorum who, in the last Congress, finally got the Emerson bill passed, which protected people who were giving food to homeless and starving people. It took the entire session and it was finally passed by unanimous consent in the waning hours of the last Congress--the same opponents. 
So here we are, trying to make it possible for Americans to respond to four Presidents: Clinton, Bush, Carter, and Ford; and here they are trying to block it.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just for clarification, we are debating, in essence, whether the other side will allow us to move to the Volunteer Protection Act. That is the beginning of something we describe in the Senate as a filibuster, an attempt to block consideration of the Volunteer Protection Act. 
I will take a moment just to describe the cast of characters here. What we have is a community that can perhaps be best described as Little League baseball that is trying to find relief from our current litigious society because they claim and can substantiate that it is having a chilling effect on the volunteer community. 
We have a number of legislators--myself, Senators McConnell, Ashcroft, Santorum, and others--who have tried to frame legislation under the Volunteer Protection Act that would protect the unique creature of a volunteer in America. We have some trial attorneys who are apparently objecting to even these limited reforms to protect volunteers and their participation in what makes America so good. 
The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 is a bill, first to describe it in general terms, to provide certain protections to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and Government entities from lawsuits based on activities of the volunteers. The findings are that potential volunteers are deterred from offering their services by the potential for liability actions against them; that many nonprofit organizations and Government entities that rely on volunteer service are harmed by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of directors and other service; and that this, therefore, diminishes the contribution of these programs in this most important time in our history, of volunteer activity on behalf of communities and, therefore, our nonprofit organizations have fewer programs and they are experiencing higher costs. 
The purpose of the Volunteer Protection Act is to promote the interests of social service programs beneficiaries and taxpayers by sustaining programs that rely on volunteers, by helping those entities, those organizations that encourage voluntarism in America. 
This would reform the laws to provide liability protection for volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and Government entities. It would put a limitation on the liability for volunteers. No volunteer of a nonprofit organization or governmental entity would be liable for harm caused by the act or omission of the volunteer. It has certain protections, of course. The volunteer must be acting within the scope of his or her responsibilities in the organization. If required, the volunteer must be properly licensed, certified, or authorized in the State where the harm might have occurred. There is no protection for volunteers if harm caused was willful or criminal misconduct, if it was gross negligence or reckless misconduct. 
The legislation does not affect any action brought by the organization itself against a volunteer, and it does not affect the liability of the organization itself for harm caused to any person. 
Mr. President, in the area of punitive damages--this is an area of the law that goes beyond just direct costs and deals with punishing someone--punitive damages are awarded to punish or deter misconduct by a defendant, 
as opposed to compensatory damages awarded to pay the plaintiff for harm that he or she has suffered. 
In this legislation, punitive damages may not be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or government entity for harm caused by a volunteer without clear and convincing evidence that the harm resulted from willful or criminal misconduct or gross negligence. 
No protection for volunteers or organizations for misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, a hate crime, a crime that involves a sexual offense or a civil rights violation, or where the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The legislation offers no defense or protection in these critical areas. 
The legislation deals with liability for noneconomic loss. Noneconomic losses are such things as physical and emotional pain or suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, or injury to reputation, et cetera. 
The legislation requires liability for noneconomic losses to be proportionately assigned and paid by each defendant. So it is therefore abolishing joint and several liability where any defendant can be required to pay the whole judgment even if the defendant were only minimally involved or at fault. 
The legislation, Mr. President, recognizes the State role in these affairs. It would preempt State law to the extent that State laws are inconsistent with the Volunteer Protection Act. But it does not preempt a State that provides greater protection for volunteers or any category of volunteers performing services for a nonprofit organization or governmental entity or for the organizations themselves.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to yield to my distinguished colleague from Missouri, but I want to make a couple of comments regarding the remarks of the Senator from Vermont. I have long worked with the Senator from Vermont on issues relating to voluntarism in the Peace Corps when I was director. But I have to say to him that evoking the Ku Klux Klan is something I would not have expected from him. It is demeaning. It is an inaccurate portrayal of the legislation. There is regional arrogance in the context of the Senator's statement, and I do not appreciate it.

Mr. COVERDELL. I am going to yield in a moment up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama, but I would just make two or three very quick points. 
No. 1, I believe the issues before us have been thoroughly debated over the last decade. This is not a piece of new legislation. No one in this body is surprised by any of the language in it. 
No. 2, this language preempts the assertion that the other side has made that it would have protections for an organization like the Ku Klux Klan. That is just not so, as has been stated by myself and the Senator from Missouri. 
No. 3, yes, it is an adjunct to the summit in Philadelphia. Here we had a bipartisan expression of Republican and Democrat Presidents calling on America to reinforce voluntarism, and it is an appropriate response. Yes, this is linked to that summit. It would be highly appropriate to respond aggressively to freeing up the American volunteer from a cloud hanging over his or her head. 
Mr. President, I now yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have said earlier today I do not think this is an appropriate response to the bipartisan appeal from Philadelphia, to be filibustering very narrow legislation to help volunteers respond to the call by four former Presidents and a former Chief of Staff. But there will be plenty of time to talk about that. I know that the senior Senator from Texas has 5 minutes on another matter. So I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed up to 5 minutes to cover that, and then we will return to the motion to proceed.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, just for clarification, before the Senate is a motion to proceed to S. 543. I would like to clarify for my colleagues, given the scope of the legislation, the importance of it, and timeliness of it, I am not eager to turn the aftermath of this cloture vote into a time that we substitute for morning business. I hope the remarks--and we, of course, sanctioned the previous remarks of the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Rhode Island--but I would be inclined to object to remarks for the next hour or so, not relating to the subject before the Senate. 
Mr. President, I might continue then, for a moment. The time for this debate ran out before our lunch recess. I was commenting on an article, a very balanced article that appeared in the ABA section of Business Law, with regard to what the Voluntary Protection Act is trying to accomplish. I had just read this point, that `As publicity about lawsuits and the insurance crunch raised volunteers' apprehension, their willingness to serve waned.' 
The point is, we have documented evidence that a growing number of citizens in our country who have traditionally engaged in something that is uniquely American, it truly is--and I might add that as a former Director of the U.S. Peace Corps I had a chance to witness this and listen to it and hear it reiterated around the world--that voluntarism, as we describe it in America, is unique and it is an invaluable treasure for American people. 
Here we have a situation that developed in the 1980's, where, suddenly, lawsuits directed at a volunteer, in search of more financial means or whatever, became highly publicized. So, obviously, it made a good Samaritan, somebody trying to step forward, someone trying to be a good American, nevertheless conscious of his or her prudent responsibility to protect their family, to protect the assets and the valuables that were there for the security of their family. As much as they wanted to volunteer, they had to suddenly be aware of, `Is this a threat to my own family?' 
I mentioned earlier this morning Terry Orr, who played for the Washington Redskins, was in the Capitol the other day and recounted the experience of joining the team and of senior players immediately taking him and putting him in the breach, so to speak, of voluntarism. It is something he wanted to do. Then, as his career grew and he matured in it, he turned to the rookies coming behind him and said: `Look, this is important work for the youth of the Capitol city.' And he was struck by the response. 
The response was, `What is my liability? Am I putting my family at risk here?' It was a whole new sequence or reaction to asking for volunteers. That is what this sentence means, `As publicity about the lawsuits and insurance crunch raised volunteers' apprehension, their willingness to serve waned.' 
This 12-page piece of legislation--this is not a 1,500-page bill. This is not overhaul of Medicare. It is 12 pages. Its effort is directed at putting some protective buffer around people who want to step forward and be volunteers and reduce the level of fear that they would have with regard to the welfare of their own family. 
It goes on to say, `Even though reports of actual judgments against volunteers remain scarce, the specter of a multimillion dollar claim casts a deep shadow.' So what is being said here is you do not have to have a lot of judgments. You do not have to 
have a litany of cases that go against volunteers. You only have to have the specter or possibility of the risk to be public, and suddenly the volunteers are very, very cautious about what they do and what they do not do. 
`Several surveys conducted during this period revealed that many organizations suffered board resignations'--which is what we alluded to earlier today--`and volunteer recruitment difficulties'--which I just talked about in the case of Washington Redskin player Terry Orr. `The lawyer on the board, a nonprofit's staff role, was often the first to resign.' I have experienced this myself. My guess is the President has experienced this issue. 
I told this story earlier today--over the weekend, I was down at Robins Air Force base and it was raining badly. So we were trying to get from the aircraft to the car. I misjudged where the corner of the car door was, which is what has caused this mark across my forehead. As I got on in the car, the Air Force Colonel say, `Gosh, I hope you are not going to sue the Air Force.' Which is just--it permeates our society, the question of fear of lawsuits. 
Faced with the prospect of charitable organizations closing their doors and potential volunteers staying home, legislators sought to offer protective warmth from the chill of potential liability. On the national level, U.S. Representative John Porter, Illinois, dramatized the problem. 
This is the point I want to make. This morning the other side talked about how suddenly this new idea was thrust on the Senate. It had not had the appropriate length of debate or hearings and that sort of thing. Like this is a new idea that has been around. Listen to this: 
`On the national level, U.S. Representative John Porter, Republican, Illinois, dramatized the problem in 1985'--Let's see, now, that is 12 years ago--`by assigning bill number 911 to his proposed Volunteer Protection Act.' Eleven years ago, and Lord knows how many thousands of volunteers who have not shown up in the 12 years, or how many hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent in an effort to try to respond to this that therefore did not go to help a child, an elderly person, a sick person, a person that has suffered from one of these floods that we have been talking about earlier today? Who knows how many people have not volunteered for that board or went out and coached Little League Baseball? Good grief, 1985, for a very narrowly defined effort to protect this unique quality in American government--or in American life, the volunteer. 
`His proposal,' Mr. Porter's, `was a Federal bill designed to spur State adoption of volunteer protection laws. As has been mentioned by the other side, in 1990, President Bush released a model act and called for State-by-State adoption. By then, though, each State legislator had already addressed the matter at least once and few were eager to tackle it again.' 
The other side tried to allude to a lapse on our side of our role in federalism. They were suggesting we had forgotten our interest in State management of issues. But, as Senator McConnell said when he came to the floor, this is a national issue. It has State ramifications, but it is a national issue. These hundreds of organizations, some of which I cited this morning that are supporting the Volunteer Protection Act, are national organizations and they are looking for national relief. They are interactive across State borders. They are dealing 
with organizations who represent multistate jurisdictions. Then it goes on to say, this article: `The blame falls largely on the patchwork nature of volunteer protection laws, which vary tremendously throughout the United States. To facilitate analysis and comparison, the nonprofit risk management center compiled them in a publication.' 
The article draws on that analysis. Mr. President, the Volunteer Protection Act does recognize the role of the States. And in those cases in which all the parties are of a single State, the State has the option and authority to opt out of this legislation if the case is at all related to citizens of the same State. 
It also allows the States laws that are more protective of the volunteers to stay, in effect, without change or preemption. But this article itself points very directly at the difficulties faced by the patchwork nature of volunteer protection laws as they exist today. 
Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor. I see the Senator from Indiana has arrived and would like to comment on the legislation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to make it clear that the proposal that is before the Senate is a motion to proceed to S. 543, which is the Volunteer Protection Act. I will work right off the comment of my colleague from Minnesota that we should not be playing politics or symbolism for something that is as central and fundamental as trying to respond to people in need. The very volunteers he talks about, this legislation applies to them. In fact, the Senator from Kentucky earlier today referred to the problems involved with his floods. As you know, my State suffered a 500-year-level flood from Hurricane Alberto, 200 miles long and 200 miles wide, as it marched throughout the State. I hearken to the point that the Senator made, that sometimes the worst of times produces the best in people. I don't think anyone has ever been through any of these that have not seen, with great admiration, the spontaneous response of neighbor to neighbor, American to American. 
The legislation before us ought to be managed, in my judgment, in about 2 to 4 hours. It is 12 pages long. Its concepts have been before the Senate for 12 years. Yet, we are in a filibuster over whether to even be able to debate legislation that, certifiably, is directed at the very people the Senator from Minnesota is talking about, and that is the thousands upon thousands of volunteers from his State and from other States. That is another key point. I know right now--I don't know the number--that there are thousands of volunteers in your State and others' that don't live there. They have come from other States, which is the very point that we have been making. The context of parameters around the protection of good people just trying to respond is a national issue.

Mr. COVERDELL. I think there has been great discussion in this 105th Congress, I say to my colleague from Minnesota, about a bipartisan effort. That does require a give and take. Right now, it would appear that in several quadrants that is difficult to achieve. I have served in the legislative body an extended period of time, and I think what the Senator points to is always the laudable goal and what all of its Members should reach for. I am sure the Senator from Minnesota will agree. I am not surprised that, from time to time, very powerful interests and emotions cause these kinds of strenuous areas. I commend the Senator for being attentive to the needs of his State. It is exactly what he should be doing. I have been there myself. I hope that as we move through the week, the resolution of the issue which he addresses can be accorded. I appreciate the interest in the legislation.

Mr. COVERDELL. I understand your caveat. 
Mr. President, we have been joined by the Senator from Pennsylvania, who, I might say, has been at the forefront of a concept called the `renewal alliance.' Even before this legislation was put together, the Senator from Pennsylvania and others--and I have been pleased to be a small part--have been engaged nationally, not just in Pennsylvania, in reaching out, just as this summit did in Philadelphia, and tapping the compassion of the American volunteer on all levels to confront some of the most difficult problems with which our country is beset. It is entirely appropriate, and I am very pleased that he would take time to come to the floor and talk about what the Volunteer Protection Act means and does for the very effort that he and these other Senators are pursuing. 
I yield the floor to the Senator from Pennsylvania.

Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will yield for a moment; earlier this morning there was discussion, almost because we are Republicans, about the national application of the act. And of course we have explained the national proportions of it, that volunteers are mobile. They are going into Minnesota and North Dakota right now. These organizations have national application. 
The Senator mentioned the Emerson Act. For a point of clarification, that legislation, which you struggled through and you were fighting the same kind of forces that we are here, had national application.

Mr. COVERDELL. The reason I asked the question was, first, to deal with the question brought up this morning about the importance of national policy with regard to--I mean, the summit was not about volunteers in Pennsylvania. The summit was about volunteers in America. This legislation is designed to protect volunteers in America. 
I will close with this and yield to the Senator from Missouri. Imagine, if you would, Senator, what will happen when Little League Baseball and United Way and the American Red Cross can stand up and say, `come on, volunteers. We have removed a major impediment for you to come forward.' 
Given your example, you can imagine. We will be freeing up America to get back to what it has always done so well, volunteering, and responding to that eloquent address you heard in Philadelphia from President Clinton.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from 
Michigan for his many contributions--not just the comments today, but the many contributions he has made on behalf of the act and on behalf of the outreach I spoke of earlier to involve citizens, and the renewal alliance, and all of the other work he has done. I appreciate him being here. 
Before he leaves, I want to thank him also for specifically referring to the suggestion, which I characterized as `very disappointing' this morning, that this legislation somehow gave undue protections to the Ku Klux Klan. I thought introducing that in an attempt to make some legitimate criticism of this legislation was inappropriate. I am appreciative that you would come with your legal background and point out, as I have tried to do--perhaps not as effectively as you have--how totally inaccurate that assertion was. I appreciate that. 
Mr. President, if I might take a moment, we are discussing a proposal to bring the Volunteer Protection Act before the Senate. We are trying to get to the point where we can consider the legislation, and there is a filibuster being conducted to prohibit it. 
It has been said all day long that it is of the utmost irony that the party of the President, who spoke so eloquently yesterday in Philadelphia on behalf of voluntarism, is consciously engaged in obstructing and preventing even the debate--we are not to the point of voting--about the Volunteer Protection Act, whose sole purpose is to make it more possible for volunteers to respond to the request of President Clinton, President Bush, President Carter, and President Ford for America to step forward. 
Mr. President, just to read from a press release, it says: 
Together with President Clinton, former Presidents, 30 Governors, 100 mayors, participated in a conference on volunteering. General Powell said, `As many as 15 million young Americans need mentoring to help them overcome the adversities they face. They are at risk of growing up unskilled, unlearned, or even worse, unloved.' General Powell said, standing outside Independence Hall, the birthplace of this Republic, `They are at risk of growing up physically or psychologically abused. They are at risk of growing up addicted to the pathologies and the poisons of the street. They are at risk of bringing children into the world before they themselves have grown up. They are at risk of never growing up at all.' 
Mr. President, we have heard from Little League Baseball, from the Red Cross, from boys clubs and girls clubs, from United Way, from former athletes who provide excellent role models for our young people. Just 2 weeks ago, Terry Orr of the Washington Redskins, standing before the world, said that he cannot get volunteers to do the very work that General Powell is alluding to here with inner-city kids, without first confronting a barrage of questions from the volunteer he is trying to recruit, the current rookies, without having to confront that rookie's attorney to determine how much risk is the volunteer going to face, how much threat is there to the assets of that volunteer's family. 
This legislation before the Senate, being filibustered before the Senate--and just another word on that. We have heard all day long about the holding up of the nomination of Alexis Herman. We have heard about the supplemental bill. We have heard about everything except allowing us to move forward with a 12-page bill that very simply makes it possible for a volunteer not to be free of willful or reckless activity or gross negligence but to be free of making just a mistake or omission in the act of being a volunteer--12 pages long. You would think we were rewriting the Constitution of the United States. 
It was suggested, well, this was brought up just because of the volunteer summit. Right. That is exactly why it is on the calendar today, so that there can be a congressional response to the call of the Nation's leaders, so that Americans can respond to the call of America's leaders. And I just find it unconscionable on two points, that we had an extended presentation which somehow would allege the authors of this legislation were protecting the Ku Klux Klan of all things. And I think a reading of any learned attorney would agree with the presentation by the Senator from Michigan that the legislation is carefully drafted. There would not be any protection to that kind of organization. And then that we would be confronted with a filibuster to keep us from trying to help fulfill the dreams and wishes of the summit and reinforce America's commitment to voluntarism.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, in light of the failed cloture vote that occurred today, on the motion to proceed to the Volunteer Protection Act, I have just filed two additional cloture motions which call for the cloture votes to occur on Thursday of this week. Senators should be aware that a second cloture vote on this issue will occur on Wednesday of this week. Assuming our Democratic colleagues choose to continue to filibuster the motion to proceed to the Volunteer Protection Act and the second cloture vote fails on Wednesday, April 30, then these two additional votes would be necessary on Thursday. As always, the leader will notify the body when these votes have been scheduled during Thursday's session of the Senate.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 5 minutes of my own time. 
Mr. President, of course, the matter before the Senate is the Volunteer Protection Act which we had hoped would be a response to an historic bipartisan summit on voluntarism. The Volunteer Protection Act is designed to stop a circumstance developing in our country where volunteers are frightened to participate in the 600,000 volunteer organizations for fear that by participating they will have put their family and their family's assets at risk. 
In the American Bar Association's section of business law recently a very balanced article occurs about the subject. It says: 
An analysis of the laws around the Nation uncovers two important facts. 
This is not exactly a partisan outfit. 
Many volunteers remain fully liable for any harm they cause and all volunteers remain liable for some actions. Prior to 1980, the number of significant lawsuits filed against volunteers might have been counted on one hand-- 
Prior to 1980, lawsuits directed at volunteers could be counted on one hand-- with fingers left over. But that all changed in the mid 1980's as several suits against volunteers attracted national media attention. Besides accounts of lawsuits against coaches, one of the most frequently publicized cases involved a California mountain rescue team which evacuated a climber who had injured his spine in a fall. The man later sued for $12 million alleging that rescuers' negligence had caused him to become paralyzed. With stories like this getting big play, volunteers were suddenly worrying about the possibility of personal liability.  
In other words, stepping forward, being a good Samaritan, and then having your family's assets all at risk. 
To meet the cost of higher insurance premiums, some nonprofit organizations cut back on services, that is, less attention to helping the elderly, the poor, and the children of our Nation. Others went without insurance, increasing the risk that an injured party would sue the organization's volunteers in search of a deep pocket. 
As publicity about the lawsuits and insurance crunch raised volunteers' apprehension, their willingness to serve waned. Even though reports of actual judgments against volunteers remain scarce, the specter of a multimillion-dollar claim cast a deep shadow--and this is the point. This is not a 300-page bill. This bill is 12 pages long, double spaced. This is not rocket science law. This does not require 15 years of hearings. This bill is very simple. It begins to protect the volunteer from simple mistakes or errors or omissions, not from gross negligence. It does not protect hate organizations. It is disappointing, to say the least, that an attempt to respond to four Presidents, two Republican and two Democrat, calling on America to step forward, and trying to aid and abet that by a very narrowly focused proposition that says when they do step forward, they are not stepping forward in front of a gun; they are free to step forward and volunteer without being unnaturally and unduly threatened from frivolous lawsuits or from an effort to seek a deep pocket.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today the Senate begins debate on the motion to proceed to S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. 
This bill would grant immunity from personal civil liability under certain circumstances to volunteers working for nonprofit organizations in governmental entities. This legislation is intended to encourage more people to step forward and serve their communities as volunteers by removing the fear of unwarranted lawsuits against volunteers. 
It is appropriate that we consider this issue today. Yesterday in Philadelphia a remarkable gathering got underway. The President's Summit for America's Future brought together President Clinton, President Bush, President Ford, President Carter, Gen. Colin Powell, and other national leaders in an effort to focus the Nation's attention on the importance of and the need for volunteer service. 
The assembled leaders there issued a call to action, asking every American to do more, asking all of us to volunteer our time and efforts in community service. 
This is in the best tradition of America. Since before our Nation's founding, charities have helped the poor, counseled the troubled, and by their example taught us to care for our neighbors. They are the key to our survival as a nation. Americans have a proud history of supporting volunteers. 
Yet, many who would heed the call of the Philadelphia summit will not do so--not because they lack the desire or the ability to help, but because they, quite frankly and rightly, fear risk of liability in a society that seems too often to resemble a lawsuit lottery. 
In a recent Gallup survey of nonprofit volunteers, one in six volunteers reported withholding their services for fear of being sued. About 1 in 10 nonprofit groups report the resignation of a volunteer over the threat of liability. Eighteen percent of those surveyed had withheld their leadership services due to fear of liability. 
These numbers reflect a chilling effect that causes potential volunteers to suppress their good intentions and their desire to get involved. Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on volunteers. Moreover, the very act of participating in charitable work helps bind Americans together as a people. At a time when there is so much good work that needs to be done, we cannot afford to have good people turn away for fear of a devastating lawsuit. 
That is why I introduced the Volunteer Protection Act, along with Senator McConnell, who has dedicated long service to this effort and who has been an outstanding leader on the issue, and Senator Abraham, Senator Santorum, and Senator Ashcroft. We have since been joined by a number of our colleagues. 
Briefly, Mr. President, our bill provides that no volunteer of a nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable for harm caused by a volunteer's negligent acts or omissions on behalf of the organization. To enjoy this protection, the volunteer must be acting within the scope of his or her responsibilities in the organization and must not cause harm by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct. 
It is also important to note that the protection from liability does not extend to misconduct involving violent crimes, hate crimes, sex crimes, or civil rights violations. It does not apply where the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This ensures that where volunteers truly exceed the bounds of appropriate conduct, they are liable. 
The bill is intended to protect volunteers who make simple, honest mistakes. Where behavior is more egregious, no protection is warranted. But in the many ridiculous cases where no such wrongdoing occurs, the volunteer will not face a lawsuit or financial ruin. We want to encourage people to get involved without the fear of losing their home and all the family assets in a lawsuit if an act happens. 
Persons injured by a volunteer's simple negligence will still be able to bring suit against the organization itself to compensate for their injuries. As a result, nonprofit organizations will continue to have the duty to properly screen, train, and supervise their volunteers. Nothing in this bill encourages carelessness on anyone's part. 
The bill requires clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence before punitive damages may be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity because of a volunteer's actions. Because punitive damages are intended to punish and deter misconduct, a higher standard is required to trigger those damages. Punitive damages will only be available where the defendant's conduct merits punishment. 
This bill also establishes a rule of proportionate liability rather than joint and several liability in suits based on the action of a volunteer. For noneconomic losses, the volunteer, the organization, and others who may be at fault in a given action will be responsible for paying only for their portion of the harm. Any defendant will continue to be jointly and severally liable for economic loss. 
We have seen a problem with joint and several liability in which one defendant is made to pay for all damages even though responsible for only a small portion. Such results are a severe burden on the United Way, the national organization sponsoring numerous local nonprofits. Although it cannot control local operations, the United Way often must defend itself in suits arising from injuries caused by the local entity. 
These holdings result from juries' desires to find someone with funds to pay for an innocent party's injury but the search for deep pockets produces what a Red Cross spokesperson calls `a chilling effect' on Red Cross relations with other nonprofits. The Red Cross is now less willing to cooperate with smaller more innovative local agencies that might make it more effective. 
So, on the issue of joint and several liability, the bill promotes a balance between ensuring full compensation for economic losses, including medical expenses, lost earnings, placement services, and out-of-pocket expenses, among others, and ensuring fairness in not holding volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and government entities responsible for noneconomic harm they do not cause. 
Mr. President, in putting this bill together, we were mindful of the concerns about federalism. While the bill will generally preempt State law to the extent that it is inconsistent with the bill, the bill will not preempt any State laws that provide additional protections from liability relating to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and government entities. This sets an outer limit of volunteer liability while permitting States to provide even greater protections. 
We give States flexibility to impose conditions and make exceptions to the granting of liability protection. And we allow States to affirmatively opt out of this law for those cases where both the plaintiff and the defendant are citizens of that State. 
Mr. President, the independent sector reports that the percentage of American volunteering dropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 48 percent in 1993. That, I might add, represents thousands upon thousands of volunteers. Obviously, there are a number of relevant factors explaining this decline. But one major reason is America's litigation explosion. 
Nonprofits must spend an increasing amount of time and resources preparing for, avoiding, and/or fighting lawsuits. Litigation renders them less effective at helping people, and it scares off the volunteers which they rely on. 
Mr. President, in closing, let me just once again remind my colleagues of the historic summit that occurred in Philadelphia yesterday. That summit was designed to remind Americans of something that is so very much unique to our Nation. The world has long studied and wondered and marveled at the American volunteer. 
I was fortunate to be the Director of the United States Peace Corps, which has sent about 150,000 volunteers into over 100 countries over the last 35-plus years. So I have had a chance to look right in the eye at this unique quality of the American spirit and can attest to it, and admire it. 
Your work is not finished when you leave the country that you have served. When you return to the United States the third goal begins--helping to make America understand the world. To do that we call on the volunteers to step forward again, again, and again. 
The United States should do everything within its power to nurture this unique treasure and to make it grow. It is infectious, and it is wonderfully healing. 
On my trip from the airport to the Senate Chamber, I was advised that this legislation has been caught in a leveraging dispute, and it is a dispute in which I participated--the Executive order proposed by the administration to very much narrow those eligible for Federal contract work. That dispute will go on for some time, but I cannot think of a worse piece of legislation to be dragged into the dispute. It should not be ensnarled. It should become another demonstration of what Republican and Democrat Presidents said to the Nation in Philadelphia yesterday. I hope the other side would think very carefully about drawing the Volunteer Protection Act, which is an extension of efforts to strengthen the American volunteer, into that dispute. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as many of us in the Congress and in the country began to realize last week, the President and the administration are endeavoring to change 60 years of labor law by edict or decree. I spoke on the floor and reminded the administration we do not govern by decree in America. We have three branches. A major and fundamental change in labor law must be legislated. The President can sign or veto it, but he cannot write law. That is not a function of the Presidency. 
I will probably visit some of these documents in a bit, but published reports show that labor leaders and the administration wrote the law that would essentially squeeze out all nonunion subcontractors and employees from doing work on Federal contracts. It is a lot more complicated than that, but that is the bottom line. So this law was written somewhere in the offices of these labor leaders. It is the fundamental construction of what the administration purports will be an Executive order, 
bypassing the legislative branch and writing law in a very narrow confine. 
You know, our forefathers were very careful in the construction of this Government to assure proper airing, thorough venting, debate on all sides. It is not easy to pass laws in America. It is not meant to be easy. The very thing for which this system was constructed was to prevent the very thing we are seeing from the administration. 
I would like to begin our discussion on this by sharing with the Senate several letters that I have received from folks back home with regard to this. 
Here is a letter dated March 13, 1997, from Large & Gilbert, certified public accountants. They are located in Macon, GA. It says: 
Dear President Clinton: I am writing this letter to express my outrage regarding comments made by Vice President Gore in a speech to the AFL-CIO in Los Angeles on February 18, 1997. Vice President Gore announced the Administration's plans to change the nation's federal procurement policy through an Executive Order that would encourage union-only project labor agreements. 
An Executive Order encouraging union-only PLAs would immediately implement an anti-competitive, protectionist, and discriminatory policy that goes against the basic principles of free market, open competition, and equal opportunity upon which the country was founded. 
Greater use of union-only PLAs will threaten job opportunities for the vast majority of America's workers. Union-only agreements discourage bidding by open shop, or merit shop, contractors and limit employment opportunities for workers who do not wish to be represented by a union. Union workers are less than 15 percent of America's work force. This kind of union-favoring tactic discriminates against the majority of American workers who choose not to join a union. 
PLAs add significantly to the cost of construction projects, because union labor costs are generally 10 to 20 percent higher than merit shop. Competitive bidding on public projects is in the best interest of all taxpayers because it ensures contracts are awarded based on who will do the best work at the best price, regardless of labor affiliation. 
And I might add that Georgia is one of about half the States that is a right-to-work State. 
At a time of strict budgetary constraints, PLAs are certainly a step in the wrong direction. 
Vice President Gore stated, `If you want to do business with the federal government, you'd better. . .respect civil, [no one would take offense with that] human [no one would be offended by that] and [here is the kicker] union rights.' 
In other words, if you want to do business with the Federal Government, the Vice President said, you better be in a union, you better point your direction toward a union or union membership or a union contract.  
Unions do not have the basic right to preferential treatment. 
That is what this gentlemen said. The union does not have the basic right to preferential treatment. They have equal access, but they do not have preferential access. 
Every American has the right to make a living and have equal access to federal work, regardless of organizational membership. 
How right he is. 
No one's tax dollars should be spent to support discriminatory federal policies [or Federal policies that select who among the bidders would have the most opportunity to get the work]. 
He goes on to say: 
Americans should at a minimum be guaranteed federal policies that support equal opportunity and free enterprises at the most basic level. Every American deserves the opportunity to compete, win and execute work based on merit--not because of race, gender, union affiliation, or any other discriminatory factor. It is not the role of the federal government to put our taxpayer dollars toward guaranteeing work for the unions or to help them increase their market share and membership. 
Vice President Gore's blanket statement promising a presidential veto of any legislation the unions find objectionable, without any consideration of improvements to workplace opportunities, is an outrage. Americans would be better served by an Administration that supports efforts to improve fair, flexible and equal workplace opportunities that will help make companies and workers more competitive. 
America has always been a leader for the rest of the world in the areas of a free market and equal opportunity, and this has always been a point of pride for our country. Please take the contents of this letter into account before making any Executive Order that would jeopardize the American peoples belief in our country, and the principles upon which it stands. 
That is Thomas K. Savage of Large & Gilbert, an accounting firm in Macon, GA. 
Some of these letters are very interesting and deserve a 
standing in the Record. 
This is a letter from W.S. Nielsen Co., Inc. Skylight Systems, Alpharetta, GA, writing to the President. He says: 
Dear Mr. President: Our small family owned business has grown over the last sixteen years to where it directly supports over 15 families. 
That is not a big company. It is awful big to the 15 families, I might point out, though. 
We have worked hard to train all our staff to be the best and safest in our field. Ours is a dangerous business. Our staff has earned an excellent reputation with our customers, many of whom work on federal and state construction projects. 
Your signing an executive order to use union-only project labor agreements is not fair to the families associated with our company. You are depriving them of work that their tax dollars are paying for and depriving fellow taxpayers of highly skilled craftsmen. 
Our employees believe that Americans should be guaranteed federal policy that support equal opportunity and free enterprise. They have earned the right to compete on a level field for any work they are qualified for. A union-only agreement has been earned in all the cheap ways to the detriment of all involved. 
All of us strongly urge you to cease your plans to issue the proposed executive order. 
Mr. President, we have been joined by the chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords of Vermont. I would like to yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator for comment on this matter.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for his comments and extensive work in this arena. I want to compliment him on the statement he made last week, a very thorough description and outline of this circumstance. I think the Senator has done the debate a great service. The letter of you and your colleagues on the Labor and Human Resources Committee that was sent to the President was a noteworthy contribution to the debate. 
I will read one more letter for the Record, Peachtree Interior Builders, another letter dated March 27, to the President:  
The purpose of this letter is to voice my opposition to your proposed Executive order to require Federal agencies to use union-only project labor agreements on Federal construction projects. This order would eliminate the possibility of thousands of contractors like myself from bidding on Federal projects. As a contractor and a taxpayer I would expect a level playing field on government contracts so everyone would have the opportunity to compete, win, and execute work based on merit. The 50 families that derive all or part of their livelihood from this company should be given the opportunity to compete on any government project, regardless of their union affiliation, race, gender, or any other discriminatory factor. 
Mr. President, I think it is somewhat useful to try to put this debate in context. I go back to Tuesday, February 18, of this year, when the Office of the Vice President issued a press release. It says: `For immediate release, Tuesday, February 18, 1997.' 
Vice President Gore Sends Message to Businesses. 
`Record of Labor Relations and Employment Practice Counts in Contracting. 
`In remarks to the AFL-CIO Executive Council, Vice President Gore today pledged that the Federal Government will change its rules'--now that is a key sentence--`will change its rules on Federal contracting to take into account businesses' record of labor relations on employment practices and policies.' 
So, the Vice President, speaking to the AFL-CIO Council says, `The Federal Government is going to change its rules.' What he did not say was the President is going to change the rules arbitrarily, by decree, by edict, by fiat, as the Senator from Vermont said. To change the labor rules, which have been a condition of law for the last 60 years, requires a legislative act and not a decree. 
He goes on to say, `How you treat your employees and how you treat unions counts with us. If you want to do business with the Federal Government you'd better maintain a safe workplace,'--everyone would agree with that--`respect civil, human'--everybody agrees with that,--`and union rights.' 
Well, that is not the law. You are not obligated to join a union in the United States. 
`The Vice President said the old rules,' what he means is the old law `allowed Federal contractors to get reimbursed for the costs of trying to persuade employees not to join unions and fighting unfair labor practices allegations. `But today we are going to start changing the rules because they're just plain wrong.' 
They may be, they may not be. But the way you change the law is in the legislative branch. You do not do it because of your own opinion. 
Shortly thereafter, on March 10, about 4 weeks later, lo and behold, John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, issues a press statement that says `Sweeney Blasts Avondale'--that is a shipbuilding company. 
In the four years since Avondale Shipyard workers won a union election, management has waged a . . . campaign of firings, discriminatory layoffs and legal challenges. 
In other words, they have been in a battle. 
Today, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney met with the workers at the New Orleans shipyard and calls on Avondale management to end its attack. He will remind Avondale, which receives Federal funds, that two weeks ago Vice President Gore said companies doing business with the government must respect . . . union rights. 
So the Vice President makes his statement. They have said they will change the rules. I am here to tell you, `You better pay attention to me' is what John Sweeney is saying. 
We have been joined by the senior Senator from Texas who wants to speak on this matter. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Texas.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, a news flash to President Clinton: In America, you do not get to rule by Presidential decree. 
President Clinton is prepared to provide the ultimate payoff to labor bosses, an Executive order that essentially mandates that Government contractors toe the union line. Too bad about the millions of American workers who choose not to belong to a union. Now they are to be second-class citizens. 
The policy substance of the President's gambit is sufficiently bad, but we suggest there is an even larger issue, one that goes to the very heart of our constitutional form of government. 
One of the great strengths of our Republic is a Constitution that reflects, and nicely balances, the tension between democratic representation in the legislative branch and the executive power of the President. The Founders established Congress in article I as the source of all legitimate authority, all legislative powers; that is, the authority granted by the people. The executive branch, at least in terms of domestic policy, is constrained by the requirement that the President take care that the laws be faithfully executed. 
Fairly elementary stuff. But in reality, of course, there has been a continuous struggle among the branches over where the legislative power begins and ends. Normally, these tensions erupt at times of great crisis: Lincoln during the Civil War, Truman and the steel mills. Typically they are bound up in questions of war and peace and the President's foreign policy role. 
What we face during the twilight of the Clinton era is something very different and much more worrisome. What we see now is a calculated strategy by the White House to ignore the unhappy reality that the President was reelected with less than a majority vote while the Republicans were reelected to a majority in Congress. Now, it appears his goal is to encourage gridlock in the Congress while issuing Executive orders and regulations that exceed his legal power to act. 
There is perhaps no area of Federal policy more contentious than labor issues. This has been true in fact for most of this century. It is also clear that labor bosses and leaders faced continued loss of power and declining membership. They have been stymied time and again in their efforts to expand their powers over unwilling American workers. 
So what has the President done here? He is issuing an Executive order that deprives nonunion employees of their right to choose whom they support in the political process. He attempted to bar, through an Executive order, any company that exercises its right to hire replacement workers during a strike, though the courts properly struck this down. He is now about to issue an Executive order that would allow agencies to bar--prohibit--Federal contractors if they do not use unionized labor. 
Most recently, he is playing with a change in procurement regulations that would bar companies from Federal contracts unless they had satisfactory labor relations. Determined by whom? The President. Unions could have a field day with that. All they would have to do is initiate a lawsuit under the National Labor Relations Act and, presto, you have a company that has unsatisfactory labor relations. This would be laughable if the impact were not so grave. Hundreds of billions 
of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake. 
In short, President Clinton's actions twist beyond recognition the role of the Presidency in the legislative process. The Framers were careful to ensure that the President's voice was a negative one by granting him the veto. They did not grant him the equal and opposite power--he did not get the power of decree. A negative power like a veto is more easily used to avert harm. The decree smacks of autocracy. 
But give the White House their due. The White House has carefully established precedents based on issues that are difficult to confront. Ironically, some of the most contentious issues are going to be the most difficult for the Congress to resolve. In some cases, perhaps a majority of Congress would agree, in others they will not. But we believe those are precisely the types of issues that are intended for legislative consideration and a majority vote. This is known as representative democracy. It might be messy. It might take longer than the pundits like. The results may not please everybody. But it is a process that is founded on the consent of our citizenry. 
This is a time when there are many questions on whether various individuals in the White House have been engaged in unlawful activity. Only time will tell how that plays out. What we do know right now is that even more than all these financial and campaign issues, the President's abuse of Executive orders and regulations is a direct threat to the rule of law in America. 
Mr. President, I now yield to my good colleague from New Hampshire 5 minutes of my time.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas not only for his statement and understanding of the issue but for taking the initiative affirmatively to correct it. I only wish it had not been the case that the legislative branch has engaged in legislation to protect its constitutional rights. 
If I might, I will take just a moment to describe by precedent the sequence of events that are occurring here. In the 1992 campaign for President, President Clinton took a position on striker replacement which had been in labor law since the mid-1930's, which, under certain circumstances, would allow a company meeting certain criteria to replace strikers who were striking not over economic matters. This has been a contentious issue. The President said he would support legislation that would prohibit that, even though it has been in labor law for over three decades. 
He was thwarted in that. Even though he controlled the Congress--he controlled the White House and he had a majority in the Senate and the House--and he could not secure consensus on that pledge that he had made. So the beginning of this new concept began to unfold, even in the early days of this administration. The President issued an Executive order on striker replacement because, as I said, he had promised this in his campaign, could not get the Congress to agree. 
After wooing labor during the election with promises of a ban, President Clinton made good on his pledge on March 8, 1995, when he issued Executive Order 12954, 
titled, `Ensuring the Economical and Efficient Administration and Completion of Federal Government Contracts.' The order authorized the Secretary of Labor to debar a contractor after finding that the contractor has permanently replaced lawfully striking employees, thus, making the contractor ineligible to receive Government contracts. 
As I said, Congress had rejected this legislatively. So the President ignored the will of the people, ignored the Congress, and imposed it through an Executive order. Now, what happened? Well, back to the ingeniousness of the forefathers. There is an executive, legislative, and judicial branch. Quite properly--I repeat, properly--a Federal appeals court unanimously declared that the Executive order exceeded the President's authority. He had overreached. He was governing by decree. This is not a part of the American republic. 
Now, here we come again, another Presidential campaign is carried out, commitments are made, but the President is finding a people's branch, the legislative branch, that will not accept an egregious command that excludes 80 percent of the work force. So according to the Bureau of National Affairs publication, it says, `The proposed Executive order would encourage Federal agencies to consider requiring the use of a project labor agreement for federally funded construction projects.' This is interesting language in the draft: `The Executive order was jointly developed by the Building and Construction Trades Department, the AFL-CIO, and the Clinton administration,' according to Robert A. Geogine, BCTD President, the President of that union. 
Here we have this new Senate Chamber, opened in 1859, and the House on the other side, the House and the Senate and the legislative process; but one trade union drew this law that would be imposed on all the American people and that would exclude 80 percent of the work force from having an opportunity to engage in these contracts. 
Mr. President, to add to this sequence of events, making it a little clearer--this is a new form of making laws in the American Republic, far from these hallowed Halls. This is a memo to the national and international union presidents from John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. It says: `Support for a proworker Federal procurement reform * * *' dated March 25, 1997. What it doesn't say is it's support for 20 percent of the workers, in a very select category, and to the exclusion of the others. And it says: `As you may recall, the Clinton administration recently announced its intention to undertake several initiatives that will,' in his words, `protect workers' rights and workplace standards * * *'--he is talking about the workers that belong to his union, not the rest of the workers--`* * * while improving Federal Government procurement and contracting practices * * *'--which means that the practices are designed to benefit his interest but not the other 80 percent. It says: `If properly implemented, these initiatives will affect the expenditure of * * *'--his words--`hundreds of billions of dollars every year.' In any given year, Federal contracts total as much as $200 billion, and Federal contractors and subcontractors employ approximately one-fifth of the labor force. 
He goes on in the memorandum to say, `The Government will be issuing proposed regulations that will accomplish three reforms. First, the Government will evaluate whether a bidder for a Government contract has a satisfactory record of labor relations.' 
Well, who makes that decision? I guess it would be made in the same room in which these procurement regulations were written, and that they would become the arbitrators of what is a satisfactory performance, just like they are the authors of this law that is being placed on the people of America, without any lawmaker ever voting on it. 
He goes on to say: `Second, the Government will not reimburse Federal contractors for the costs they incur in unsuccessfully defending against an unfair labor practice suit.' 
This has been an argument in the Labor Relations Board for over 30 years, as I said. 
`Third, the Government will not reimburse contractors for the money they spent to fight unionization.' Perhaps, but this is where we make these decisions, not wherever this room was. This goes on to say--and this is a very pertinent paragraph in this memo of March 25: `President Clinton will also issue an Executive order directing all Federal departments to consider using a project labor agreement when they undertake Government-funded construction projects. This order is not subject to notice and comment, or other administrative steps.' I repeat, `This order is not subject to notice and comment, or other administrative steps.' In other words, fiat, decree, governance by decree. And then it goes on and meticulously points out how the recipients of this memorandum should begin building cases. Lawyers should provide citations to the National Labor Relations Board and copies of all decisions, settlement agreements, et cetera. Organizers should provide information about campaigns and work sites. And lobbyists should review their files where local unions and other internal 
bodies have requested intervention, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 
Decree--written in some room between the Building Construction Trade Department, the AFL-CIO, and the President. It is a new way of writing law, Mr. President.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to first make it clear--and I think Senator Craig alluded to this--that this is a constitutional confrontation. There is a growing propensity on the part of the administration, faced with a Congress that the people elected that are of a majority of the other party, to try to obviate the legislative branch through two courses: By Executive order or decree--and we have certainly seen the abuses of that throughout the world, which is why the Republic is so carefully constructed; and by regulation, which is something that has become unique in our own development in this country, where more and more regulators are lawmakers. You can't blame this administration alone for that kind of activity, but it has certainly accelerated. 
I want to point out that I have already pointed out that the U.S. appellate court struck down the President's last attempt at this kind of reconstruction of the Republic. But there are other judicial precedents. 
Mr. President, I am going to yield the remainder of my time in just a moment. I see my good friend from Alabama. They are dealing with the logistics of time here in terms of trying to deal with the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I will close by simply saying there is a growing outrage in the Congress with regard to these attempts to reconstruct lawmaking. Lawmaking in America cannot be done in an isolated room with just special interests. Obviously, all interests have a rising ability to contribute their thoughts so long as they are debated and aired ultimately in the people's body and not bypassed. This is a clear attempt to bypass the legislature, and I do not believe it will be successful. Perhaps the administration needs to take counsel with itself with regard to the suggestions they have put forward--that major labor law would be written somewhere other than the Congress of the United States. 
Mr. President, I yield back all remaining time to the Senator from Alabama.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, let me thank all the Senators who have played a significant role in this legislation that we are about to vote on, certainly Senators Glenn of Ohio and Roth of Delaware and others, who have committed themselves to ending the practice on the part of the IRS of snooping through the personal tax files of American citizens. 
Recently, the GAO issued its report on IRS system security, on April 8, which was initiated at the request of Senator Glenn. The General Accounting Office concluded that the IRS has failed to effectively deal with file snooping. It says: 
Further, although the IRS has taken some action to detect browsing-- 
That word means looking at the personal tax files of American taxpayers. it is still not effectively addressing this area of continuing concern because (1) it does not know the full extent of browsing and (2) it is consistently addressing cases of browsing. 
The GAO found that the IRS still does not know the full extent of file snooping, it says: 
Because the IRS does not monitor the activities of all employees authorized to access taxpayer data . . ., IRS has no assurance that employees are not--[snooping, they use the word browsing] taxpayer data, and no analytical basis on which to estimate the extent of the browsing problem or any damage being done. 
The Internal Revenue Service stated a zero tolerance policy, with regard to file snooping. In 1993, Commissioner Margaret Richardson stated: 
Any access of taxpayer information with no legitimate business reason to do so is unauthorized and improper and will not be tolerated. 
She said: 
We will discipline those who abuse taxpayer trust up to and including removal or prosecution. 
Recent reports have documented up to 800, last year alone, files were violated, hundreds of employees have been involved--and there have been 23 suspensions. This statement that was made to the American people has not been fulfilled. That is why this legislation is here today. 
Since the IRS Commissioner made this statement, the IRS has found 1,515 additional confirmed cases of file snooping. But, as I said, only 23 resulted in job termination and only 23 percent resulted in any disciplinary action at all. Since 1991, there have been 3,345 confirmed cases of file snooping by IRS employees. 
This is reprehensible activity. These are very, very personal records and are expected to be maintained in just that way. I think the irony of this is that whenever you get at odds with IRS, you get audited. Some would say audited is a kind word. Some people feel they have been bludgeoned. But the IRS has been engaged in activity that is reprehensible and it is time for them to be audited. 
This measure, coauthored by myself, Senator Glenn, Senator Roth and others, is the beginning of an audit of IRS. It is symbolic that we pass this legislation today but it is important to note that the IRS Accountability Act comes right behind this, the IRS Accountability Act, which will deal not only with file snooping, but with random audits, balancing the ledger between the taxpayer and this agency, and putting IRS agents under the same laws as the rest of American citizens. 
Recently, the Wall Street Journal, on April 3, 1997, printed an article about IRS activities. I will quote it here. According to a Federal jury here, this gentleman:  
. . . took unauthorized looks at returns of a political opponent, [this is an IRS employee] a family adversary, and two associates in the white-supremacist movement whom, the government says, he suspected of being informers. The jury convicted [this gentleman] in December 1995 on 13 counts of wire and computer fraud, and he spent 6 months of 1996 in jail. 
Some IRS browsers apparently are merely nosy. Geoffrey Coughlin, a Houston account analyst, last year pleaded guilty to looking at more than 150 unauthorized files, including those of friends and relatives, ex-girlfriends, politicians, and sports stars. 
This is another case. Robert M. Patterson, an IRS examiner in Memphis, TN, scanned agency computers for tax records of people named Dolly Parton, Wynonna Judd, Karen Carpenter, Garth Brooks, Elizabeth Taylor--well, it is pretty clear, to understand the drift here. 
This legislation, Coverdell-Glenn-Roth, makes it a Federal misdemeanor, $1,000 fine, a year imprisonment under the Federal sentencing guidelines. A convicted offender would pay costs of prosecution and be dismissed from position where applicable. It covers Federal employees and officers, and State and other employees who have access to tax records. 
Taxpayers whose files have been accessed and are disclosed without proper authorization can seek civil action; such civil action against the United States, when the offender is a Federal employee, and against the individual offender when not a Federal employee. It requires taxpayer notification if we certify that their files have been improperly accessed or disclosed and they would be notified when the offender is charged formally. 
There are several Senators who want to speak on this measure. I notice the Senator from Ohio has arrived, the coauthor of the proposal. 
I am going to yield to the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, who has done outstanding work on this proposal.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first let me thank my good colleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn, for the extended effort and work, some of which he outlined in his statement, over a period of years to get at this problem. I appreciate his kind remarks in regard to my efforts. 
Mr. President, the fact that we have come to a situation where it has been certified by the General Accounting Office and others that employees of the Internal Revenue Service have been reviewing personal records in an unauthorized way must be stopped. The purpose of this legislation is to do just that. 
Senator Glenn also complimented the many loyal employees who work at the Internal Revenue Service, and that should be done. We would be remiss not to do so. 
Mr. President, there is a reason that half the American people are offended by this agency. The belligerence, the intimidation is well-documented, time and time again, and it is time that aura of having a standard or status that is higher than the taxpayer themselves come to an end. 
As I said, on this Senator's part, this legislation is but a beginning of the kind of accountability that I think needs to be put in place with regard to the relationship between the Internal Revenue Service and the American people. 
Somebody said today, in all the flurry of meetings, trying to resolve the differences here, that in no case should the average American citizen be frightened by an arm of their Government in the day-to-day function and relationship between people and their Government. The people should not be intimidated. They should not be fearful of this relationship. 
I will leave the individual unnamed, but not long ago I was in a commercial establishment and I was visiting with probably a 70-year-old-plus woman in Atlanta. I was completing the transaction, and she said she wondered if she might be in touch with me. I said, `Of course.' I was about to leave, so I was trying to give her my card. I said, `Here is somebody you can call to give me the details,' and she leaned over between her computer and her cash register and motioned me to come over and began whispering to me about a problem that involved her and the IRS--a 70-year-old woman, a hard worker for years and years. She was scared to death. She was whispering to me because she was frightened. That has left a mark on me. It has happened to me more than once. 
All too often the citizens that contact me with regard to problems with the IRS are of very modest means and they cannot defend themselves. They cannot protect themselves. They are frightened to death. 
I hope what we jointly, in this bipartisan effort, are doing is but, as I said, a first step. We are ending a reprehensible practice that has occurred on the part of some at the IRS, but there is much work to be done as we begin a congressional audit of the Internal Revenue Service. 
I am prepared to yield back my time and relinquish the floor for final comments from the Senator from Ohio.

 Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today, all of America celebrates the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's courageous entry into major league baseball, an event which foreshadowed and indeed paved the way for the wider integration of American society in the 1950's and 1960's. For the people of Georgia, this celebration has special significance because Jackie Robinson was born in Cairo, GA, 78 years ago. Last year, his Georgia roots were honored when the Cairo High School named its baseball stadium Jackie Robinson Field. 
The son of a sharecropper and grandson of a slave, Jackie Robinson knew poverty, adversity, and the most overt forms of discrimination. He knew especially the lonely burden of having to break the color line in baseball all by himself. Apart from remarkable athletic abilities, Jackie Robinson possessed extraordinary personal qualities which enabled him to embody the hopes and challenge the prejudices of an entire generation of Americans. He truly met the classic definition of courage--the demonstration of grace under pressure. 
Georgians and all Americans honor the history which Jackie Robinson made 50 years ago today. It is clear in retrospect that he did more than open the door of the national pastime to African-Americans. He also helped to open the door of a genuine opportunity society to all Americans. Jackie Robinson believed passionately in the promise of the American dream. Through a lifetime of hard work, personal sacrifice, and commitment to racial harmony, he did as much as any American over the past half century to help make that noble dream a reality.

Mr. COVERDELL. I believe that will be sufficient time. 
I thank the Senator from Wyoming and all the others that have visited with America this morning from the Senate floor about the consequences of tomorrow, April 15. I think perhaps that day resonates among more Americans than even our more famous holidays. 
I want to comment for a moment about the consequences of the data that was presented this morning by the Senator from Minnesota. He was talking about the impact of current taxation on American families and inferring that an average family forfeits about half of their income to taxation and the cost of Government. Specifically, we have taken a good look at this in Georgia. If you add up direct taxation--Federal Government, State and local government--and if you add on top of that the share that each family pays for the cost of regulation today, which is now approaching $7,000 per family, and if you add in the cost that an average family pays because of higher interest rates due to the national debt, which was created by the Federal Government over the last 30 years, which has spent 5-trillion-plus more dollars than it has, that adds up to 55 percent of their income. That is just stunning. And you wonder what is causing so much stress and behavioral changes in the American family? I suggest that before you look to Hollywood, you look to Washington. What else marches through their checking accounts and takes over half of what they earn? 
To put it another way, I figure if somebody is taking over half of what I earn, they probably have more to do with my life than I do. And you can see the impact on those families in the number of families that have both spouses working and the fact that the average family isn't saving any money--what would they have to save--and the fact that bankruptcies are up; the fact that consumer debt is at an all-time high; the fact that we find more children without adult supervision; that the teenage suicide rate has quadrupled from 1960 to 1990; that SAT scores have plummeted, and the fact that families are smaller. These are all phenomena that are as a result of an oppressive economic policy from their own Government. 
If you ask the American family what they think is a fair burden, it is real interesting that, no matter what economic strata they represent, they all come forward with the same answer: They think that a fair contribution for the services they receive from Government is 25 percent. So, in other words, it is over double what they think is fair. 
Madam President, let's, for a moment, say that it is at least reasonable that, at a minimum, an American family worker 
would be able to keep two-thirds of their paycheck. Most people think that is a minimum. But given today's circumstances, that is a large reach. Let's put this into real dollars. An average family in the State of Georgia--and this would equate pretty much across the country--makes about $40,000. So it makes it a lot more clear what our goal is. If we were going to adopt as a principle that we need to return to the worker at least two-thirds of the fruits of their labor to manage his or her family, that means that the goal for the U.S. Congress is to return or let them keep $8,000 more a year. That is a pretty significant undertaking. But if we set out to accomplish that, we will do enormous good. 
If we can figure out how to leave another 20 percent of that paycheck in their checking account to be talked about at their kitchen table, we will see many, many positive results. We will see larger savings. We will see new companies forming because there is capital to invest in them. The job lines will be shorter. Interest payments will be less. The family will have an opportunity to make sound judgments about educating their families. They won't have as high a consumer debt on their credit cards because they will have their own cash in their accounts. The list just goes on and on. 
I want to reiterate, what do all these numbers mean? They mean that for an average family in America, the Government is taking $8,000 out of their checking account that it really can't rationally claim and that is doing severe damage to these families--severe damage. They can't prepare for the future, for education, or retirement, or a health crisis. There is nothing left. They can barely get through the ABC's of running that family. There is no margin. You can't pick up a newspaper without reading about the distress in middle America. This is what causes it. We are choking the resources necessary for them to make healthy decisions about running their families. 
Madam President, I hope that more and more Members of Congress will just write a very simple goal on their ledger: Let's go to work and fight to ensure that an American worker can keep two-thirds of what he or she makes. Let's resolve that the fact that they keep less than half today is unconscionable. If we could line up our forefathers here and they could see what we have done to the fruits of labor, they would be stunned and they would admonish us all. 
Now is the time, in this 105th Congress, to start turning that around and leaving those resources in the checking accounts of American families. 
Madam President, I see that the hour of noon has arrived. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, James Philander Campbell made significant contributions to the State of Georgia and the Nation during his lifetime, especially in the area of agriculture. J. Phil Campbell was born in Dallas, GA, just northeast of Atlanta, on March 28, 1878. He grew up on a farm and at an early age helped enact legislation to authorize agriculture instruction in Georgia's rural schools. Mr. Campbell was a true visionary who saw the importance of agriculture to our Nation and the need to establish a comprehensive national strategy. 
Between 1908 and 1910, Mr. Campbell served as the first farm extension supervisor to the southeast region. This was done before passage of the Smith-Lever Act in 1915, which created the Federal extension service. In 1910, he began a career as the Georgia State agent for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as serving on the staff of Georgia State University's College of Agriculture. 
Mr. Campbell was the director of extension work in agriculture and home economics. In 1933, he helped assist the Agriculture Adjustment Administration with its cotton belt crop replenishment division. Shortly thereafter, he was named as Assistant Chief of the Soil Conservation Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He remained at that post until his death in December 1944. 
The legislation we have before us today, H.R. 785, sponsored by Representative Charlie Norwood, recognizes the lifetime accomplishments of Mr. Campbell by renaming a building which he was substantially responsible for creating, the Southern Piedmont Conservation Research Center, in his honor. H.R. 785 is similar to legislation which I introduced earlier this year, S. 338, which renames this center in Mr. Campbell's honor. I would like to thank my colleague in the House, Representative Norwood, for his work on this legislation, as well as Senator Cleland for his cosponsorship of S. 338 and help in facilitating the passage of H.R. 785. I would also like to thank Chairman Lugar, the staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee, the majority leader, and the minority leader for their help in enacting this legislation. 
The Southern Piedmont Conservation Research Center is located on Experimental Station Road in Watkinsville, GA. This legislation would redesignate this facility as the `J. Phil Campbell, Senior Natural Resource Conservation Center.' I would like to point out that the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] has stated that enactment of this legislation will result in no significant cost to the Federal Government or taxpayers. In addition, Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has no objections to this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Campbell's contributions to agriculture and our Nation by supporting this legislation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in just a few weeks, on April 27-29, the Presidents' Summit for America's Future will assemble in Philadelphia, cochaired by President Clinton and President Bush. This is an effort to mobilize millions of citizens and thousands of organizations to ensure a bright future for our youth and make effective citizen service an integral part of the American way of life. A number of leading corporations and service organizations have made specific commitments of resources and volunteers to achieve the summit's goal. 
The leaders at the summit will issue a great call to action for Americans, asking them to volunteer their time and efforts in community service. This is in the best tradition of America. The thread of helping your neighbor and taking an active part of civic life runs all through the history of our Nation. It is woven deeply into the fabric of our communities. It is a tie that binds us together as a robust and healthy society. 
Yet many who would heed that call to participate in the great tradition of volunteerism will not do so. Not because they lack the desire or the ability to help, but for fear of punitive litigation. In a recent Gallup study one in six volunteers reported withholding their services for fear of being sued. About 1 in 10 nonprofit groups report the resignation of a volunteer over litigation fears. 
That is why I am today introducing the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, a bill to grant immunity from personal civil liability, under certain circumstances, to volunteers working for nonprofit organizations and governmental entities. Senators McConnell, Abraham, Santorum, and Ashcroft have joined me as original cosponsors. 
This act provides that no volunteer of a nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable for harm caused by the volunteer's acts or omissions on behalf of the organization. To enjoy this protection, the volunteer must be acting within the scope of his or her responsibilities in the organization and must not cause harm by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct. 
In other words, this act provides volunteers liability protection for simple negligence only. It does not provide immunity from suit for misconduct that includes violent crimes, hate crimes, sex crimes, or civil rights violations. It does not apply where the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
It is intended to protect volunteers who make a simple, honest mistake. The injured party will still have the recourse of suing the organization itself to be made whole. Nonprofit organizations will continue to have the duty to properly screen, train, and supervise their volunteers. The organization's liability is not affected. But we will free the volunteers from fear of crushing lawsuits for mistakes made while trying to do a good deed. 
Federalism concerns arise whenever Congress takes up tort law. Our bill gives States flexibility to impose conditions and make exceptions to the granting of liability protection. It allows States to affirmatively opt out of this law for those cases where both the plaintiff and defendant are citizens of the State. 
This bill requires clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence before punitive damages may be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity because of a volunteer's actions. It also establishes a rule of proportionate liability rather than joint and several liability in suits based on the action of a volunteer. 
Mr. President, the Volunteer Protection Act will encourage the spirit of civic involvement and volunteerism that is so crucial to a healthy civil society and stronger communities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer legislation that will end one of the most pernicious offenses forced upon honest taxpayers. I am talking about file snooping. Others may call it browsing or scanning. Whatever the name, it is just plain wrong, and it ought to be stopped. That is why today I am introducing the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act. 
Too often, the Internal Revenue Service acts as a bully, enforcing the Tax Code through fear and intimidation. Even worse, legal loopholes have allowed certain IRS employees to violate the privacy of innocent citizens without punishment. Some of the most troubling abuses committed by employees of the IRS against innocent Americans include the practices of file snooping. 
Recently in the Wall Street Journal, we learned of the case of Mr. Richard W. Czubinski of Boston, MA. He is a member of the Ku Klux Klan who used his IRS job to search the tax returns of political opponents and people he suspected of being Government informers. He was prosecuted and convicted by a jury, but his conviction was overturned in the Federal Court of Appeals. In making its decision, the appellate panel found Mr. Czubinski's browsing to be reprehensible, but also found no crime had been committed because prosecutors could not prove he had used the information or disclosed it. 
In addition, a few years back, I was shocked to learn that in my home city of Atlanta, nearly 370 employees of the local IRS office were caught accessing the tax returns and return information of friends, neighbors, and celebrities without proper authorization. 
Mr. President, the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act would make it a crime to engage in file snooping, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or 1 year imprisonment. Further, a convicted offender would have to reimburse all costs of prosecution and face dismissal. 
My legislation also requires notification of taxpayers who suffer this abuse. Unfortunately, what should seem to be a simple matter of decency must be required of the IRS. In response to suggestions taxpayers be notified when their privacy has been invaded by file snoopers, IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson stated, `I'm not sure there would be serious value to that in terms of protecting the taxpayers' rights.' With all respect, such sentiment is typical of a Washington status quo mentality that is out-of-touch with the rest of America. 
Finally, my proposal would provide taxpayers who have been victims of file snooping with the option of seeking civil action. Quite simply, it is the decent thing to do. 
Taxpayer privacy is one of the most sacred trusts we place in the IRS. Unfortunately, this agency has not lived up to this trust. With passage of the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act, honest, hardworking taxpayers can be assured their full privacy will be protected every April 15. They deserve no less.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I would guess that many in the gallery today, and even some of my colleagues, are unaware of today's significance for rural America. Today is National Agriculture Day and should be a time of great reflection and celebration for all Americans. It is unfortunate that many in today's society are unaware of agriculture's daily role in their lives, but the fault for this may lie with those of us in the agricultural sector who have not properly told our story. The significance of this day is held in the tremendous, yet quiet, success story American farmers have written in building this nation. Although our agricultural community is in a period of great transition, there still can be no dispute--American farmers produce the world safest, most abundant and affordable food and fibers. This did not come by accident. American farmers, with a few exceptions, have enjoyed a positive partnership with their government. Congress has long backed vital research, promotion and insurance activities for farmers. These efforts, for the most part, need to continue in order to maintain our excellence. Just coming out of the 1996 Farm Bill, we should now carefully evaluate our work to determine where our policies have been successful and where we need work. Let's not forget that agriculture is our nation's number one export product, and in my state, is the largest industry. My point is, just like a good crop, our agriculture community needs attention. 
Now, what is the future of agriculture? I tend to believe that our future is in trade and technology. We are strategically positioned to compete and win on a world market. We are also leading the world in our ag research with many exciting advancements on the horizon. Where we need to concentrate is on the crafting of future Agriculture leaders for America. In my state, the Georgia Farm Bureau, the Georgia Agribusiness Council and the state Department of Agriculture and University, in coordination with others involved in agriculture, have teamed up to promote a program for future ag leaders. Program participants are selected for their leadership, integrity and effectiveness and are chosen in order to better communicate with non-ag leaders the many challenges facing agriculture today. This program was adopted six years ago and is called the Georgia Agri-Leaders Forum. The Agri-Leaders of Georgia are all standouts in various fields related to agriculture. They come from farms, banks, electrical membership cooperatives, commodity groups and other organizations with a common agricultural thread. These leaders should be commended for their contributions to agriculture and their service in what should be a mission to better educate America on just what her annual harvests mean to our national security and health. They are the best and brightest in Georgia agriculture each year, and I want to recognize them on this important day. The following are the class of the 1997 Georgia Agri-Leaders Forum: 
Dr. David K. Bishop, Extension Animal Scientist (University of Georgia) Tifton, GA; Roger L. Branch, Southeastern Gin Inc., Surrency, GA; Louie Canova, Floyd County Extension Director, Rome, GA; Charles Enfinger, Pineland Plantation, Newton, GA; Clint Hood, President, Allied Bank of GA;, Louisville, GA; Sam James, Regional Marketing Manager, Gold Kist, Inc., Atlanta, GA; Debra M. Cervetti Engineer, Cornerstone Engineering, Moultrie, GA; James Colson, Regional Accounts Manager, Gold Kist Inc., Valdosta, GA; Frank Dean, Vice President, North GA; Farm Credit, ACA Daniel L. Johnson, D.L. Johnson Farms, Alma, GA; Robert F. Jones, The Kroger Company, Atlanta, GA; George Larsen II, Lone Oak Plantation, DeSoto, GA; April Lavender, Georgia Forestry Association, Norcross, GA; Mary Ellen Lawson, GA; Department of Agriculture, Atlanta, GA; Dr. Daniel V. McCracken, Dept. Of Crop and Soil Science (University of GA;), Griffin, GA; Clete Sanders, S&S Farms, Forsyth, GA; Shirley Stripling, Chula Peanuts and Grain, Chula, GA; Stephen L. Morgan, ISK Bioscience, Thomasville, GA; James R. Noble, GA; Power Company, Tifton, GA; Richard L. Oliver, Area Conservationist (USDA/NRCS), Rome, GA; Lynn D. Thornhill, Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, Tifton, GA; Frank Wade, Jr., A.F. Wade CPA, Cochran, GA; 
Mr. President, I want to again recognize and congratulate this fine class of agri-leaders for their contributions to agriculture and to their country on this National Agriculture Day.

Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, first, let me thank the majority leader, the minority leader, and all of those Senators who have been engaged this morning in our efforts to move House Joint Resolution 58. Needless to say, I am very pleased that we have been able to come to this unanimous consent to consider this resolution of paramount importance as it relates to the drug cartels and the impact they are having on our country, on Mexico, and in all countries within our hemisphere. 
Madam President, I will read from a statement by Thomas A. Constantine, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, which was given before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 12, 1997. I am giving this statement as a prelude to my remarks to frame the scope of the issue to which this resolution confronts. 
Many phrases have been used to describe the complex and sophisticated international drug trafficking groups operating out of Colombia and Mexico, and frankly, the somewhat respectable titles of `cartel' or `federation' mask the true identity of these vicious, destructive entities. The Cali organization, and the four largest drug trafficking organizations in Mexico--operating out of Juarez, Tijuana, Sonora and the Gulf region--are simply organized crime groups whose leaders are not in Brooklyn or Queens, but are safely ensconced on foreign soil. They are not legitimate businessmen as the word `cartel' implies, nor are they `federated' into a legitimate conglomerate. These syndicate leaders--the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Colombia to Amado Carrillo-Fuentes, Juan Garcia-Abrego, Miguel Caro-Quintero, and the Arellano-Felix Brothers--are simply the 1990's version of the mob leaders U.S. law enforcement has fought since shortly after the turn of the century. 
But these organized crime leaders are far more dangerous, far more influential, and have a great deal more impact on our day to day lives than their domestic predecessors. While organized crime in the United States during the 1950's through the 1970's affected certain aspects of American life, their influence pales in comparison to the violence, corruption and power that today's drug syndicates wield. . . . The drugs--and the attendant violence which accompanies the drug trade--have reached into every American community and have robbed many Americans of the dreams they once cherished. 
And I add, even, in thousands of cases, their lives. 
In the face of this massive drug problem and its effect on two friendly countries, the United States and Mexico, the administration decided to certify Mexico as being fully cooperative in our joint battle. The message that sent, Madam President, to the people of both of our countries was that things are going along pretty well. They are not. In fact, they are in crisis proportions. 
We cannot accept a statement to the American people, a statement to the people of Mexico, and a statement to the people of this hemisphere that we are winning the struggle, because we are not. We are losing it in its current configuration. 
That led, Madam President, a number of the Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle, in every region of our country, and of every political and philosophical persuasion, to say no. 
That is a ratification of the status quo, and the status quo is unacceptable. It is unacceptable. 
Now, some interpret that as an attack on Mexico. I do not see it that way. I see it as an honest appraisal of a situation that is debilitating to both Republics. The President of Mexico himself has said that the greatest threat to the Mexican Republic are the drug cartels. We cannot accept the status quo. 
Madam President, House Joint Resolution 58 is a rejection of the status quo and a victory for the people of both countries who want to renew and reinvigorate this battle, to put it on a new course. Throughout the debate, I have argued that we need to find a new place to be other than just the debate over whether any country has met a criteria established by the United States as to whether they are adequately fighting the battle or not. The point is, the battle, as it has been fought, is being lost and we must find a new way to come to the struggle. I am pleased to say that in House Joint Resolution 58 there is language that is adopting my suggestion, along with that of Senator Dodd of Connecticut, that we reconstruct in the hemisphere the way we come to the battle. And it calls on the President, when he goes to Mexico and Latin America later this year, and to the Caribbean, to bring this subject up and to begin talking about how we can come together as equal partners to confront this stealth adversary that cares for no human being nor any sovereign nation. If we fought the battle in the Persian Gulf, Madam President, like we are fighting this adversary--and I might add that it is virtually as dangerous--we would have lost that struggle, as we are losing this one. We need to reinvigorate the struggle, and this proposal, which is endorsed by such a wide array of people, does just that. 
Madam President, I want to say a few words about this, because every time somebody stands up and says the status quo is unacceptable, you are immediately pushed into a category of being insensitive to those in Mexico, or other countries who were trying to help us, and, indeed, we know they are there. And no one who is an author of that resolution has it in their mind that they want to make their job more difficult. But if the only answer we get is, `Just keep this quiet, don't raise the issue,' and every time it is raised you are categorized as somebody who is offending another nation, that is inappropriate and unacceptable. 
The work that we have been doing here is absolutely on target. This country and Mexico, and all the other countries in the hemisphere, have to go public about the scope of the enemy we are struggling with. That is what this resolution does. It takes us to a new place and a new day and a more open and honest discussion in the hemisphere about this adversary. 
Technically, Madam President, this resolution will cause the administration to come to the Congress and demonstrate to us that they have renewed this battle not only in the hemisphere, but in the United States. There is a mutuality about this resolution. It acknowledges that our country is a key element in the problem. Not only are we a consumer and the No. 1 consumer of these illicit drugs, but we are a producer of the drugs themselves, and a grower of them. We have to get this on the table. If you are going to eradicate marijuana in Mexico, let's get it eradicated here. The technologists tell us we can find any of these products where they are growing. Well, let's find them and get rid of them. 
A contention that made this resolution such a struggle to come to was that the administration did not want us to come back and revisit this question later in the year. In the last hours, as the majority leader described, late last evening, that provision was removed. I think the administration needs to take note of the fact that this report will be due at just the time this Senate and this Congress will be dealing with appropriations. And the appropriators and the authorizers who have been following this for a long time are going to keep right on doing that, and they eagerly await the report. You will not be able to remove Congress from this issue, and everybody should take note of that. Every friend of the hemisphere should take note of it. 
Madam President, I hope that this is interpreted throughout the hemisphere as an instrument of assistance, good will, rededication, compassion, and concern, because that is what was in the hearts and minds of all the Senators, and others, who worked to produce this document. 
I want to particularly say thank you to Senator Feinstein, who has been at this job a lot longer than I, and I admire her work; Senator D'Amato of New York, who joined her last year; Senator Grassley, who is the chairman of our drug task force, who has worked tirelessly to deal with these problems; Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, who is a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and worked in these final negotiations; Senator McCain of Arizona; Senator Domenici of New Mexico, and, of course, our coauthor, the junior Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, who was in every step of the negotiations from the beginning. The prints of her work are fashioned into this resolution as well. I know I will have left somebody out and, for that, I apologize because it has been such a wide array of people who 
brought this resolution to the floor. 
There are many, many issues that are very important in the U.S. Congress, but I believe when you look at the hemisphere and all the opportunity in this hemisphere of democracies--40 percent of all United States exports occur in this hemisphere, which is much larger than Europe, and larger than the Pacific rim. We have a lot at stake, big time. But there is one cloud that hangs over us throughout the hemisphere, and it's the drug cartels. We have to restructure the battle. I hope this stands as a beginning to go to a new struggle and, ultimately, a victory. 
Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Do you have the resolution? Has it been submitted?

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from California leaves, I want to express my gratitude for her tireless work. I do want to mention, while she is here, a debt I believe we both owe to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Helms of North Carolina hovered over these efforts throughout, and as late as minutes before an accord was struck, personally heard out all the suggestions that had been made, compromises, and I believe was a major contributor to the conclusion by his attention, concurrence and coauthorship of this provision. I know the Senator from California would acknowledge that as well.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we are about at the hour to bring to a conclusion a very long and arduous effort to produce a positive result as we struggle with the ravages of drugs in 
our country and in Mexico and in the hemisphere. 
I want to acknowledge Senator Kyl of Arizona who has made a contribution in terms of border agents. Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms of North Carolina, for his great work and, of course, my immediate colleagues in the work, Senator Feinstein and Senator Hutchison and the staffs that have worked so long and late to produce this resolution. 
This resolution is a renewal statement. It is a new place and it changes the dynamics of the debate with regard to the drug cartels in the United States, in Mexico, and the hemisphere. 
I would simply close by reiterating my statement earlier. I hope all of our colleagues in the hemisphere, Mexico and the other countries, will understand that this is a new statement, it is an honest appraisal of a war that is ravaging the opportunities before us as we come on the new century, and see it as a new statement, a statement of renewal and reinvigorated alliance. 
Mr. President, the hour of 3 o'clock has arrived, and by the previous unanimous consent, I believe that moves us to the vote. I yield the floor.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Coverdell-Faircloth National Right to Work Act of 1997. As many of you know, my esteemed colleague from North Carolina, Senator Lauch Faircloth, introduced this language last Congress and I commend Senator Faircloth for his outstanding leadership on this issue. 
This bill does not add a single word to Federal law. Rather, it would repeal those sections of the National Labor Relations Act and Railway Labor Act that authorize the imposition of forced-dues contracts on working Americans. I believe that every worker must have the right to join or support a labor union. This bill protects that right. But no worker should ever be forced to join a union. 
I am happy to say that my own state, Georgia, is among one of the 21 states that is a `Right to Work' state and has been since 1947. According to U.S. News and World Report, 7 of the strongest 10 State economies in the nation have Right to Work laws. Workers who have the freedom to choose whether or not to join a union have a higher standard of living than their counterparts in non-Right to Work States. According to Dr. James Bennett, an economist with the highly respected economics department at George Mason University, on average, urban families in Right to Work States have approximately $2,852 more annual purchasing power than urban families in non-Right to Work States when the lower taxes, housing and food costs of Right to Work States are taken into consideration. 
According to a poll by the respected Marketing Research Institute, 77 percent of Americans support Right to Work, and over 50 percent of union households believe workers should have the right to choose whether or not to join or pay dues to a labor union. That should be no surprise. Because what this is all about is freedom. And right to work expands every working American's personal freedom. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that expands the freedom of hard working Americans and gives them the freedom to choose whether to accept or reject union representation and union dues without facing coercion, violence, and work-place harassment by union officials.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today and ask my colleagues to join me in extending condolences to the family and loved ones of Dr. Pierce Blitch, Jr., of Augusta, GA, who passed away on Wednesday, February 12, 1997. Dr. Blitch leaves a proud and indelible legacy for his family, profession, and community. He spent his professional and personal life dedicated to the field of medicine. After completing service to his country in the Navy during World War II, he graduated from the Medical College of Georgia in 1952. Dr. Blitch embarked on his medical career with an internship at University Hospital and a cardiology fellowship at Massachusettes General Hospital in Boston. He was active on staff at University Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital from 1956 until 1996. At University Hospital he served as a member of the executive committee and chief of staff and chairman of the department of medicine from 1976 until 1981. Dr. Blitch then went on to teach at the Medical College of Georgia as an instructor in the department of medicine in 1956, clinical professor of medicine in 1976 and ultimately awarded professor emeritus of medicine in 1992. He was truly a public servant and devoted leader of his field. He will remain a role model to the medical community for generations to come. I am proud of this fellow Georgian, his achievements and his contributions to our State and country. His passing is a great loss for the community.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, any time a contemporary generation is engaged in the business of consuming the resources of generations yet to come, they are in the business of abrogating the freedom of generations yet to come. This democracy was formed in a war for economic freedom and independence. As you look to the children yet to come, we are in the business of robbing them of the choices and the freedoms we have known as American people. The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is an act that must be engaged in in order to preserve the freedoms that we have known as Americans for all those generations yet to come. 
My mother and father kept 80 percent of their wages to raise their family. My sister will keep 46 percent, and her children will keep 16 percent. They will not be free as we know it. 
We need to pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have introduced today three separate joint resolutions to disapprove the President's decision to certify Mexico as fully cooperating in our war on drugs. The first joint resolution will eventually be placed on the calendar by way of rule XIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate. The second resolution is identical to the first joint resolution; however, it will be referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for their consideration. 
Finally, Mr. President, the third joint resolution I have just introduced would disapprove the President's certification and instead decertify Mexico but authorize a national interest waiver. 
Mr. President, I have been joined today by a coauthor of these resolutions, Senator Feinstein of California, who will make remarks in a moment. I will take just a few minutes to visit this subject and then yield the floor to Senator Feinstein. 
First, let me say, Mr. President, that this is a most difficult issue, and it has very broad ramifications. Mr. President, I stand here as a friend of Mexico and the Mexican people, but I believe the actions on the part of the administration were a resounding endorsement of the status quo. Mr. President, the status quo is unacceptable. The status quo sees the Government of Mexico under siege by perpetrators of fraud and corruption and destabilization. Mr. President, the status quo sees millions of new victims being ravaged by the assault of drugs within our community. I suspect that the actions on the part of the administration, of President Clinton, were an effort to be supportive of President Zedillo. I can understand that, but I believe this decision to certify without condition, versus to decertify and waive as our resolution calls for, misleads both nations. It suggests that things are going along fairly well and we just need to keep doing what we have been doing. 
The President of Mexico himself said the greatest single threat to the security of his republic are the drug cartels. Mr. President, we are losing this war. That is what the status quo represents. We are losing. The people of Mexico are losing through destabilization of their government at all levels, the American people are losing through the victimization of millions of American citizens, and the democracies of the hemisphere are losing because this is a pervasive cloud over our future as we enter the new century. 
All the opportunity one can envision about this hemisphere, the fact that 40 percent of our trade occurs in this hemisphere, the abounding opportunities that one can easily look at when you see what commerce can produce in the uplifting of all of our peoples, the single most serious threat to all those opportunities are the drug cartels. 
It hangs as a cloud, Mr. President. I believe the actions on the part of the administration do a disservice to all of our people on both sides of the border. And I hope that we can come at this question more honestly and admit that we have deep problems here, and that the good will that exists between our peoples is vibrant enough and strong enough that it can face an honest problem head on. No one is served by sweeping it under the rug for yet another year. Every day that goes by, we lose a little bit more and we come closer and closer to a time when this becomes unresolvable. 
Mr. President, we will hold hearings on these resolutions in the very near term. I compliment my colleague from California for her extended work in this area for a considerable period of time. 
At this point, I yield the floor to my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein.

Mr. COVERDELL. I have a comment on the statistics just demonstrated, because I was reading in the New York Times, and they begin the data in 1994. So it shows a slight increase. But the dramatic case that the Senator made is absolutely correct. You have to go back to 1992 and 1993 to see what really is happening with arrests and seizures of narcotics. 
I just point out that it is good that the Senator is making the point because our adversaries like to start measuring statistics in 1994. We can't do that.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a tax reform package to provide greater tax fairness and to protect citizens from Internal Revenue Service--IRS--abuses. This package includes three initiatives: a constitutional amendment called the retroactive tax ban amendment, a bill to establish a new budget point of order against retroactive taxation, and the Internal Revenue Service Accountability Act. 
The first, the retroactive tax ban amendment, is a constitutional amendment to prevent the Federal Government from imposing any tax increase retroactively. The amendment states simply `No Federal tax shall be imposed for the period before the date of enactment.' We have heard directly from the taxpayers, and looking backward for extra taxes is unacceptable. It is not a fair way to deal with taxpayers. 
In addition, I am introducing a bill that would create a point of order under the Budget Act against retroactive tax increases. Because amending the Constitution can be a very long prospect--just look at the decades-long effort on behalf of the balanced budget amendment--I believe this legislation is necessary to provide needed protection for American families from the destabilizing effects of retroactive taxation. 
It was clear to Thomas Jefferson that the only way to preserve freedom was to protect its citizens from oppressive taxation. Even the Russian Constitution does not allow you to tax retroactively. Retroactive taxation is wrong, and it is morally incorrect. 
Families and businesses and communities must know what the rules of the road are and that those rules will not change. They have to be able to plan their lives, plan their families, and plan their tax burdens in advance. They cannot come to the end of a year and have a Congress of the United States and a President come forward and say, `All your planning was for naught, and we don't care.' 
Mr. President, my third proposal is the Internal Revenue Service Accountability Act. It is wide-ranging and deals with a number of faults within the IRS that I have become aware through my constituent services work and through discussions with everyday Americans. Whenever I travel through my State, or across the Nation for that matter, concerns inevitably are raised about the IRS. This agency seems to believe the vast majority of American taxpayers are looking to cheat the Government. Instead, I believe American taxpayers are honest and hardworking, and they deserve to be treated accordingly. 
Our Nation suffers under an unfair and incomprehensible tax code that takes far too much of what we earn. Even worse, the organization responsible for enforcement of the tax code--the 
IRS--often seeks to intimidate and frighten honest citizens. We cannot tolerate a Tax Code that punishes families, and we cannot tolerate an IRS eager to bully and harass taxpayers. 
Let me briefly outline my proposal. First, the IRS Accountability Act would make agents of the IRS responsible for their actions. My legislation would make it a crime for an agent to use extortion-like tactics when collecting a tax. Agents must know there are real consequences for their actions. When they abuse their authority by maliciously and willfully disregarding the statutory procedures established for collecting taxes from honest taxpayers, they must be held accountable. 
In addition, this legislation would lift the current shield protecting IRS agents from holding any personal liability for their actions in the course of collecting a tax. I was surprised to learn that this shield remains in place even when their abusive actions result in judgments against the United States for hundreds of thousands of dollars. How ironic that American taxpayers end up footing the bill for the abuses they suffer. My legislation would end this intolerable arrangement. 
My legislation also protects the privacy of taxpayers. A few years back, I was shocked to learn that nearly 370 employees of the Atlanta IRS office were caught accessing the tax returns and return information of friends, neighbors, and celebrities without proper authorization. They were file snooping. The IRS Accountability Act would make this activity a crime and allows the offender to be held personally liable. 
Further, my legislation requires notification of any taxpayer who suffers this abuse. Unfortunately, what should seem to be a simple matter of decency must be required of the IRS. In response to suggestions taxpayers be notified when their privacy has been invaded by file snoopers, IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson stated, `I'm not sure there would be serious value to that in terms of protecting the taxpayers' rights.' With all respect, such sentiment is typical of a Washington status quo mentality that is out-of-touch with the rest of America. 
Recent reports in the press suggesting the IRS has been conducting audits for political reasons, add weight to the need for limitations on this activity. The IRS Accountability Act requires that all audits be reasonably justified. It also prohibits random audits and reauditing of returns or issues of a return unless approved by court order in the course of a criminal investigation. Further, the IRS will be limited explicitly to 3 years from the time a return is filed in which to conduct an audit unless approved by court order in the course of a criminal investigation. 
The IRS Accountability Act also would extend the time responsible taxpayers have to pay a tax without suffering a penalty. I could not say how often I hear complaints about the inaccessibility of 
the IRS. Time and time again, taxpayers cannot get answers from the IRS or even speak with a customer service agent. 
According to the IRS Taxpayer Advocate's recent report, one of the most common complaints against the IRS is its failure to acknowledge taxpayer correspondence. 
The IRS's only responses seems to be more threats and higher penalties. The IRS Accountability Act will help taxpayers by offering some needed relief. 
This legislation also preserves the integrity of judicial decisions against the IRS. This section grants a Federal court the authority to dismiss a case of controversy involving the IRS if it is shown that a similar or identical case already has been decided within the court's jurisdiction or circuit. The IRS places itself above our Federal judiciary and will choose to disregard a court decision in subsequent cases when it believes the court's decision is in error. This arrogance must be held in check. 
Mr. President, this legislation would place limits I believe are needed on the IRS when it seizes or levies assets. How many times have we heard press reports that a child's earnings from a paper route has been seized or that a child's pennies have been taken to pay the tax bill of a relative. 
In Georgia, I recently learned of an instance where the care and health of an elderly nursing home patient was jeopardized by the IRS when it seized her account to pay the tax bill of a relative. Even though it was well documented that the account contained only her Social Security benefits and were used to pay for her care, the IRS refused to relent until my office interceded. In addition, we have heard numerous examples where assets have been taken erroneously. My legislation would ensure that all levies and seizures are proper under the law and are warranted by requiring the IRS to obtain prior court approval. 
My legislation also places what I believe are reasonable limits on the accrual of interest and penalties. Specifically, it would decouple the two, preventing interest from accruing on the penalty portion of an unpaid tax bill. 
Keep in mind the IRS' track record on responding to taxpayers. According to the IRS Taxpayer Advocate, it isn't good. Now add the following to the mix: interest on the unpaid tax, penalties on the unpaid tax, and interest on the penalty on the unpaid tax. If a hardworking taxpayer is unfortunate enough to run afoul of the IRS, before he or she knows it, the tax bill has doubled, even tripled. For too many taxpayers, when they become aware a problem exists, their bill has turned into a burden they cannot hope to pay. 
Further, this legislation would equalize the interest rates charged by the IRS and against the IRS. Current law gives the IRS an advantage in interest charges over taxpayers. I believe this is predicated on the assumption that the Federal Government is more entitled to a taxpayer's income than the taxpayer. Nothing should be farther from the truth. Requiring equal rates to be charged will provide equity and bring to a close another instance where Washington thinks it knows best with what to do with families' income. 
Finally, the IRS Accountability Act provides fairness in cases of mathematical and clerical errors. For honest mistakes, the taxpayer should have an opportunity to correct it without getting slapped by a tax bill full of interest and penalty charges. Under my legislation, a taxpayer would have a 60-day grace period after notification in which to pay the unpaid tax or to file an abatement request without incurring penalty or interest charges. However, should the 60-day period elapse without the taxpayer selecting either option, penalties and interest would be owed in full. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me say what I have stated many times before on the floor of the Senate. American families already send 55 percent of their income to government in the form of taxes and other costs. Out of the remaining 45 percent, we expect them to clothe, feed, house, educate, and otherwise raise America. 
We also know that if things do not change, future generations will face a lifetime tax rate of 84 percent. Already, families are bullied and harassed by an agency eager to intimidate. How much farther would the IRS be willing to go to collect an 84 percent tax burden? The time has come to bring reason to the IRS. I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota for his remarks on behalf of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I think he makes a very poignant statement when he alludes to the condition of our children in the future. I have always enjoyed reading Thomas Jefferson's admonitions about the future of the democracy. 
I can't state it with the eloquence with which he did, but he makes the point that the Senator from Minnesota makes, and I think it is worth revisiting. He essentially said that it is morally wrong for a contemporary generation to make decisions about debt for future generations. It is morally wrong, Mr. President, for a contemporary generation to use the resources of generations yet to come. In essence, any time a contemporary generation is in the business of consuming the resources of those yet to come, they are engaged in abrogating the freedom of those yet to come, which is an unconscionable act for Americans because this is a Nation that was born in freedom and independence and has invested unlimited sacrifice to preserve it. 
Yet, we seem to want to overlook it when we look at these 28 budgets from Republican and Democratic Presidents, all of whom in their own way were a part of abrogating freedom of somebody yet to come because they all used resources of people who have no voice--nothing to say. Our legacy is to hand them debt. And how terribly inappropriate it is. 
I was reviewing some financial policy recently. I think it is called generational economics. What that means is something like this. My mother and father kept 80 percent of their lifetime wages to do the things that we have always depended on and asked for the American family to do. It has been the core ingredient in terms of taking care of America, and they raised myself and my sister; got us through school gracefully; housed us all through our medical needs and trying to prepare us for stewardship. My sister, who is 10 years younger than I, will keep about 45 percent of her lifetime wages--her parents 80 and she 45. Currently, an average family in the State of Georgia can keep, after direct taxes and cost of government, about 45 percent of their wages. So she has half the resources. A lot of it she does not get is in this pile of 28 budgets. But worst of all is the fact that a child who was born on January 1 of this year, 1997, will keep, under the current scheme of things, 16 percent of their lifetime wages. In other words, it will take 84 percent of their wages to fulfill these obligations that continue to mount. I would have to say, Mr. President, that that child born on January 1 of this year could never be considered to be free by any definition in our Constitution or in the basic tenets and fundamentals of American life. 
So from the turn of the century we have gone from a family that keeps 80 percent of the fruits of its labor to contemporarily keeping about 45 percent, to a child today faced with having to forfeit 84 percent of what their life's earnings are to fulfill the largess of all of these budgets. 
I don't know what kind of proof we need to advise us that we need to change the way we manage our financial affairs just to look at the generational impact, and then to go back and be reminded that Thomas Jefferson said what we are doing right here is an abrogation of freedom and independence and that we are in the business of denying freedom for Americans yet to come. 
The 80, 40, 16 says it all to me. If you want to just talk about monetary circumstances, we are headed toward doubling the deficit, which means we are piling more paper on this pile right here. Just in the term of this President we are going to double the deficit. We are going to add about another $100 billion to it. Then, after that, it looks like a NASA space shuttle. It just skyrockets. So the fuel and the engines of using the future resources seem unchecked and unbalanced. 
So if these 28 years of evidence are not enough to compel somebody to understand that we need to change the way we manage this debt, then you can simply look at the current budgets before us and see that we are going to continue to add debt on debt on debt. 
Sometimes when you talk to people in America about the scope of what we have been doing, about the 80, 40, and 16 percent, about the size of the current debt, which I think is $5.3 trillion looking at the big picture--of course, I have been talking about 7 minutes or so, but it is probably closer now to $5.4 trillion--it is depressing and sobering. And I always like to leave the message with more optimistic tone. 
I point out that balancing our budgets, moving to a balanced budget path, passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, does not require draconian effort. Actually, they represent modest, sound, and reasoned steps to take control of our financial affairs, which saves the country for the future, which is laudable, and for which every generation of Americans have been charged of doing--take steps to guarantee that they turn the country over to the future in good hands rather than crippled--that by taking these reasoned steps, balanced budgets, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, that it not only saves the country for the future, but it creates the immediate positive effect on every citizen today. Every family, every business, and every community has an immediate positive effect. It lowers interest rates. It makes more capital available for businesses to seek and generate more business. More businesses will be started, particularly small businesses. The job lines will be shorter. It will be easier to get a job. If you are graduating from high school or graduating from college and you are in the job market, or there has been a change, it is going to be a lot easier. 
Specifically, Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment would produce around $2,000 new disposable income, putting it into the checking account of every Georgia family, and, Mr. President, every Kansas family. I suppose the average family in our two States is pretty similar. They make about $40,000 a year. Probably both parents are working. 
And as I said, by the time the Government marches through their checking account, they have less than half of that left. That gets them down to around $20,000, $23,000 to do everything we ask them to do. 
Now, think about it. What is the effect of putting $2,000 back into that checking account? That is the equivalent of a 10-percent pay raise. And we all know the kind of stagnation that has occurred, because of this kind of activity, in those checking accounts over the last several years. 
Think of the opportunity that this creates for school and education and health care, which we have been talking so much about, for children, to have $2,000 of new resources for every average family across the country. Look at it as if you are a mayor or county commissioner. We would likely save about $333 million in lower debt service in the State of Georgia or $103 million for the capital city of Atlanta, GA. Every school district, every county, every municipality, every State will immediately begin to benefit from our taking these kinds of steps to rein in and manage our budget. 
We had a host of people down here suggesting you just do not need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution; you just need the will. I do not know how many years we have to discuss our lack of will to understand that we need to change the rules. We passed the line-item veto for the first time, and that is a new tool. That is on the right track. A lot of people were concerned: Would a Republican Congress give the Democrat President the line-item veto? They did. They did because they believed we do need new disciplinary tools to manage our financial affairs. 
I have to say that I have concluded--and I think, on balance, this is correct--if you are against a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, you are really not for balanced budgets. The President has told us we should have balanced budgets, and he ought to be supporting us in this effort. I have to say, Mr. President, that if this fails--I hope it does not; it is going to be close, but if it fails, the President will bear the responsibility for it because he has decided to fight this. The power of the President is enormous. But if you are for balanced budgets, then you are for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I do not think you know any individual, and I doubt that you know any family, nor any business, that has been successful in achieving that which it needs to do, its mission in life, that has abused his or her, their, its financial health. You just do not know anybody like that or you will not know them very long. So it is with nations. 
I was speaking yesterday to a group of foreign ambassadors and dignitaries who are visiting the United States on an educational program to try to understand our Congress, our Government, and our Nation. I told them that if you really want to understand the nature of the decisions and the environment in the United States, you have to understand her domestic financial crisis. You have to understand what the Senator from Minnesota said. He talked about the fact that the bipartisan entitlement commission has shown us that within a very short period of time, just a handful of Federal programs consume 100 percent of our Treasury. 
I was simply telling these foreign visitors that to have an appreciation for what is happening in the debate over the resources we devote to our national defense and to world order, to the debate over what we can make available to foreign assistance, it is being driven by this pile of 28 different budgets that are out of balance and that this generation of Americans, you and I, Mr. President, and all of our citizens, are going to be charged with dealing with this dilemma. We have known about this problem all these years, but it was always going to be somebody else to work it out. There is no generation for us to give the baton to. We are the last watch. It is you and I. We are going to make the decision, whether it is indecision or decision, on our watch that will determine what kind of country we give to the next generation.

Mr. COVERDELL. Let me ask this, I say to the Senator from West Virginia. The Senator from Kentucky used about 2 minutes of the time under our control, and I wonder if I might ask unanimous consent that our time last until 11:02, and I would grant 2 minutes to the Senator from Arizona and the closing 2 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.

Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, for people to remain free, they must be educated. It is at the foundation of our liberty. This bill that has just been referred owes a great debt to Senator Coats of Indiana, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, Senator Roth of Delaware, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, Senator Bond of Missouri, Senator Shelby of Alabama, and Senator Grassley of Iowa. 
Mr. President, there is a grave condition in our elementary and high schools across the land. Forty-six percent of our students have made at least one change in daily routine because of concerns about personal safety. Twenty-nine percent said it was easy to get illegal drugs. Seventy-nine percent have friends who are regular drinkers. Sixty-eight percent can buy marijuana within a day. Sixty-two percent have friends who use marijuana. 
During the last 15 years, Mr. President, tuition at 4-year public colleges and universities rose 234 percent. In contrast, median household income rose only 82 percent, putting an ever tighter squeeze on those families that choose to and desire to send their children to college. 
Since 1990, American college students have borrowed over $100 billion, and borrowing among students and families to seek their higher education has skyrocketed. 
Mr. President, since 1965, the United States has spent half a trillion dollars--$500 billion--on Federal education programs, yet 66 percent of 17-year-olds do not read at a proficient level, and reading scores have been declining for three decades. Moreover, 75 percent of fourth graders nationally scored below the proficient level of reading. 
Mr. President, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act believes that no family--no family--in America should be forced to send their student to an unsafe, violent, and drug-infested school. I repeat, no family should be forced--forced--to put their child in a school that is certifiably unsafe, certifiably drug ridden. 
This act will provide choice for children attending unsafe schools and provide an escape route from those kinds of schools. This act will ensure safe and drug-free schools and offers a grant program to those schools who are building better safety in the school place. 
It is hard to believe, Mr. President, that 40 percent of our students today do not feel safe in school. One in five are taking a weapon to school. There are 2,000 acts of violence every hour in American classrooms. 
Every student who chooses to go to college ought to have an affordable plan to do it. At the center point of this legislation is the Bob Dole Educational Investment Account. This will allow a family to put $1,000 a year, after tax, into an investment account of their choice, and when they are ready to send their child to school, the funds withdrawn from that account will occur with no tax liability. In other words, a plan setting forth, under the name of our former colleague, an opportunity for families to plan for their child's future education. 
It will provide for the deduction of student loan interest. It will protect State prepaid tuition plans. It will provide and extend employer-provided educational assistance, and it will make nontaxable work-study awards, all geared toward making it possible for that family, that student, to provide for their higher education. 
The Presiding Officer is very familiar with the Federal Government's propensity to force unfunded mandates on State and local governments. Such is the case with the individuals in the Disabilities Education Act, which was mandated by the Federal Government but never really paid for by the Federal Government. We are only making about a 7 percent to 8 percent contribution. 
This act will authorize spending up to $10 billion over the next 7 years so that the Federal Government will be a true partner in that mandate and fund upwards to 40 percent of this act that was imposed on State government, freeing those State governments of funds that they can use to better improve their educational system. 
Mr. President, when students arrive at college they ought to be proficient in the basic skills. I just cited figures that said they are not. This act will promote adult education and family literacy. The legislation provides $400 million in the form of block grants to States to establish programs to combat illiteracy. The bill creates a separate $100 million fund to provide incentive grants to encourage local innovation in addressing the problem of illiteracy. 
Mr. President, I began my remarks by saying that one of the fundamental extensions of freedom is education. This has always been the case in America. We have come to a time when the schoolroom is not safe. Therefore, the education that must emanate there is severely impaired. This education is a function of the States. The Federal Government has a role in leadership and innovation and assistance. That is at the core of this legislation we are offering today. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to describe the act today.
