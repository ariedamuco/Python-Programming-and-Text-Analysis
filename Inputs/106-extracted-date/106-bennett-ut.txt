   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the session is winding down. We are at a point where we are doing pro forma things. 
   I have neglected to do something I think is important to do and that I have wanted to do. I will take the time available to us at the moment to fulfill my obligation. 
   I wish to pay appropriate tribute to the senior Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, on the occasion of his retirement. I have already done this within the committee on which we jointly sit, but I think at a more formal setting it is also appropriate. 
   I first met PAT MOYNIHAN when I was serving in the Nixon administration. He was then a member of the White House staff. I was serving in the Department of Transportation. He was the President's primary enforcer, if you will, of improvements and efficiencies in the executive branch, particularly in domestic departments. We at the Department of Transportation were a little bit in awe, if not in terror, of the thought of PAT MOYNIHAN showing up and checking on us to make sure we were doing things right. 
   I remember one meeting in the White House where we were outlining what we wanted to do, that which I considered to be fairly bold, and listening to MOYNIHAN saying: Well, in a Republican administration, this is probably about the best you could expect. He wanted us to be considerably bolder than we were. He wanted to go into directions of new initiatives that would have been very good for the country. 
   In addition to this, he was one of the architects of Nixon's program of family maintenance which, had it been enacted over the objections of the Democrats, probably would have solved many of our welfare problems. 
   Mr. MOYNIHAN was well respected then. President Nixon later used him as Ambassador to the United Nations and Ambassador to India. When he was running for a seat in the Senate, even though he was a Democrat, I, for one, was rooting for him to win. 
   I have just finished reading a book called ``The Trust,'' which is the history of New York City. I was interested to find that the editorial board of the New York Times almost unanimously decided that in that primary they were going to endorse Bella Abzug for the Senate seat in New York. Fortunately, the publisher of the New York Times, Punch Sulzberger, came to his senses long enough to dictate a New York Times endorsement of PAT MOYNIHAN, and this body was spared the experience of having Mrs. Abzug as the Senator from New York. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN and I have disagreed about a number of issues since we have been here. We have debated on many issues and clashed many times, but we have served together in many areas. He was a member of the Senate Y2K committee, a committed, active member who scheduled hearings in his home State of New York. We went there often. I was always impressed and uplifted by the amount of bipartisan support he gave to that effort. He was always well informed and completely without guile or without bitterness. 
   He now goes on to a career he loves, which is teaching. I have read some of his books and wish I could be one of his students. 
   This country will hang on to PAT MOYNIHAN as a major resource and a national treasure for the remainder of his life. But we in the Senate have been well served by having him here as our colleague. 
   One last thing I will say about PAT MOYNIHAN, which is little known but which demonstrates the man, there is a story going around in Washington that says when John F. Kennedy went down Pennsylvania Avenue in his inaugural parade, he saw how shabby the avenue was, and with that vision often attributed to the Kennedy clan, he said we must do something to clean up Pennsylvania Avenue, and the restoration of Pennsylvania Avenue then occurred. Well, in fact, from the scholarly writings of PAT MOYNIHAN, we find that it was not John F. Kennedy at all; it was Arthur Goldberg, who was in that parade and saw that shabbiness of Pennsylvania Avenue, who pointed it out to President Kennedy and, to his credit, the President said, ``Yes, let's do something about it.'' But he probably gave it no more thought than that. 
   The assignment of seeing that something was done to the Nation's most monumental avenue ultimately fell to a young staffer named PAT MOYNIHAN. It was he who drove the effort to see to it that Pennsylvania Avenue was cleaned up from the pawnshops and the other shabby architectural edifices that were there to the monumental avenue that it is today. Interestingly enough, it was while he was chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, leaning on the public works side of that environment, where he led the effort within the Congress to see to it that the necessary money was appropriated to build the monumental buildings of which we are all so proud. 
   So we have a lasting architectural legacy to the public career of PAT MOYNIHAN right here in the District of Columbia. I, for one, shall miss him. But I look forward to staying in touch with him as he tells me that he is going to stay in the Washington area and teach. I hope that at some point, when my career in the Senate ends, he is still teaching and I can take one of his classes. It has been a great privilege to  serve in the Senate with the senior Senator from New York.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been remiss in not taking the floor to pay tribute to the Senator from Nebraska for his service here. The presentation we have had, although I disagree in some detail with some of the aspects of it, demonstrates how much we will miss him. The Senator from Nebraska has been a key figure in the group that has been known variably around here as the Centrist Coalition, or Chafee-Breaux, or the group that tries to get together across partisan lines and work things out. 
   As I sat in the chair and listened to the Senator from Nebraska, I realized if he and I could sit down in a room, between the two of us--and not have the White House there, and not have the leadership there of either House--we could arrive at a conclusion that I think he would be satisfied with, I would be satisfied with, and I think would be good for the country. 
   I think that comes from the fact that he has a business background and I have a business background. In business, you are not as interested in ideology as you are in getting the thing solved. 
   So I atone for my past failure and say publicly that this body will miss the Senator from Nebraska. This particular Senator considers him not only a good friend but a wise legislator, and I think the country has been well served as a result of his willingness to give these two terms to the Senate. I wish him well in whatever endeavor he undertakes in the future. 
   I say to the Senator from Nebraska, if he should decide to seek the Presidency once again, I would cheer for the Democratic Party to choose him as their nominee. I may not vote for him, but I would feel more reassured if he were the alternative on the other side.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Texas for that most enlightening presentation. I agree with him we probably should not be debating the Presidential race on the floor. 
   I noticed the Senator from Massachusetts comes to the floor every day and talks about education, very often giving the same speech using the same set of charts. So I have decided I ought to respond to some of those charts to set the record straight. 
   One of the charts which the Senator from Massachusetts uses shows the increased school enrollment in the Nation, and he uses it to justify the Democratic position that we ought to require spending for new school construction. He says: Where are these students going to be housed if we do not pass this bill in the Federal Government that will mandate school construction? 
   We Republicans have always said we are willing to spend the money on education. Make no mistake, we are not talking about dollars here. Indeed, the bill that is working its way through the process and may come to the floor this week has more money for education than the President initially requested. Understand that. We are not talking about dollars, we are talking about control. Who is going to control the spending of those dollars? Will it be the Federal Government or will it be the people in the local areas? 
   I came across this chart, which I have had reproduced. It demonstrates what is happening with the percentage changes in public elementary and secondary school enrollment. The Senator from Massachusetts has a chart showing enrollment going up, and I agree with that, but this is a different chart, and it comes from the U.S. Department of Education. This, obviously, is not Republican propaganda. This comes from the administration. It breaks down school enrollment by region.  
   You will notice that there is an increase in school enrollment in the West, where I live. It shows an increase from 1988 to 1998 and a projected increase from 1998 to 2008. It is a tremendous increase. 
   There is an increase in the South. This shows the increase from 1988 to 1998 and the projected increase from 1998 to 2008. 
   But when we go to the Northeast, we find that the projection is the other way. 
   In the Northeast, the projected percentage change in public elementary and secondary school enrollment is going down, not up; and in the Midwest, it is going down, not up--down by an even greater amount. It has gone up less than any other region in the 10-year period prior to 1998, and will go down more than any other region in the years from 1998 to 2008. 
   When you see the breakdown coming from the Department of Education, I think you see the flaw in the argument of the Senator from Massachusetts. And I think you see the reason to support the position the Republicans have taken. Yes, we need new school construction in this country, but we do not need it everywhere. We do not need it mandated from Washington. Washington, I have discovered, has a way of adopting formulas. Boy, have I learned about formulas since I have been in the Senate. 
   We had a debate on this floor about funds to address class size, and everyone was saying: We must reduce class size if we are going to improve education. I am all for reducing class size. Then I looked at the formula, and I discovered a very interesting thing. Do you know the State that has the largest class size? It is a tossup. Sometimes it is California; sometimes it is Utah. 
   When I looked at the formula for how Washington would allocate the money that we were supposedly adopting to reduce class size, I found that it had nothing whatever to do with class size. It was a formula based on poverty, and States that already had smaller class sizes would get most of the money for the purpose of reducing class sizes. And my State, which vies for having the largest class size, would get precious little of that money. 
   So I opposed that proposal. And I got beaten up in my campaign: Senator BENNETT, you are not in favor of reducing class size because you didn't vote for the proposal. I said to my opponent: Read the bill and you will find that it would not have done much for Utah. Once you got past the title, it had little to do with reducing class size where enrollments are highest. 
   The same thing is true here. We are talking about the need for new construction, but are we going to have a Federal formula that will determine how the money is allocated per State? Every State, I guarantee you, will get money to increase school construction, including States in the Northeast, where enrollment is projected to go down, not up. The money would be allocated the way Washington allocates, and those of us in the West would get hurt. 
   We need to understand that when we use these educational slogans about ``we must build new schools because our enrollment is going up,'' we are glossing over the issue, and we are not paying attention to what it really is. This is why I am proud to be supporting the Republican position that says: Federal spending for education, yes. Federal dominance of education, no. Increased money from the Federal Government for the districts that need it, absolutely. Federal dictating to the districts, no. 
   So every time the Senator from Massachusetts shows us his charts and tells us about enrollments going up, let's remember that enrollments are not going up uniformly. Enrollments are going up differently. If we pass the bill that the Senator from Massachusetts daily demands that we pass, I'm afraid that those of us in the West would get shortchanged, those in the South would get shortchanged, and those in the area of the Senator from Massachusetts would get extra money at the expense of the rest of the country. 
   Should we spend more money on education? Yes. Should we dictate it from Government? No. Ignoring local needs is not good for education. It is not good for our schoolchildren. It would not be the smart thing to do. 
   Now, with regard to another education issue, I have listened to the Senator from Massachusetts attack Texas. 
   Yesterday, I pointed out that the quoting of the Rand report as a vehicle for attacking Texas demonstrated that someone had not 
   read the Rand report. I pointed out that the President of Rand himself said, as the second report was issued, that it did not negate the findings of the first report, which said that Texas was No. 1--that Texas had done the best job--in a number of areas. 
   When the second report came out, which dealt with Rand's analysis of the Texas test procedures, the President of Rand said, this is not in conflict with our earlier findings that said that Texas leads the Nation in increases in improvements in education. But those who use the Rand report to bash Texas did not bother to quote the President of Rand, did not bother to look at the earlier Rand report; they just picked out those things that they thought would be good for them. 
   So it has been injected into the Presidential campaign, whether we like it or not. And in that spirit, I went to the web site of Gore-Lieberman, Inc. to find out some of the things that we could expect from Vice President GORE if he were elected. I found some very interesting things. 
   I now refer to the Gore-Lieberman web site. It states that GORE would test students with real tests for real accountability. He would require testing to measure achievement and attach real consequences to the results of those tests. 
   I find that very interesting. Is the Federal Government going to write the tests? And is the Federal Government going to mandate the test and come down on schools that do not meet the achievements of the tests? And what are the real consequences that he is talking about? 
   In the campaign, sometimes the rhetoric can get fuzzy. But this is the one I find most interesting: GORE would offer choice of high-caliber preschool. He would make high-quality voluntary preschool available to all 4-year-olds so that every family can have a choice in preschool. 
   Dare I use the hated word, Mr. President? Are we talking about ``vouchers''? Are we saying that money would go to families for a choice in preschool that would be funded by the Federal Government? Are we talking about the Department of Education mandating preschool availability to every 4-year-old in the country, and then following that 4-year-old with some money? Are we talking about the GI bill for 4-year-olds? 
   Congress passed the GI bill after the end of the Second World War, and established the precedent that the money goes with the student, not to the school. That is a precedent I applaud. All of those who talk about vouchers in elementary and secondary schools say it is terrible that you might spend money on a religious school, that it violates the separation of church and state. I did not notice that with the GI bill. 
   With the GI bill, if a veteran wants to take the money and go to Notre Dame and study to be a Catholic priest, the Federal Government says: It's none of our business. We are giving you the money. You go where you want. 
   So I ask the question: When the Vice President says that he would make available high-quality voluntary preschool to all 4-year-olds, would he object if a 4-year-old decided to go to a Montessori school, a Montessori school where he might learn a little bit of Catholic history? Would we have that happen under the program that is touted on the Gore-Lieberman, Inc. web site? What do they mean when they say preschool for all 4-year-olds? We have not had any indication of how much that is going to cost or how that would be administered in the Department of Education. 
   Based on past experience, I am afraid how it would be administered, that it would take us back into the same morass I was referring to with respect to this chart. We would see a Federal program that does not address real needs. That would be the case with school construction. That would be the case, by the way, in the proposal for 100,000 new teachers. We looked at the proposal of 100,000 new teachers in the State of Utah. We can use new teachers in the State of Utah. 
   Everyone can use new teachers. We found out that the program for 100,000  new teachers would give us a few additional teachers per school district--not per school, per school district. We have school districts in Utah that have 100,000 students in them. We would get a few additional teachers for each school district in the State of Utah. 
   The thing I am afraid of is that with even one additional teacher would come a whole host of Federal controls, a whole host of Federal requirements. As I have said on the floor before, I was lured back into public life, away from my business career, when I was asked to serve as chairman of the Strategic Planning Commission for the Utah State school board. I found out the degree to which the Federal Government controls local decisions. The Federal Government puts up 6 percent of the money, but controls 60 percent of the decisions. I didn't like that when I had nothing to do with elective politics, when I was just serving a public service responsibility trying to improve education. I don't like it now, when I am in a policy position. I don't think it is sound policy. 
   I think you are going to see the same kind of thing apply to this suggestion from ``Gore-Lieberman, Inc.'' that says there will be preschool available to all 4-year-olds. I think the process would be that the Federal Government might put up 6 percent of the money and make 60 percent or more of the decisions. I am guessing because we don't have any of the specifics. 
   Let me leave the education issue and make one final observation in response to the comments of the senior Senator from Texas. He talked about tax cuts and how, in fact, they benefited people other than the rich. 
   Let me give, if I may, briefly, my own experience. This is not theoretical. This is not out of some think tank. This is not some group of academics. This is a real experience of a real person in real life. 
   It was in 1984 that I received a phone call from a friend of mine in Salt Lake City. At the time I was living in California. I was asked: Would you come to Salt Lake and consult with us as we try to start a little business? 
   At the time I flew to Salt Lake to sit down with those people to talk about that business, they had four full-time employees. They were literally operating out of the basement of the man who had the business card that said he was the president of that company--a grandiose title, a lot of dreams, and four people. Mr. President, 1984 is smack in the middle of what we have heard some people call ``the decade of greed,'' because that was the period of time when the top marginal tax rate was 28 percent. And that is terrible, some people said, because the rich are getting by only having to pay 28 percent on their income. 
   Well, I moved to Utah. I became the president of that company. We grew that company through the decade of greed with internally generated funds. The reason we were able to grow that company with internally generated funds is because we filed as an S corporation under the tax law, which meant our top tax rate was 28 percent. That meant for every dollar we earned trying to get that company going, we could keep 72 cents to fund its growth. 
   The company today has over 4,000 employees, 1,000 times what it had when it was founded. The company pays millions of dollars today in corporate income tax. The suppliers that supply goods to that company pay millions of dollars in corporate income taxes. Those 4,000 employees of the company pay millions of dollars in income tax. If you will, that company is making its significant contribution to today's surpluses as those millions and millions of dollars come into the Federal Treasury. 
   If the top corporate tax rate, top effective tax rate, had been 39.6 percent, as it is today, instead of 28 percent, I can tell you from firsthand knowledge that we could not have grown that company in that atmosphere. Instead of keeping 72 cents out of every dollar we made in order to grow the company, if we had only 
   been able to keep 60, that extra 12-cent difference would have sunk us. I know. I sweat over the books. I worried about meeting payroll. I worried about cash-flow. 
   It is the harvest of the seeds that were planted in the decade of greed that are now producing the tremendous income that is coming into this economy. Look at the companies that have built over time and ask how many of them were started in the period when the tax rate was lower and paid S chapter funds. 
   When I first came to the Senate, I tried to explain how all this worked. I asked the question on the Senate floor: Is there anybody here who understands what a K-1 is? I asked the question when the chairman of the Budget Committee at the time was on the floor. He was debating the tax structure. He had no idea what a K-1 was. I asked others in my own party: Does anybody know what a K-1 is? They had no idea. They knew what a W-2 was. That is the form that indicates your wages. But they didn't know what a K-1 was.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his courtesy. I was more than happy to give him whatever leeway he wanted, but I appreciate the opportunity to make a comment. Given the nature of the session in which we find ourselves, we have to take every opportunity as it comes along. As the chairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from Kentucky, indicated, the time will be taken off the bill. 
   I rise to take the opportunity to respond to the comments that were made earlier by the Senator from Massachusetts in his scathing attack on the education system in Texas. The Senator from Massachusetts, as well as Senator HARKIN yesterday, referred to a Rand Corporation study on the State of Texas schools. They would have us believe that based on that study, the Texas schools are terrible and, further, that those of us who are saying nice things about Texas schools are deliberately misleading the public. 
   I want to make it clear that the people who are missing this story are the people who sit in the gallery above the Chair. The press has missed the story here because they have bought the line laid down by the Senator from Massachusetts and others in his party that somehow the Rand Corporation has denounced Texas schools as being terribly inferior. The Rand Corporation has done no such thing. Democrats  have used the recent Rand study to try to tell everybody that the Rand Corporation has done that. If I may, too many journalists have taken the press release as it has come out of the Democratic headquarters and not read the record for themselves. 
   I took a class in journalism. The first thing they said was, check the facts yourself. I didn't follow that career, but 
   I have tried to remember that advice. So I have checked the facts myself. The place I went to begin with, with the help of my staff, was the Rand Corporation. Let us go back to the Rand Corporation and see what they have to say about Texas schools. I will leave aside the argument as to whether or not they are right. There is always the possibility that even these so-called experts could be wrong in their analysis. Let us set that aside for just a minute and ask ourselves, what does the Rand Corporation have to say about Texas schools?

   Mr. BENNETT. The Rand Corporation says:  
   The education reforms of the 1980s and 1990s seem to be working, according to a new RAND report, but some states are doing far better than others in making achievement gains and in elevating their students' performance compared with students of similar racial and socioeconomic background in other states. Texas and Indiana are high performers on both these counts.  
   I will repeat that last sentence:  
   Texas and Indiana are high performers on both these counts.  
   This is not a Republican speaking. This is not the Bush campaign speaking. This is the Rand Corporation speaking. Texas, a high performer. 
   It goes on:  
   Math scores are rising across the country at a national average rate of about one percentile point per year, a pace outstripping that of the previous two decades and suggesting that public education reforms are taking hold. Progress is far from uniform, however. One group of states--led by North Carolina and Texas and including Michigan, Indiana and Maryland--boasts gains about twice as great as the national average.  
   This is the Rand Corporation, Mr. President, saying Texas is boasting rates of improvement twice the national average. 
   Back to the report:  
   Even more dramatic contrasts emerge in the study's pathbreaking, cross-state comparison of achievement by students from similar families. Texas heads the class in this ranking with California dead last.  
   Interesting. They go on to say:  
   Although the two states are close demographic cousins, Texas students, on average, scored 11 percentile points higher on NAEP math and reading tests than their California counterparts. In fact, Texans performed well with respect to most states. On the 4th-grade NAEP math tests in 1996, Texas non-Hispanic white students and black students ranked first compared to their counterparts in other states, while Hispanic students ranked fifth. On the same test, California non-Hispanic white students ranked third from the bottom, black students last, and Hispanic students fourth from the bottom among states.  
   How can this be, for the Rand Corporation to be saying such wonderful things about Texas and then having Democratic Senators come to the floor and quote the Rand Corporation as saying 
   terrible things about Texas? If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would think the release of the latest Rand study might have something to do with the fact that there is an election in less than a week. But the president of the Rand Corporation has insisted that is not the case. He has insisted that the timing of the release of this second study, which is being used to trash Texas, was entirely coincidental and had nothing whatever to do with the election. 
   All right. Let's take him at his word and read his words to see how he reconciles the earlier Rand statement with the later one. I didn't tell you, but that first study I quoted from was released in July, before either of the conventions took place, before the question of Texas performance in education became a national priority or a national issue. 
   How does the president of Rand reconcile these two apparently irreconcilable positions, one where Rand says, in July, Texas is No. 1, Texas comes in first with California last, and the two States are demographically very similar--how do they reconcile that statement with the statements we are hearing on the floor today? 
   Read what he has to say, I say again to my journalist friends, who take the press release from the Democratic headquarters, put it in the headlines--top story in today's television--that the Rand Corporation has trashed the Texas record. I don't think any of them read what the president of Rand had to say because if they had, the story would have been different on this morning's news. 
   This is what he has to say:  
   The July study ``Improving Student Achievement'' touched on the Texas schools and received widespread press play. Both efforts--  
   Talking about the July study and this last one--  
   draw on NAEP scores. The new paper suggests a less positive picture of Texas education than the earlier effort, but I do not believe these efforts are in sharp conflict. Together, in fact, they provide a more comprehensive picture of key education issues.  
   So Rand is not backing away from their earlier statement that Texas is No. 1 in the areas that they quoted and covered in their first statement. They are not repudiating that. 
   They are not contradicting it. They are not backing away from it. Again, the president of Rand says:  
   I do not believe that these efforts are in sharp conflict.  
   It is the politicians who have put them in sharp conflict, not the researchers. Let's examine the research and see what it says. Quoting again from the president of Rand:  
   The July report differed in scope.  
   Then in parentheses he says:

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest to my colleague from Massachusetts. I am always interested as he holds forth on these issues about which he feels passionately, and I congratulate him on his passion. 
   I have a similar commitment to education but a rather different view of things. Let me review again, as I have in this Chamber before, my own experience with respect to education that causes me to come to a different opinion and a different position than that of the senior Senator from Massachusetts. 
   As I have related to the Senate before, I was happy in a business career when I received a phone call that asked me to serve as chairman of the Strategic Planning Commission of the Utah State Board of Education. That got me into educational issues and actually started me down the road out of corporate life and into public life, ultimately leading me here to the Senate. 
   Apropos of the things that the Senator from Massachusetts has said, I share an experience I had that resonated with the comment that Governor Bush made the other night. The Senator from Massachusetts has already referred to the debate between the two Presidential candidates, so I think it is appropriate I should go there, as well. 
   We started, in my education about what happens in education by talking about the money. That is always a good place to start. Start with the numbers, start with the dollars. The dollars pretty much drive everything else. 
   I looked at the various things that were being done in the State of Utah, some of which struck me, as a businessman, as being maybe a lesser priority than some other areas. I asked the question: Who sets the priorities? Who determines that we spend more money on topic A than topic C? I was told, that is the Federal Government. The Federal Government puts up matching funds and requires that the States come up with their match, and the Federal Government determines that topic A will be topic A, topic B will be topic B, and so on. 
   I looked at some of the programs. I said, we would be better off in Utah if we spent that money on something else. Our needs in Utah are different than the needs in other States. Maybe it is nice to have the Federal dollars, but why don't we tell the Feds, sorry, we won't take your dollars for topic A, because for us topic C or topic D should be topic A, so we will forego the Federal dollars, and we will take the money that we have been forced to put up as matching dollars and spend it on our priorities. 
   The fellow who was briefing me on this kind of smiled at how naive I was, how foolish a notion that was. He said:   
   You can't do that. The Federal Government will sue you and will win. They have already sued States that tried to do that and won.  
   So if the Federal Government says this is what you have to spend your money on, then you have no choice but to do that, even if it is not in the best interests of the schoolchildren in your State. 
   That was a disappointing thing for me to realize, but I thought: OK, we are dealing with 50-cent dollars here, at least. We are putting up matching funds. So the Feds put up 50 cents and we put up 50 cents, so it is not hurting us quite as badly to be spending 50-cent dollars on a project we would not have chosen. 
   Once again, smiles of indulgence on the part of the fellow who was briefing me. He said:  
   No, no, you don't understand, BOB. The State doesn't put up 50 cents. The State puts up 80 cents, the State puts up 90 cents. When we say matching dollars, we don't mean matching dollar for dollar; we mean the Feds put up 5 percent or 10 percent or, if they are feeling really generous, 15 percent or 20 percent. But the States are required to put up the rest of it.  
   I thought: That is really not fair. That is not a good deal. That is controlling the direction of education everywhere with a small amount of money. I thought: There is something wrong with that. I looked into it. I found that the only program where the Federal Government puts up half or more of the money in so-called matching funds is school lunch--which is not an educational program; it is a welfare program. I have nothing against school lunch. Indeed, I recognize that there is a great need for school lunch. I am a supporter of school lunch. But let us not stand here and say that, because the Feds put up more money for school lunch percentagewise than anything else, they are making a major contribution to education. 
   When Governor Bush was speaking about this the other night, he made this point that went by many people but that I would like to focus on here. He said the Federal Government puts up about 6 percent of the money but they control--if my memory is correct from what the Governor said--60 percent of the strings. 
   I don't know whether that 60 percent is exactly right, but it is in the ball park, and I will use that figure because that is what my memory says. Six percent of the money, but they control 60 percent of the strings that are attached to that money. So the people in Utah, Colorado, or Arizona or, yes, Massachusetts, have to jump through the Federal hoops with the 96 cents that they put into every dollar spent on education, jumping through at the dictate of the people who put up the 6 cents. 
   Here is the fundamental difference we need to confront when we have this debate on education, the fundamental difference between the Republicans and the Democrats, between those who are demanding we put more money into the present system, as does the Senator from Massachusetts, and those who are saying let's experiment a little bit. The fundamental difference is, Who should be allowed to call the shots? The people closest to the problem, the people facing the children day by day, the people administering the schools on a regular basis in their home 
   communities? Or the people in Washington, DC? Who should make the ultimate decisions about education? 
   Let me make it clear, I am not calling for the abolition of the Department of Education. The senior Senator from Massachusetts would seem to be very upset that somebody suggested we abolish the Department of Education. I have never made that suggestion, so I am on his side on that one. I agree there should be a voice at the Cabinet level talking about education. But I do not think the voice at the Cabinet level that is talking to the President about education should be the voice at the school board level, talking to the principal of the school where my grandchildren go about education. 
   I have to talk about my grandchildren now because all of my children have graduated. All of them are out of school, out of college, raising families, pursuing careers. But there was a time with six children--seven, actually, because we had a foster child in our home for 4 years--when I spent a lot of time at school board meetings. I went to school board meetings and listened to them discuss the budgets. I recognized that there were differences within the school district, between schools. I heard them debate about how they were going to take care of problems in this middle school that were different from problems in that middle school. I recognize that is where the rubber meets the road. That is where the decisions have to be made. That is where the problems really arise. 
   I do not think there is anybody in Washington who can differentiate between the problems in this middle school in the Las Virgenes School District in California, where my children went, and that middle school in Las Virgenes School District in California where my children went. I don't think there are very many people in Washington who have ever heard of the Las Virgenes School District in California where my children went. That is the issue. That is what we are talking about. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts says the Republicans don't care about Massachusetts because all they do is block all of our efforts to go forward with a massive Federal program in education. Yes, we do try to block some of those efforts. Not because we are saying the Federal Government should have no role in education, but we are saying the Federal Government should begin to trust people at the local level to make their own decisions. It is a fundamental difference. We saw it in the debates the other night. We are saying it on the floor now. 
   Whom do you trust? Do you trust the Federal Government and the Federal bureaucracy and the Federal Department of Education as the ultimate authority as to what should be done or do you trust the people who are closest to the problem to decide what should be done? It should be a partnership, not a dictatorship. It seems to me someone who puts up 6 percent of the money, who then controls 60 percent of the decisions, is getting close to dictatorship and not partnership. 
   At the State level, I found myself resenting it. Now that I have come to the Federal level, I bring that bias with me. I continue to resent it. I continue to think we would be better off if we said those who are putting up 6 percent of the money have an opinion, have a role to play, they have a function they can perform that no one else can perform, but when it comes to the nitty-gritty of the daily decisions, those who are putting up 6 percent of the money should yield to the decisionmaking power of those who are putting up 94 percent of the money and doing virtually 100 percent of the work. 
   Let's look at this Congress. The Senator from Massachusetts attacked the record of this Congress on education and said we have not done anything. We have. For example, we passed the education savings accounts which would have put more power in the hands of individuals and parents. Once again, the fundamental difference: Whom do you trust? 
   The education savings account bill, which was cosponsored by the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, would have put more power in the hands of individuals, and the President vetoed it. The President vetoed an education bill on the grounds that it would have taken power away from the Washington establishment and put power in the hands of the parents. 
   It is not fair to stand here on this floor and say, regardless of the decibel level at which you say it, that this Congress has done nothing about education, because we have passed education bills that the President has vetoed and he has vetoed it on this basic issue. 
   Straight A's: This is a bill, we call it the Academic Achievements for All Act--Straight A's Act. It was supported by the Senator from Georgia who used to occupy this place on the Senate floor, Mr. Coverdell. 
   The Democrats blocked it. The Democrats said the President will veto it. The Democrats said: No, we cannot allow this kind of flexibility at the local level. We must continue to dictate to the local people what will happen with respect to education. 
   Once again, those who put up 6 percent of the money control 60 percent of the strings, and they are using their 6 percent of the money to dictate to the people at the local level how things should be.  
   I remember the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We have had that debate. I regret that it did not result in the passing of the act, but one of the reasons it did not result in the passing of the act was because of blocking efforts on the part of the Democrats to a Republican proposal that would have given States, on an experimental basis, the opportunity to try something new. There was no dictating in the position of the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, that said States have to try this. His amendment said if a State thinks the present system is wonderful, the State can continue to receive money with the present system. They can continue to accept those 60 percent of the strings. They can continue to do exactly what they are doing. 
   What if a State does not want to do it quite that way? What if a State wants to experiment in a very tentative fashion with something new? Let's give them the opportunity to try it. The senior Senator from Massachusetts was one of the first to take the floor and roar that we must not allow that kind of experimentation. We must not allow anyone to try anything different. 
   Look at the States that are making progress. And, yes, look at the State of Texas. Look at the progress that has been made among Hispanic students, the progress that has been made among black students--the progress that has been made among minorities generally in the State of Texas. It leads the national average. It is a record of extremely beneficial accomplishment, and it is taking place in the early grades where it needs to take place because if you wait until the time they get to the SAT scores, it is too late. 
   If you want to look at SAT scores, you are looking at high school students, and the high school students in Texas were cheated by the administrations in Texas that were there prior to the time Governor Bush took over. It is in the lower grades where they are seeing the fruits of the activities in Texas where they are trusting people, trusting the locals, giving the opportunities that need to be given to those who need education the most. 
   The white middle-class suburban kids do pretty well in this country in almost every State in which they live. The real educational crisis is among the minorities. The real educational crisis is among those people who live in the inner cities and do not have the opportunities that come to the white middle-class suburban kids. Let's be honest and straightforward about that. 
   It is very interesting. Who has led the fight, which seems to upset the senior Senator from Massachusetts more than any other, for experimentation with vouchers? It has been Polly Williams, an inner-city representative of a minority, a black member of the State legislature. She comes from Milwaukee, and she has led the fight not for the rich, not for the upper 1 percent, not for the other groups that have been demonized in 
   this political campaign. She has led the fight for poor inner-city kids. She has won the fight, and the fight in Milwaukee is over. If you run for an educational position in Milwaukee now, you better be for vouchers because the public has seen it and has embraced it, and it is now the strong majority position. 
   It comes down to this fundamental question when we talk about money: Do you want to fund the individual or do you want to fund the system? We say let's fund the individual and let the individual take the money wherever he wants to go. They say: Oh, no; that's terrible. He might take it to a--dare we say it?--religious school. He might take the money in such a way that violates the separation of church and State. We can't have that. 
   In what is considered the most successful social program since the Second World War, we did exactly that. We gave the money to individuals, and we said to them: We don't care what you do with it; just use it to get an education. I am talking, of course, about the GI bill. When we said to the GIs who came home from World War II, ``We are going to give you money to go to school,'' we did not say, ``We are going to pick the institutions that will receive this money and then you go petition for it.'' We just said if they served in the Armed Forces, they have the money under the GI bill of rights. And if they wanted to go to Notre Dame and study to be a Catholic priest, they could do that and nobody was going to claim that was somehow a violation of the separation of church and State. 
   We said if they want to take the money and go to Oral Roberts University, they could do that. It may well be Oral Roberts University did not exist under the GI bill--I am not sure--but the principle still holds. If they wanted to go to Harvard, if they wanted to go to Wellesley, if they wanted to go to Ohio State University, or if they wanted to go to Baylor or Southern Methodist--they pick the school and the money follows the individual, giving the individual power, and America is the better for it. That is what we are talking about here. The money should go where it will do the individual the most good and not be controlled out of Washington that puts up 6 cents out of every educational dollar and then wants to make 60 percent of every educational decision. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, this morning there was a meeting of the Joint Economic Committee on which I sit. The subject had to do with oil prices. I would like to report to my fellow Senators and any who may be watching on television some of the things we found out. 
   The first thing that became clear was that the oil crisis that we are dealing with now did not occur in the last 60 days. It has been building for months. Indeed, the conditions have been building for years. 
   One of the things that I found distressing was a comment made by one member of the committee whose suggestion was that anyone who disagreed with what the President and the Vice President are currently proposing should be challenged with this question: What is your solution? And if the answer was you don't have an easy solution, then stop complaining about our solution. 
   I think that is an irresponsible reaction. 
   I quoted to the members of the committee a column that was written in the New York Times yesterday by Thomas L. Friedman. He is the foreign affairs commentator for the New York Times, not normally known--either Mr. Friedman or his newspaper--for their support of Republicans or for their disapproval of Democrats. 
   I found it a rather interesting column. I quoted some of this to my fellow committee members. I would like to quote from it here on the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, Mr. Friedman is writing this column from Tokyo. It has a Tokyo byline on it. He starts out by saying:  
   It's interesting watching the American oil crisis/debate from here in Tokyo. The Japanese are cool as cucumbers today--no oil protests, no gas lines, no politicians making crazy promises. That's because Japan has been preparing for this day since the 1973 oil crisis by steadily introducing natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed mass transit and conservation, and thereby steadily reducing its dependence on foreign oil.  
   That is one of the key paragraphs in this entire piece, that for nearly 30 years now the Japanese have been steadily reducing their dependence on foreign oil. In the same period in the United States, we have been steadily increasing our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Look at the power sources Mr. Friedman refers to: Natural gas, nuclear power, high-speed transit, on the conservation side. I have been a supporter of high-speed transit ever since I came to the Senate. There are some people who have said: Senator, you come from the West. Why do you care about Amtrak? Why do you care about high-speed ground transportation in the Northeast corridor? I have said I care about it because it is part of the long-term solutions in the United States. Even as a Senator from Utah, I have sided with the Senators from New Jersey, the Senators from New York, and the Senators from Delaware in supporting Amtrak and high-speed ground transportation, in hoping to keep that form of transportation alive so we are not always on the highways. 
   Natural gas: There is an enormous amount of natural gas in the United States. 
   Nuclear power: We have not built a nuclear powerplant in this country since the oil crisis of 1973. There are those who say nuclear power cannot be built. I am a strong supporter of nuclear power. 
   Just because we have large supplies of natural gas, including large supplies of natural gas on Federal lands, public lands, doesn't mean we can use the natural gas to heat our homes. Why? Because natural gas on Federal lands is of no value. It must be explored for, it must be brought out of the ground, and then it must be transported, which means building pipelines, usually across Federal lands. 
   Once we realize, particularly in this administration, what the attitude has been, we begin to understand why Mr.  Friedman can write this somewhat sarcastic column in Tokyo. This administration, for 8 years, has done everything it can to prevent the building of additional pipelines across Federal lands. They say, no, we don't want to do that; somehow it will despoil the Federal land if there is a pipeline under it. I stress ``under it'' because once a pipeline is in place, people who are out on that Federal land who love the wide open spaces will not be aware of the fact that the pipeline is there. The pipelines get buried, particularly natural gas pipelines, and the scenery is unaffected. It comes back quickly, in the age of the wide open spaces of the West, a few years, to recover from where a pipeline has been buried. It is nothing more than the blink of an eye in nature's time. This administration is opposed to pipelines. 
   Friedman goes on to tell us that America has failed to do the kind of exploration and conservation that the Japanese have done. He makes this comment:  
   Imagine if America had that sort of steely focus. Imagine, in fact, if at this time of soaring oil prices and endangered environments, America had a presidential candidate who could offer a realistic plan for how to preserve our earth in the balance.  
   Then Thomas Friedman goes on to make this comment, writing in the New York Times:  
   Wait a minute--that was supposed to be Al Gore, but in the heat of the campaign, Mr. Gore has shamelessly offered us instead a fly-by-night plan for putting America out of balance. The new Gore energy theory is to demonize the oil companies, tap into the Nation's strategic oil reserve--which only a few months ago he declared shouldn't be touched to manipulate prices --and talk about developing new magic energy-saving technologies that will create jobs in the swing states where Mr. Gore needs to get elected and will allow Americans to keep driving gas-guzzling big cars and indulging their same energy-consuming habits without pain.  
   I felt a little sense of satisfaction when I read that particular paragraph because I have just traded in my gas-guzzling car for one that will get 70 miles to the gallon on the highway. I am sorry to say that it is Japanese in its origin, but it is a lovely little car and I will be happy to give any Member of this body a ride in it at any point. 
   Back to the Friedman article, referring, again, to the Gore policy with respect to energy:  
   How nice! How easy! And how far from what's really required to free us from the grip of OPEC.  
   He goes on and describes what needs to be done and then makes this comment:  
   Mr. Gore knows this, but instead of laying it on the line he opted for an Olympic-quality, full-bodied pander--offering a quick-fix to garner votes and pain-free solutions for the future. Prime the pumps, pumps the polls and pay later. Don't get me wrong, tapping the strategic reserve makes some sense to ease the current distribution crisis--but doing it without also offering a real program for consuming less oil and finding more makes no sense at all.  
   I go back to the accusation made in this morning's committee hearing: you who are complaining about what the President is doing, have no solution yourselves, so stop complaining. 
   What Mr. Friedman is talking about illustrates what I and other Members of this body have been proposing as a solution for 8 years. For 8 years, we have been trying to increase the domestic supply of power. For 8 years, we have been on this floor asking this administration to allow us to drill more, to find more, to produce more so that we will have the supply when the demand comes. For 8 years, we have been sounding the alarm on the energy issue and we have been ignored by the President of the United States, or on those occasions where we have actually passed legislation, it has been vetoed by the President of the United States on the recommendation of the Vice President: No, we do not need to go after that vast pool of oil that is there in Alaska; It will despoil the environment. 
   The Senator from Alaska has pointed out if we compared this room to the Alaska Natural Wildlife Reserve or ANWR, say this room is the size of ANWR, the footprint of the drilling would be about the size of one of those decorative stars in the middle of the carpet. One could cover it entirely with a single piece of paper 8 1/2 by 11. That would be the total amount of impact on the entire room in the bill that this Congress has passed and that the President has vetoed--not once but twice. 
   Yet now when we say wait a minute, it is the action of this administration that has prevented America from having the oil supplies we need to deal with this crisis, we are told: you have no solution. We have had a solution and we have had it for years and it is the President and the Vice President who have stymied us. 
   I don't want to overdramatize this, but I will try to be a student of history. I feel a little like Winston Churchill who for years and years and years warned of the coming threat, and then when it happened, he had to say to his people: I have nothing to offer you 
   but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. 
   That is overdramatic, and I do not want to overplay it. The point is, there is one thing to be complaining about this over and over and then there is another thing to come along and say: We are in a mess and you guys don't have any solution. 
   My senior colleague from Utah is here. I understand he has reserved the last 10 minutes before the vote so I shall terminate my comments. 
   I want to make it clear, the solution to the problem of high oil prices does not lie in short-term fixes. It does not lie in the kind of neat conclusions that Thomas Friedman talks about. It lies in long-term plans and long-term policies. That being the case, we are not going to get out of this anytime soon. 
   I leave you with this one conclusion that came out of the witnesses. They said this: If everything goes the very best that it can, if everything works according to our plans, home heating oil prices in New England this year will be substantially higher than they were last year. That is the best-case scenario. 
   I think those who should have seen the handwriting on the wall last year bear the responsibility for that situation and should not be let off the hook by just saying to us: Well, what's your solution? 
   We were not in charge. Those who were should bear the responsibility. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Florida, I want to respond briefly to the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts and then perhaps respond to the Senator from Florida. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts has touched a number of issues in this debate. I am not sure I can keep up with him in terms of the volume of subjects he has brought before us, but I will try to respond to some that I think need response. 
   I will start with the H-1B issue, which is the issue with which he started. He told us at great length how much he supports the H-1B program and described the high-tech activity in Massachusetts, his home State, which is dependent on our doing something about the H-1B problem. He did not tell us that he was one of two Senators--and there were only two--in the committee who voted against reporting out the H-1B visa bill about which we are talking. So it is clear his support is conditional on a number of things. 
   He outlined those on the floor. And he is certainly entitled to his conditions and to his attitude with respect to them. But I will point out a few things with respect to H-1B which those Senators who are primarily responsible to the AFL-CIO, in their political lives, do not seem to talk about. 
   We talk about jobs. The Senator from Massachusetts said: Many of the jobs for H-1B visas are filled by people who do not require very high academic standards, so those can be filled by Americans. We should only have the H-1B visas for people with master's degrees and doctorates. He talked about a screening program that would be set up by the Federal Government to determine, on the basis of academic credentials, who could get in and who could not get in on the H-1B system. 
   I spent a good portion of my life in the private sector. I found that experience to be tremendously valuable to me when I came to the Senate. At one point in my young life, I fantasized about the possibility of coming here as a very young Senator, taking a seat maybe in my thirties or even forties. Now I am very glad that I did not do that because that would have meant I would have spent all of that time in the governmental orbit and not learning some very fundamental lessons in the private community. 
   The first lesson I learned in the private community--and learned it again and again and again whenever the situation came up--was that the marketplace rules. I have said here before that if I could control what we carve in marble around here, along with the Latin phrases, which are inspiring and wonderful and historic, I would carve another slightly more practical phrase in marble, to keep it before us so we never forget it, and it would be: ``You cannot repeal the law of supply and demand.'' We try that every once in a while. We try to repeal the law of supply and demand with congressional mandates. This is what, frankly, the Senator from Massachusetts would be up to if he had his way on the H-1B visa issue. 
   Why is there an H-1B visa issue? Because there is a gap between supply and demand. It is as simple as that. There is an enormous demand for certain kinds of jobs in this country. Currently it is running somewhere between 350,000 and 400,000. That is the demand. For whatever reason, the American educational system cannot supply the workers to fill that demand. There is a pool of skilled workers who can fill that demand worldwide, and that pool of supply will meet that level of demand. The only question is: Where? 
   We held a high-tech summit in the Joint Economic Committee, of which the senior Senator from Massachusetts is a member. He came to that summit and heard the executives of the high-tech companies speak to us. I am not sure whether he was there when one particular statement was made, but it made a strong impression on my memory, and I would remind the Senator from Massachusetts, and others, of what one particular man said. 
   He said: ``Senators, understand, this work''--he was referring to the demand--``will be done by these people''--referring to the supply. ``The only question is, whether they will do it living in the United States or living abroad.'' 
   In today's high-tech world, in today's world of the Internet, the job can be sent electronically to the worker living in India, or Pakistan, or some other country; and the results of the work can be sent electronically back to the corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley, or Route 128 in Massachusetts, or Utah Valley, or Salt Lake Valley, or the Dulles Corridor, or any other high-tech center you might want to identify. 
   I cannot understand why it is not recognized in this Chamber almost universally that it would be better for the United States to have highly skilled, highly motivated, immediately qualified individuals living in the United States, paying taxes in the United States, adding to the economic activity of the United States, while they do this work, instead of having them live abroad and paying 
   their taxes and making their contributions to the economy of other countries. 
   Yet the restrictions that would be put on H-1B visas, primarily at the behest of the AFL-CIO, would have the effect of saying, you can't do this work in the United States. And to have the Government screen those who can get H-1B visas on the basis of the Government's criteria of what constitutes the appropriate educational level, is to deny clearly the impact of the market. 
   No one is going to hire someone on the basis of anything other than that person's ability to do the work. I do not want to say to Hewlett-Packard or Intel or Novell, or any other high-tech  company you can name: You can't hire this worker because we in the Government have decided that he does not have the appropriate educational credentials. 
   I want Hewlett-Packard to make that decision. They might not make it right. But it is the shareholders of Hewlett-Packard who pay the price if they make a mistake. That is the way the entire American economy has been built from the very beginning, and that is the way it will flourish in the future. 
   But no, we have from the Senator from Massachusetts an outline of the restrictions that the Government should put on the hiring practices of American companies. And we have from the Senator the statement that the Government should decide who is qualified to come in under an H-1B visa to fill one of these high-tech jobs. 
   Whenever the Government gets involved in trying to change the law of supply and demand, you get one of two things--I said this yesterday when we were in the debate on the minimum wage; I repeat it today--whenever the Government interferes with the law of supply and demand, you either get a shortage or you get a surplus. 
   Let me expand on that a little. As I reread my remarks from yesterday, I was not as clear as I usually like to be. 
   Right now, we have an example of the Government dictating how many foreign nationals can come in to work in the high-tech industry. They set the amount below that for which there is demand. What is the result? A shortage. Interfering with the law of supply and demand, the Government says, we will only allow this many, when, in fact, the requirement is for that many; and the result is we have a shortage of these workers. 
   A flip side of this, where surpluses are created, is where the Government sets a price higher than the market would. If I can go back historically to a time that is impressive to the Western U.S., the Government said: We will buy silver at a set price for our coinage. They set the price of silver higher than the market price. What happened? Everybody went out to find any kind of silver in their mountains, or any sort of mining operation, and the Government acquired a huge surplus of silver. The price was set higher than the market would set and it created a surplus. 
   In the case of skilled workers, the quantity is set lower than market demands, and we get a shortage. 
   So once again, engraved in marble on the walls: ``You cannot repeal the law of supply and demand''--and recognize that every time you try, all you do is create either an artificial surplus or an artificial shortage. 
   As I said, with respect to H-1B visas, the work will get done either in the United States or abroad; and it will get done by the same people either in the United States or abroad. The only question we have to ask ourselves is, Do we want the people who are doing this work, getting paid by American corporations, drawing salaries with which they support their families, to be living in the United States and spending those salaries in the United States, contributing to the tax base of the United States, adding to the economic benefits of the United States, or do we want them living abroad? 
   Obviously, the American companies that seek to hire these individuals want them here because it is more efficient for them to be here. It would mean higher costs for them if they had to do the work abroad, but they will absorb those higher costs because they have to do the work. If they don't, America will lose its technological lead. America will lose its edge over the rest of the world, and we will see the technology world begin to disappear. 
   We have recaptured it. There was a period of time when people said the future lies in Japan, that America's great day of technological advance is behind us, that the Japanese have taken over. I remember those debates. I remember those speeches. It is not true. There is no country in the world that is close to the United States in our technological edge. 
   But to maintain that technological edge, not rest on our oars and coast into the future, we have to have a skilled workforce that can keep things moving forward. It is not available in this country. We have to let those companies hire on a worldwide basis so that the edge can be maintained here. 
   People say, well, they are taking jobs from Americans. Again, Mr. President, the statistics are clear. There are 350,000 to 400,000 high-tech jobs going begging right now because there are not people qualified to fill them. Companies are paying bounties to their employees who bring in a potential employee. In many companies in Silicon Valley, an existing employee will be paid thousands of dollars if he can introduce another prospective employee to his company who gets hired. Bounties are being paid to find people with these skills so that the companies can maintain their technological skills. 
   It is not a matter of saying, well, there are Americans who will be shut out if the H-1B visa program passes. It is not a matter of saying there are American graduates from American universities who will be denied jobs if we let these other people in. No. It is a matter of jobs going begging, jobs that have to be performed if this country is to maintain its technological edge, people who are capable of filling those jobs being allowed to come into this country and perform them. 
   Now there is one other aspect to this that I will highlight and discuss. That is the importance of maintaining America's edge. I have referred to it already, but I want to expand on it a little bit. 
   It used to be that in the industrial age, when a company was established and momentum was created in the marketplace, you could expect the momentum of that company to carry it forward not only for years but probably for decades. In today's world, a technology company can disappear virtually overnight if somebody else gets the edge on them and produces something better quickly. The most important factor in today's economy is speed, the speed with which you get your product to market, the speed with which you move ahead of your competitor. That means, once again, qualified people. That means, once again, being able to fill those particular assignments. 
   Now the Senator from Massachusetts says, well, what we really need to do is spend money increasing training. We look at the bills that are before the Appropriations Committee, and there is an enormous amount of money being spent to increase training in the United States to try to close this educational gap. I would be more than thrilled if we could say that there were already 400,000 American graduates from American universities ready to fill these jobs, that we don't need any visas for high-tech people abroad. 
   One of the ironies of that, however, that applies to the H-1B visa issue, is this: a large percentage--indeed, in some universities it is close to 50 percent--of the high-tech graduates of these universities are foreign born. They hold foreign passports. We give them visas to come to this country to gain the best education that is available anywhere in the world in these high-tech skills. Then when they graduate, we say to them: 
   Thank you very much; you cannot stay because we can't give you an H-1B visa. 
   The American taxpayers--in the State of Utah, it is my State taxpayers--are subsidizing those universities. Why? Because we want the product that comes out of them in the form of qualified graduates. So we have ourselves in the interesting and ironic situation of saying, because we believe in education, we will appropriate money for higher education on both a Federal and State level; because we believe in education, we will do everything to make the American university system the very best in the world, which it is; and because we believe in opportunity, we will allow students from all over the world to come to these schools. 
   But when they have been here and partaken of that tax subsidy and have obtained that education, we say to them: Now you can't work here. You have lived here for 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, with a graduate degree, maybe you have been here 7 or 8 years. You have become assimilated into American culture. You have become comfortable with hamburgers and pizza (which is more of an American food than it is Italian food, I have discovered). You feel comfortable in all of this. You are ready to find a job. You can't find a job in the hotbed of technological advancement, which is the United States of America. You have to go home. We won't give you an H-1B  visa after we have subsidized your education at taxpayer expense. 
   I have a hard time understanding how that makes any sense, that these students from our best universities, who have received the taxpayer subsidy giving them the best degrees, then have to leave because of the artificial barriers created by the attempt, once again, of Government to try to repeal the law of supply and demand. 
   When we talk about Americans filling these jobs, talk about graduates of American universities filling these jobs, let us understand that many of those graduates are themselves the very people who will benefit from the H-1B visa program that is included in this bill. 
   Now a few other comments, and then I will yield the floor. 
   I was interested to hear the Senator from Massachusetts talk about the fact that there are jobs going begging in this good economy and how difficult it is for employers to fill jobs. He was speaking at this time not about the H-1B visa and the high-tech kind of jobs, he was speaking about very ordinary jobs. He was speaking on behalf, he said, of immigrants who he wanted to come in to fill these jobs. He said these jobs are going begging and we need to pass his particular bill in order to make it possible for these immigrants to take these jobs. 
   I am not a member of the appropriate committee, so I cannot comment in detail on the bill he was pressing, but I would like to go back to our debate of yesterday when the senior Senator from Massachusetts was demanding that we raise the minimum wage. We have raised the minimum wage. We do that periodically. But he is demanding that we raise the minimum wage again. 
   To me, there is an interesting gap between the rhetoric of yesterday that says these people cannot support themselves on their wage and the Government must interfere, once again, with market forces that set their wages, to push those wages up, and then the rhetoric of today that says there are a bunch of low-level jobs going unfilled. 
   If the jobs are going unfilled, why is it? It is, once again, because there are not people qualified to take them. I told the Senate yesterday about the experience I have in my home State. When I talk to employers, they say their biggest problem is finding workers. They can't get anybody to fill the jobs. 
   I ask them: Do you offer more than the minimum wage? 
   The answer is always: Yes, we are offering more than the minimum wage. 
   The problem is not that the Government hasn't mandated a high enough wage in order for these people who are just subsisting at minimum wage to get by; the problem is they do not have the skills that will allow them to return enough value to the employer so they can command the jobs that are open in this economy. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts answered his rhetoric of yesterday with his rhetoric of today. I hope he can connect the two so that we can realize that the challenge for people who are living at poverty's edge, the working poor who are getting by on just the minimum wage, is not Government intervention to artificially demand that they be paid more and, thereby, in some cases, run the risk of being priced out of the market for the skills they have. The challenge is to see that their skills are improved. That is where training money should go. That is where many American corporations are spending their training money, and that is where the educational challenge becomes most obvious. 
   American corporations are spending billions of dollars to teach employees how to read and write. That is correct--billions of dollars to teach basic skills that should have been learned in public schools and were not. 
   Now we get to the next issue that the Senator from Massachusetts talked about in his presentation, which is education. I was lured back into public life by the issue of education. I was very happy being the CEO of a comfortable and profitable company. 
   I got a phone call one day saying: Would you be willing to serve as a member of the strategic planning commission for the Utah State Board of Education and address our education issue? 
   I said: Yes, that sounds like a proper kind of citizen thing to do. 
   Then I got a phone call a few days later and they said: By the way, we want you to be the chairman of that commission. 
   Thus, I found myself dragged in a little further and a little deeper than I had originally planned. 
   I immersed myself in education issues and came out of that experience absolutely convinced of several things: 
   No. 1, education is our No. 1 survival issue. Now that the Soviet Union is no more, nothing threatens the future of America, long term, so much as the educational challenge that we face. I am sure that the Senator from Massachusetts would agree with me on that. 
   No. 2, nothing is more high bound and determined not to change than the educational institution in this country. And we have seen that in the debate on this floor. We have seen that in the educational initiatives that have been offered on this floor. The Republicans have brought forth proposal after proposal after proposal that would bring fresh air, new opportunities, new experimentation into the educational establishment. Some of them passed, some of them were filibustered. Those that were passed were vetoed. And always we were told the solution to education is to put more money into the present system. 
   Now, there is a cliche that we have in the business world that says, ``If you want to keep getting the result you are getting, keep doing what you are doing.'' If we want to continue the educational crisis and challenge that we have in this country, then we should keep funding education as we are funding it. But when the Senator from Washington proposes allowing 10 States to experiment--if they want to--with a greater degree of local control over Federal dollars, we are told: No, that threatens public education as we 
   know it. We can't do that. That is risky, that is dangerous. 
   We keep reminding our friends on the other side that if the State doesn't want to do that, they don't have to. We are not mandating this kind of change. We are just making it an opportunity. No, they filibuster against that. They say the President will veto that. They say we can't consider that. 
   I am not one of those who thinks that a voucher program constitutes a silver bullet that is going to solve every educational problem. I know some on my side of the aisle do believe that. I don't; I think there are serious problems with vouchers. But I am willing to experiment with them to find out whether or not in certain circumstances vouchers can help. I am willing to try and get a little data. The data we have with respect to vouchers is quite encouraging--sufficiently encouraging that Robert Reich, a former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton administration, a man not known for his right-wing proclivities, wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal that said that the data is in and vouchers work. I was stunned when I read that. I thought, gee, the experiment is over and we know that it works. He had a most interesting, most creative kind of further proposal to test the implication of vouchers. 
   But, once again, we heard again and again: No, no, we can't experiment with that. It will threaten public education as we know it. And here are their key words, which test very well in a poll, and they work very well in a focus group: If you try the Republican experiment in education, you will drain money away from the public schools. 
   There is an answer to Robert Reich in the Wall Street Journal recently, where Governor Hunt says: No, no, no; you can't do this because what you are doing is taking money away from the public schools. 
   Well, Mr. President, as I say, I spent most of my life in the private sector. I think I understand money and the movement of money. This is the way I understand it. Let me walk through it and see if someone can help me realize how it takes money away from public schools to run one of these experiments. 
   Let's say that a school district is spending $7,000 per year on a child. There are many public school districts in this country that spend more than that. We happen to spend less than that in Utah for a variety of reasons. We spend considerably more than that here in the District of Columbia. 
   Let's take that as a number, for the sake of this illustration. The school district is spending $7,000 per child.  Along comes a Republican opportunity to try something with that child, and we follow the Robert Reich formula that says this is only with low-income children. We will not subsidize a Member of Congress who wants to send his children to private schools, as many Members of Congress have done--as the Vice President has done. No, we won't subsidize them. We will say that only low-income people who otherwise could not even conceive of going anyplace else will be eligible for this program. That is Robert Reich's proposal. OK. Let's take $5,000 and say to this child: You can take $5,000 and go someplace else. 
   As I say, in the private world where I have spent most of my time, $5,000 subtracted from $7,000 leaves $2,000. It seems to me that if you do that, you are saying to that school district you have an extra $2,000 per child for every child to whom you give a voucher, and you can use that $2,000 per child to spend on the children who stay. You can increase spending per child in the public school system if you adopt a voucher program such as the one Robert Reich has endorsed. 
   I do not ever hear that when we hear the rhetoric about education. You are taking money away from the public school system. In the aggregate, yes; you probably are. But we don't teach in the aggregate. We fund and we teach per child. If you are going to make your calculation on the basis of the amount of money available per child, you want as many children on vouchers as you can possibly get because you are going to make an extra $2,000 for every two grand on every one of them. That extra $2,000 is available for the kids who stay in the public system. 
   I would be very interested to have anyone on either side of the aisle explain to me why that math doesn't work. Explain to me why the reality of those numbers doesn't add up because they always add up every time I do the calculation. Every time I run through the examples, it always ends up being more money per student less in public education if you try one of these experiments. 
   I repeat again that I do not believe that vouchers represent a silver bullet. I have spent enough time examining them that I think there are some serious problems with them. I think it needs to be checked and rechecked. We need to be very careful before we endorse any kind of massive movement towards vouchers as some of my fellow Republicans have done. 
   But I ask those who do not even want to experiment: What are you afraid of finding? Are you afraid of finding that it might work? I am not afraid of finding that it fails. I am willing to admit that it was wrong, once we have some actual data. As I say, Robert Reich decided the data demonstrates that it works. The city of Milwaukee has been doing it longer than anyone else. They endorsed it and say it is working there. The driving force behind it was an inner-city black single mother named Polly Williams who serves as a liberal member of the Democratic State legislature. She says: The private system is failing my child. It is failing our children. 
   Interestingly, when you do the polls, support for this kind of experimentation is perhaps highest in the minority community--not the white, middle-class soccer moms in the school districts where the schools do a pretty good job, but in the inner-city minority schools where the children are being left behind, 
   Ultimately, this is the solution to the H-1B visa problem. It is fixing American education so that we have enough Americans to fill those 400,000 high-tech jobs. But it will not be done in the way that the Senator from Massachusetts wants to do it. 
   I repeat: If you want to keep getting the results you are getting, keep doing what you are doing. That is basically what he has offered us--keep putting more and more money into the present system, and don't even think about experimenting with it. When the Republicans say, let's try giving more control to the local school board, we are told, No. That would threaten the present system. When the Republicans say, let's experiment in the District of Columbia with some vouchers and see what happens, we are told, No. That would threaten the present system. 
   I believe we are trying to act responsibly with respect to the education situation. I am afraid there are some others who are trying to act politically and respond to the teachers union and other parts of the educational establishment for whom the only thing better than things the way they are is things the way they were. They don't want to try anything different. They don't want to experiment in the way the late Senator from Georgia tried--it 
   was vetoed; the way the Senator from Washington tried, it was vetoed; the way Robert Reich suggested we try, and it was filibustered. 
   I think we should say to the Senator from Massachusetts: What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of in terms of experimentation? Don't filibuster; don't tell the President to veto. Let us have some of this experience, and then we will see if we can't move in the direction which will give us the graduates from American universities who will fill the 400,000 high-tech jobs. 
   One final comment: The Senator from Massachusetts talked at great length about problems with the INS and the problems with aliens here on an undocumented status who would like citizenship--that we must pass a law in order to solve their problems. Again, I am not a member of the committee, and I don't know the details of the law. I might very well end up in favor of it. But I would say this to the Senator from Massachusetts: If he makes a phone call to the White House, the chances are it will be returned more rapidly than if I do. 
   I will share with him my experience as a Senator, which I think is not atypical. We spend more time in our offices in Utah dealing with INS problems than any other single issue. More people come in with heartrending stories about their difficulty in dealing with the INS. 
   I have ridden along with the Salt Lake Police Department. They told me their No. 1 problem has to do with the INS and the way the INS handles undocumented aliens. 
   In the city of Salt Lake, 80 percent of our drug arrests and 50 percent of our murders are committed by undocumented aliens. They come across the border, go past the border States, and come into Utah where they think they are free from INS supervision because INS is located most heavily in the border States. And they have set up the drug turf wars. They control the drug traffic. They fight to protect their turf. The police tell me that 50 percent of the murders come from that. 
   Interestingly, once the cocaine is gone--they bring it with them--they will go back for more, and then come back again with another stash. Interestingly, the chief of police told me that for some reason there was a shortage of cocaine south of the border and that month all they had in Salt Lake was heroin. They brought a different drug with them, and they stayed until that shipment was gone. Then they went back and another group came--80 percent of the drug crimes; 50 percent of the murders. 
   Naturally, I spend time with the INS trying to get their assistance to deal with this. My point is this: If the Senator from Massachusetts is concerned about INS problems, he is not alone. But the problems, it appears to me, lie with the administration of the INS in this administration rather than with the underlying legislation that deals with it. 
   I was stunned to discover that there are people in my State who have been waiting for a green card so long that their 5-year visa opportunity will expire before they get it. And the answer as to why they are waiting so long has nothing to do with their qualifications but with the backlog that has been built up in the way the INS processes applications for green cards. We are not going to solve that problem by passing a visa piece of legislation that the Senator from Massachusetts wants. 
   But I think if he made a phone call to the President, if he made a phone call to the Attorney General, and he started with the same fervor and volume and excitement that he demonstrates from time to time on the Senate floor to berate them about the way the INS is administered and managed, 
   those who need intelligent handling by the INS in my State would start to get some relief. I don't think they will get relief with the passage of this legislation. But I think they can get relief if we can get the attention of the INS, and the managers, the bureaucrats, the  political appointees--call them what you will--in the Clinton administration who have been handling this for the last 8 years. 
   I am one who would vote for increased appropriations for the INS if I were confident the management of that agency were capable of handling it because I recognize the seriousness of the problem. I see day to day, from the people who come into my office, how wrenching it is in terms of their relationship with their families, but this is something the executive branch should get together first and foremost before they come to the legislative branch for the passing of a piece of legislation that makes everybody feel good. 
   That is the best I can do on this short notice to respond to the issues the Senator from Massachusetts has raised. I enjoy the exchanges that seem to come about now as the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from Illinois, and others repeatedly come to the floor to raise these issues. I and other Senators on this side will repeatedly come to the floor to respond. I am grateful to the Senator from Massachusetts for giving me the opportunity. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we are about through with this debate, as demonstrated by the fact that Senators on neither side are coming to the floor. We would be able to vote more rapidly than anticipated except that some Senators have made appointments based on the assumption we would not be voting until 3:30 or 4. However, we have cleared on both sides that we can vote on the adoption of the pending conference report at 3:15 and that paragraph 4 of rule XII be waived. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the adoption of that time and the waiving of that rule.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am here in my capacity as manager of the conference report. We have had very little conversation about the conference report or any of the items contained in the bill, but through this debate, we have had a great deal of conversation about a number of other issues. 
   I suppose in the spirit of that debate, I can be excused if I respond to the comments made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts. The senior Senator from Massachusetts as well as the Senator from Illinois have given us a great number of statistics about the minimum wage, a great deal of information from various studies that have been done about the minimum wage. I remind them of the last time we had a definitive study on the minimum wage that was given to us with great fanfare from the Department of Labor; that further analysis of that study by objective academics indicated that the methodology of the study was false; that the conclusion of the study, which was that the minimum wage did not in fact destroy jobs, was false, and that the minimum wage does in fact have an impact. 
   I don't want to debate studies and arguments and academics. I want to take us, for just a moment, into the real world of employment. We hear over and over that we are in the most prosperous economy that anybody can remember. That is true. That creates a real world situation which has not been addressed in any of the rhetoric we have just heard. 
   The real world situation is this: When the economy is very strong, there is a very strong demand for labor. As a consequence, unemployment goes down. Unemployment is at historic lows at this time of a good economy. And in the real world, where people really seek jobs and employers really seek workers, there is a shortage of workers. 
   I talk to employers in my State and I say: What is your biggest problem? 
   They say: Our biggest problem is finding workers. We post jobs. We do everything we can to try to get people to come in and take these jobs. They come in off the street and if, during the presentation of what the job is like, we say something that they don't particularly like, they turn and walk out. Why? Because they can walk into another employer down the street and have exactly the same kind of presentation. They are in a position where they can pick and choose. 
   I know this doesn't sound like macroeconomics, but this is the reality of the marketplace in which we operate. If I can talk about macroeconomics for a moment, let me quote Alan Greenspan, who appears regularly before the Senate Banking Committee and the Joint Economic Committee, on both of which I have the opportunity to serve. He says to us the one thing he watches with greatest concern in terms of the possibility of this economy overheating and spiraling off into inflation is the shortage of labor. 
   He says the reason he has not raised interest rates more is because our labor is becoming so much more productive that we can have this kind of tremendous demand in the economy, even though the labor force is not expanding as rapidly as one would think it would have to in historic terms. The labor force is expanding in productivity so that it can keep up with the demand for labor in the economy without becoming inflationary. 
   So there are microeconomic considerations and individual considerations, but it always comes down to the same fact in the real world: There is no shortage of jobs. There is no shortage of good-paying jobs. There is no shortage of jobs above the poverty level. The problem is with people who, for whatever reason, cannot take the jobs that are available. The reason is usually training. The reason is usually experience. 
   If I may get personal for a moment, Mr. President, I don't know how many other Members of this body have worked for a minimum wage, but I have. I did it when I was 14. The job, frankly, was something of a gift because I don't think I added very much value to the corporation that I worked for at age 14 at 50 cents an hour. For me, it was a tremendous experience. I look back on the time that I worked at ages 14, 15, 16, and so on, in the summertime, after school, and on weekends, as one of the most important formative experiences of my life. But I think if the Federal Government had come in and said, no, you can't pay BOB BENNETT 50 cents an hour and we are going to order you to pay him 75 cents, my employer, in all probability, would have said: What he does for us is, frankly, not worth 75 cents an hour, and being true to our shareholders and our other employees whose jobs we do not want to jeopardize, we will just let him go. But the minimum wage was low enough that I could work for 50 cents an hour, I could have that kind of experience and, frankly, I could get the kinds of job skills that made it possible for me, a few years later, to command salaries at substantially higher than the minimum wage. 
   When I hear about the minimum wage from people in my State, it is always from employers who are employing--and this is a very pejorative term, but it is true--marginal workers. And they say: Senator, if you raise the minimum wage, I am going to have to let them go. The contribution that they make to my company, or farm, or ranch, whatever it might be, is marginal. I can afford to pay them the minimum wage now and say that I get some return from their labor. If you raise it, I am going to have to say, no, it isn't worth it; I can't afford this. These people then end up unemployed. The problem with these workers is not to have the Government step in and attempt to repeal the law of supply and demand; the problem is to find innovative, new ways to give them the training and skills they require in order to command a higher wage on the basis of their work. 
   We are about to move, I hope, on to a debate on H-1B visas. People will say: What does that have to do with the minimum wage? It is a manifestation of the same basic principle I am talking about here; that is, we cannot, no matter how powerful we think we are as Senators, repeal the law of supply and demand. 
   H-1B visas are used primarily by high-tech employees from other countries who come into this country to take high-tech jobs. What is the demand for those high-tech jobs? Right  now, there are between 350,000 and 400,000 high-tech jobs, paying in the high five figures and into the low six figures, going begging in this country, and the companies that have those jobs 
   are saying: If we can't find Americans, we want people from outside America to come in and fill these jobs. Will you please allow us to give visas to these people? 
   We cannot legislate that those kinds of salaries be paid to someone who is not capable of doing the job. The focus here, in terms of those who are at the lowest ends of our economic ladder, should be finding ways to train them, equip them, and prepare them to command, on the basis of their own skills, the wages they want instead of having the Government just automatically decree that they be paid a wage that may, in fact, be higher than the amount of value that they can add to their employer. 
   The Senator from Illinois displayed a chart that showed the minimum wage going up and employment going up, and then he suggested that one causes the other. I suggest that there is no relationship whatsoever between those two trend lines. There is another trend line that I think has a relationship. What is the area of greatest unemployment in this country? If you break it down with the demographics and the metropolitan areas, you find that the area of greatest unemployment in this country is among young, black teenagers in the inner city, particularly male. That is, statistically, the area of highest unemployment. 
   The unemployment rate among young, teenage, black males in the inner city in the United States is not only in double digits; it is in high double digits. I don't have the figures with me now. I didn't understand that we were going to debate minimum wage on the legislative branch bill. But they are in the 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent area. Those young, black men would benefit enormously by having a job experience. I know that, as I say, from my own experience, when I was paid the minimum wage at age 14. But it was less to add value to the company than to add skills and understanding to myself. 
   If we had the law of supply and demand operating unimpeded by Government instruction, I can imagine--and I think I could find jobs for those young, black teenagers to do in the inner city. They would not be $6-an-hour jobs, but they would be jobs where there could be some value added to the employer and tremendous experience and training value added to the employee. And the Government, over time, would get tremendous benefits out of that because if those young men could be trained in marketable skills and then go out and command jobs at $10 and $12 and $15 an hour based on their skills rather than the Government demanding that they be paid that whether they produce value for it or not, the economy would be better, society would be better, and America as a whole would be better. 
   So as I listen to these debates on the minimum wage, the emotion, the shouting, and the great indignation that is sent forward here, I ask the Senators to step away from the academic studies. Go out among the employers of their own States and ask this direct question: What will happen in your business to the people you hire if the Federal Government intervenes in this situation and starts to dictate the wages that you pay? 
   A comment came out of the oil crisis of the 1970s when President Carter was telling us that the energy crisis was a crisis that was the moral equivalent of war and that we must somehow marshal the entire energies of the Nation to deal with it. Interestingly enough, as the Senator from Alaska points out, ever since we declared that kind of war, American dependence on foreign oil has gone up, not down. That is one of the main reasons we are looking at $2-a-gallon gasoline in the Midwest, as we are seeing the results of 8 years of an administration that has opposed any kind of energy development in the United States. In that period, an economist made this point that I have never forgotten. He said: When the Federal Government interferes with the setting of prices by the forces of supply and demand, you get one of two results. 
   If the Federal Government sets the price higher than the market would set it, you get a shortage. When the Federal Government sets the price lower than the market would set it, you get a surplus. In other words, when the Federal Government says you must pay a wage higher than these people can return value for, you get a shortage of jobs that these people can fill. If the Government should arbitrarily say we will set a price lower than these people can produce, then you get a surplus of people. 
   We don't need shortages and we don't need surpluses. We need jobs. We don't need shortages. We don't need surpluses of energy. To put it back in the same context, we need the energy. 
   The law of supply and demand gives you a price. It is always the right price as supply meets demand. As soon as someone steps in to try to manipulate that law--be that someone a monopolist, or be that someone a Federal legislator--and you get a diversion between the price that the demand would call for and that the supply would provide, you get either a shortage or a surplus. It has been that way since time immemorial, and it will be that way forevermore into the future. 
   We need to learn that lesson and be a little humble towards that process in the Senate as we stand on the floor of the Senate and raise our voices in indignation to say we must do something for these people in the name of fairness, and realize that in the long run we are in all probability hurting far more than we are helping. 
   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BENNETT. I hope that hour will not be necessary. I am prepared to deal with it. I am prepared to stay on the floor during the hours that are allocated to other Members of this body. But I hope we can move this more rapidly than the 6 hours. 
   This is my fourth year as chairman of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee and the second year that I have had the privilege of serving with Senator FEINSTEIN as the ranking member. 
   I want to begin this report by thanking Senator FEINSTEIN for her assistance in working on the conference report in the House. She, as you know, Mr. President, is a former mayor. That experience gives her a unique insight into some of the issues that we face in this subcommittee. So I pay tribute to her and to her staff and to the professional way in which she has handled her responsibilities. 
   In our final session of the conference, the question was raised by Mr. OBEY in the other body as to whether or not there would be additional legislation added to the conference report. I told him at the time that I knew of no such plan or program. I spoke accurately at the time. However, as things often happen around here, changes did occur under the sponsorship of the leadership of both Houses. As a consequence, the conference report is somewhat expanded from that which was negotiated. 
   Division A of H.R. 4516 contains the conference agreement for the legislative branch appropriations for fiscal year 2001, and additional funding for the credit subsidy which supports the FHA multi-family housing insurance programs. Provision B contains the conference agreement for the Treasury-general government appropriations and repeal of the excise tax on 
   telephones. 
   This bill has attracted attention, and the allocation of time that has been set up around this bill is demonstrated by the time under the control of Senators who have nothing to do with the Appropriations Subcommittee on Legislative Branch and who presumably will talk about other issues than those that are directly connected with the legislative branch appropriations. 
   I will limit my comments to the conference agreement on the legislative branch and defer to the other subcommittee chairmen and other Senators who will address the funding that is contained in this bill under their jurisdiction. 
   This conference agreement appropriates $2.53 billion for fiscal year 2001, which is approximately a 1.6-percent increase over the funding for the fiscal year 2000 level, including the supplemental funding. 
   Both Senator FEINSTEIN and I are proud of the fact that we have kept the increase at such a low level, as we have tried to be as responsible as possible in allocating funds for the legislative branch. 
   We spent a great deal of time going over the accounts and the increases that agencies have had over the last 4 years to find where we could best and most fairly cut or hold down expenditures without impacting employees. 
   Our goal was to ensure that funding would be provided for all current legislative branch employees. We have met that goal. No RIFs, or reductions in force, will be required under this agreement. 
   Another priority was to make sure that adequate funding is provided for  maintenance projects, particularly the projects that involve health and safety issues. I have long since learned in my business career that one of the quickest ways to temporarily show an increase on the bottom line is to cut back on maintenance. One of the surest ways to guarantee that you will get into trouble long term is to cut back on maintenance. We have tried to make sure that we didn't make that mistake here in our desire to hold down the total amount that was being spent. 
   We have also spent a great deal of time talking about security. We made sure that the resources were made available to the men and women who protect the Capitol, its visitors, and Members and staff. 
   I think we have accomplished all of our goals within the current funding restraints. The conference agreement on the legislative branch is a good agreement. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Before I yield so that Senator FEINSTEIN can make her comments, I would like to thank the staff for their hard work: Christine Ciccone, who acts as the majority clerk; 
   Chip Yost, my legislative director; Jim English, who represents the Democratic staff director; Edie Stanley with the Appropriations Committee; and Chris Kerig from Senator FEINSTEIN's office, all of whom have performed yeomen service, staying up late nights and coming in the early morning to make sure those who get the spotlight on the television look better than perhaps we really are. I pay them that tribute and extend to them my personal thanks for all the work they have done. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I listened with interest when the Senator from Arizona spoke about the GAO report with respect to the Olympics. I believe the Senator from Arizona has made a significant contribution and is attempting to move the Congress in a direction in which we should go with respect to the Olympic games. I think he has raised appropriate concerns. I can be specific about some of them. I will not attempt to be specific about them all because they are quite lengthy. 
   For example, the $14.8 million for communications infrastructure to which he objects in the Department of the Treasury portion of the conference report before us was inserted there at the request of the Secret Service, which told the Appropriations Committee that was the amount they required. This was not something that was asked for by the Salt Lake organizing committee or the Senator from Utah specifically. It came from the Department of the Treasury. 
   That is true of some of the other items. But rather than getting bogged down in a debate over the appropriateness of this amount or that amount, every one of which has had that debate in one form or another in the process of getting to the conference report, I want to address the issue of the GAO report and the comments that the Senator from Arizona made about it. 
   He said, very accurately, that the Federal role with respect to the Olympic games has increased dramatically from the $75 million that was appropriated in 1984 for the Olympics in Los Angeles to the amount that has now been appropriated and is going to be appropriated for the Olympics in Salt Lake City, showing the step-up from Los Angeles to Atlanta to Salt Lake City. 
   Inasmuch as Washington, DC, has announced its intention to bid on the Olympic games in either 2008 or 2012, I think now is an appropriate time, as the Senator from Arizona has suggested, to talk about the role of the Federal Government with respect to the Olympic games.  
   The GAO report makes this comment with which I am sure the Senator from Arizona would agree and with which I agree. I think it is a very appropriate comment. It says:  
   Despite the lack of a specifically authorized Government-wide role in the Olympic games, the Federal Government has, in effect, become a significant supporter of the Games when hosted in the United States. Accordingly, Congress may want to consider enacting legislation to establish a formal role for the Federal Government and a Government-wide policy regarding Federal funding and support for the Olympic Games when hosted in the United States.  
   I think that is a very sound recommendation on the part of GAO. It resonates with the concerns raised by the Senator from Arizona. 
   I lived in Los Angeles in 1984 and watched the Olympic games from the standpoint of a resident. Let me add a little history to the history that has been referred to on the floor this afternoon. 
   In 1984, as I recall--I could be wrong, but my memory tells me--Los Angeles was the only city bidding for the Olympic games. The games were seen as an economic disaster for any city unfortunate enough to end up as the host. There were examples all over the world of cities that had hosted the Olympic games and ended up with huge deficits which took them years and years to pay off. Nobody wanted the Olympic games. Los Angeles got the Olympic games almost by default. They hired an extraordinary individual named Peter Ueberroth to serve as the manager of that event, and Peter Ueberroth did something that was both very good and, in retrospect, maybe not so good for the Olympic movement. He brought in for the first time on a serious basis big money sponsors. 
   I remember reading in the Los Angeles Times after the Olympic games were over that there was a surplus in the Olympic account of $30 million that would be turned over to the city of Los Angeles. There were further newspaper stories that said: No, the surplus is $60 million. No, we have looked through the books, the surplus is $100 million. I don't remember now what it ended up being. But it was, for the time, a comparatively staggering amount of money. There were jokes made in Los Angeles about the fact that everything was available as the official filled in the blanks. 
   I remember going with my family to watch the women's marathon. It was the only event we attended in the Los Angeles 1984 Olympic games because it was the only one that was free. We couldn't afford to buy the tickets at that time. As the father of six children, I think other people can understand that particular problem. We stood there on the sidelines and watched the Olympic runners come down. We cheered for the Americans. We were excited. Then after it was over, in the spirit of the time, one of the officials of the games turned to us and said, Do you want an official Olympic sponge? They had handed sponges filled with water to the runners as they went by, and the runners cast them off. 
   Everything was an ``official Olympic'' this or that and had a price tag attached to it. I remember Kodak was very concerned because Peter Ueberroth put the official Olympic film up for bid and Kodak said: You can't possibly have an official Olympic film that isn't an American film. Ueberroth said: Make your bid. Fuji Film outbid Kodak. We had over the Olympics in Los Angeles a large green blimp with ``Fuji Film'' on it. Fuji Film was the official Olympic film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. 
   As I say, the number came out to be ultimately something close to $100 million. It transformed the Olympic movement. From that moment forward, everybody wanted to be the host city for the Olympic games. And everybody assumed that if they could somehow get that plum for their city, they would receive a very substantial economic payoff. But once you start down that road psychologically, a number of interesting things happen. And an interesting thing happened to the Olympic movement.

   Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his inquiry. Since I have no prepared remarks, I am responding directly to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona. I can't put an exact timeframe on it. I will try to restrain my enthusiasm for the sound of my own voice and finish in maybe 15 or 20 minutes--something in that timeframe. I will do my best to do it faster. I understand the Senator from Alaska no longer requires any time. So the Senator from Massachusetts could speak right up to the time we go into the session with the former Vice President.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I may go back, the reaction out of Los Angeles caused the leaders of the Olympic movement to also get dollar signs in their eyes, and the Olympics began to expand. The assumption was, if the costs go up at the International Olympic Committee or the costs go up at the U.S. Olympic Committee, no problem; we will just sell a few more sponsorships and be able to pay for it without any difficulty. 
   So one started chasing the other, and the number of sponsorships sold kept going higher and the costs kept going higher. 
   One aspect of the cost going up has been the addition of new sports. Interestingly enough, the number of sports that will participate in the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002 is significantly higher than the number that participated at Lillehammer in, I believe, 1994. In just that short period of time, the cost of putting on the Olympics has been expanded by a significant percentage--I do not have the number currently available--by adding additional sports. The organizers of the Salt Lake Olympic Committee have told me that even though their budget is very close to the budget at Lillehammer, their costs are substantially higher because of the additional sports that have been added. 
   Somewhere along the line, someone lost track of what happens to all of this. Again, the head of the Salt Lake organizing committee, Mit Romney, has told me that the budget he was handed from the U.S. Olympic Committee implied more sponsorships for the winter Olympics than Atlanta had for the summer Olympics in 1996. He has to go out and sell those sponsorships now because the budget has built into the assumption that money will be there. He is still approximately $40 million or $50 million shy of being able to cover his budget even though he has outsold the sponsorships that went into Atlanta. He has more sponsorship money coming from Atlanta for the winter games, which are less popular than the summer games, and he is still money short. 
   That is what has happened as everybody, reacting to what happened in Los Angeles in 1984, has assumed that the Olympics are a pot of gold. They are clearly not a pot of gold. And we are getting to the point where we may be back to the Los Angeles games when no city wanted to host it because they would end up with a major deficit. 
   I said to Mit Romney: Will we have a deficit in Salt Lake? He said: No, we will not have a deficit because, if absolutely necessary, we will cut back to whatever amount of money we have. 
   We don't want to have America host Olympics that seem to be second class by comparison to the rest of the world. But financially we have no choice if we can't close that gap. 
   I believe Mit Romney will be able to close that gap. I believe he will be able to bring it down so that we will have an exact meeting of expenses and revenues. 
   But in this whole picture comes the question that has been raised by the Senator from Arizona: What is the role of the Federal Government? Increasingly, the Federal Government plays an important role in the Olympics because, increasingly, as the Olympics get bigger and bigger, with more and  more nations, more and more athletes, and more and more opportunities for international terrorism, they become a bigger and bigger problem for the Federal Government. 
   I think the whole question raised by the Senator from Arizona and by the GAO report as to the formalization of the Federal role is a very legitimate question. I think the proposal in the GAO report that was endorsed by the Senator from Arizona that there be a formal involvement from OMB and a formal process within the Congress to track these appropriations is a right and proper proposal. We probably should have done it after the Atlanta Olympics when we had the first indication that this was what was going to happen. We didn't. 
   I am perfectly willing to join with the Senator from Arizona to craft a way to do this once the Salt Lake City Olympics are over. If Washington, DC, or some other American city gets the Olympics at some point in the future, this process will be in place. I think it is the responsible thing to do. I applaud the Senator from Arizona in helping move in that direction. 
   I point out, as the GAO report says, with respect to the $2 billion figure used by the Senator from Arizona:  
   According to Federal officials, most of these funds would have been awarded to these cities or States even if they had not hosted the Olympic games although the funds could have been provided later if the games were not held.  
   Let me talk specifically about the two largest items in that $2 billion figure that relate to Salt Lake City: the mass transit in downtown Salt Lake City and the renovation of I-15, the interstate highway that runs through Salt Lake City. Both projects were properly authorized, properly funded, under established congressional procedures with respect to transportation activities. I-15 was 10 years beyond its designed life when renovation construction began. The project was outlined for 9 years under standard construction procedures. 
   The State of Utah, working with the Federal Highway Administration, came up with a method of doing it which is called design/build; that is, you design it while you are building it. Instead of designing it all first and then building it, you do it simultaneously. In the process, they cut the time from 9 years to 4 1/2 . They also cut the cost by close to $1 billion. 
   Yes, it will be done in time for the Olympics. Yes, it will enhance the Olympics. And GAO has included its total in its calculation of the cost of the Olympics. But it had to be done. It was a logical expense of the highway trust fund. It was funded in the normal fashion through the highway trust fund, and because of the pressure the Olympics put on it in terms of time, we now have a pilot project with design/build that is coming in ahead of schedule and under budget. We are saving taxpayers money by virtue of the pressure that the Olympics put on this highway project. 
   There is absolutely no question that the money would have been spent even if the Olympics had not come to Salt Lake City. It may not have been spent as wisely or as prudently as it is 
   being spent if we had not had the pressure of the Olympics. 
   The second issue is the mass transit system in Salt Lake City. The mass transit system in Salt Lake City, again, stood in queue with all of the other mass transit systems that were being reviewed by the Department of Transportation. It was approved in the Clinton administration as an appropriate transit program for a metropolitan area experiencing tremendous growth and congestion. It is interesting to me to note that the current construction of mass transit in Salt Lake City is going forward even though there was no assurance that it would be completed in time for the Olympic games. In other words, the Department of Transportation approved the full funding grant agreement for that spur of the mass transit system with the full knowledge that it might not be available for the Olympics. 
   Now, the contractors who were building it insisted it would be available for the Olympics. It certainly will help the Olympics. But it was not approved as an Olympic project. It was not examined as an Olympics project. It was not evaluated by the Department of Transportation as an Olympics project. Its cost, however, is included in the GAO study as an Olympics project because it occurred in the period where things were being spent in Utah. 
   I make a footnote with respect to I-15, the interstate highway. It is being funded largely by State funds. The Federal dollars only became available after TEA-21 passed in 1998 and the State decided we couldn't wait. Had we not had the Olympics and waited for full Federal participation in this portion of the interstate, the State of Utah would be paying less than it is now. So the State of Utah has put up a substantial sum of money by virtue of this for this infrastructure. We do not complain because we will have the benefit of that infrastructure after the games are over. However, I want to make it clear to any who are keeping score that if you take the $2 billion figure to which the Senator from Arizona referred that is part of the GAO report and break it down, you come up with a much smaller figure for the Federal participation in the Olympics games that has nothing to do with anything else; that is, you have a much smaller figure for Federal expenditures that are solely Olympics expenditures than anything like the $2 billion. 
   Now, back to the earlier point, that we must address the question of the Federal role. Let us look what the Olympics do to any country that gets them in today's world. My wife and I went to Nagano, Japan, to see the Olympics put on in Japan. We read the Japanese newspapers. We didn't come up with a firm figure, but the Japanese newspapers speculated that the total amount that Japan as a country spent in order to put on the Olympics--the lowest figure I read was $13 billion; the highest figure I read was $18 billion, given the kind of accounting sleight of hand that accompanied the Japanese Olympics. I think the higher figure may very well be the accurate one. Even if we take the lower figure, Japan decided they could not put on an Olympics worthy of world attention without making such infrastructure improvements as to spend ultimately $13 billion. I participated in the benefits of that. I rode the bullet train from downtown Tokyo to Nagano where the Olympics were held. They decided they couldn't put on the Olympics without putting in a bullet train. 
   We, in the United States, view the Olympics as basically a sporting event. The rest of the world views the Olympics very differently, and once a city in a country in the rest of the world is awarded the Olympics, the entire national government of that country becomes engaged. We need to think this one through as a nation. If we ever want to hold the Olympic games in the United States again and have the games be presented to the world on anything like the level that the world has come to expect for the Olympics, we are going to have to face the fact that the Federal Government must be involved in a formal kind of way. 
   The GAO comments about this just growing upon us are correct and a formal examination of the American Federal Government participation in the Olympics is overdue. The fact is, now no city in this country can bid for, accept, and put on the Olympic games without significant, maybe even in the view of the Senator from Arizona, massive Federal support. The Clinton administration has recognized that. I have been a long critic of the Clinton administration in a number of areas, but in this area I must say that the Clinton administration has stepped up to the plate and supported absolutely everything that has to be done to see that the Olympics are put on in an appropriate way. 
   I salute the people in the OMB with whom we have worked, the people in the White House staff with whom we have worked in a collaborative way to bring this all together to see that we will have a responsible Olympic games. 
   The Olympic games in Salt Lake City in 2002 are going to be fabulous. We have the best mountains, the best snow, the best facilities. It is going to be a fabulous experience for the entire world, and all Americans are going to be very proud of the job that the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee will do in putting that on. But the Salt Lake organizing committee could not do it without the kind of support that has been provided by all of the Federal agencies who have been called upon in the various appropriations bills that have gone through.  
   As we look to the future and anticipate the possibility that at some point some other American city will either gain the summer games, as Atlanta did, or the winter games, as Salt Lake City did, we should put in place the recommendations of the GAO and recognize right up front that it is a national effort, it is a Federal responsibility, as well as a city responsibility, and perform as every other country in the world performs with respect to this particular opportunity. 
   If we decide as a Congress that we do not want Federal participation in the Olympic games, make that decision clear, then no American city will ever host the Olympic games again because no American city can ever afford the kinds of things that are required. 
   I thank the Senator from Arizona for raising this issue, for bringing us to an understanding of the importance of the recommendations that the GAO has made, and for giving me the opportunity to give these specifics about the $2 billion figure. The Federal Government, in fact, will spend far less than that figure, far less than $1 billion, far less than however many hundreds of millions of dollars. I do not know the number. I do not know anybody who does. I will try to find it out and bring it to the floor at some point. It will be less than any other federal government has spent to bring the Olympics to their host country, but it demonstrates to us that we have to have the kind of planning and coordination for which the Senator from Arizona calls. 
   I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his indulgence. I ask how much time I have remaining.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have had brought to my attention since I finished my extemporaneous remarks some information about the funding of the Olympics that I would like to now share and put into the RECORD. 
   This is a draft statement that was prepared for Mit Romney. I do not want to put these words in his mouth until he has had an opportunity to review it. It has come from his staff. I believe it is accurate. I will share some of this information with you. 
   First, Federal spending for activities directly associated 
   with the games is entirely appropriate when it is within traditional areas of public responsibility. Example: Two-thirds of the costs are for public safety activities, such as providing counterterrorism support. Other areas where the Government is involved include visas, customs, transportation to the public, and weather information infrastructure--all traditional governmental responsibilities. 
   The statement says the Olympic games are essentially a mission of peace entirely consistent with the objectives of our country and recognizing that the Government spends billions of dollars to maintain wartime capability, it is entirely appropriate to invest several hundred million to promote peace. That is an editorial comment. 
   With respect to the funding and the GAO report, there are two types of unrelated spending combined under the term ``Federal funding.'' First is spending actually required to host an Olympic games; and, second, spending on projects the Government would have funded whether or not the Olympics occur. I have already talked at great length about the second aspect--funding that would have been spent regardless of whether or not the Olympics have occurred. 
   Direct Olympics spending; that is, spending that occurs solely because of the Olympics, as accounted in GAO's report, is about $254 million, not the $1.3 billion that was in the headlines. I repeat that: About $254 million is the direct spending, and it goes for the items that are referred to up above--visas, customs, transportation, weather information and, of course, security and counterterrorism, as indicated by the $14.8 million to which the Senator from Arizona referred that was requested by the Secret Service. 
   I add one other comment to this. The Senator from Arizona talked about future appropriations. We are pretty much over the hump with this year's appropriations. We cannot spend money in fiscal 2002 for Olympic games that are going to be held in February of 2002. So the 2001 fiscal year budget, which we are involved in here, is the big-ticket item. 
   Once we are past this budget cycle, there will be some additional funds in the next year, but they will be much smaller than the funds that are included this year. I say to my colleagues, I know of no funds in the 2001 bills that are yet to come before us that have not, in fact, been authorized in the appropriate procedure to which the Senator from Arizona referred. 
   So, Mr. President, I speculated as to what the number was in my extemporaneous remarks. I have now had the number given to me. The actual number of Olympics-only Federal spending is in the neighborhood of $250, $254 million. I make that additional correction to the RECORD.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to call to the attention of my colleagues an article that appeared on September 1 in the Washington Post, written by Charles Munger, who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, on the issue of the Microsoft litigation and the impact that will have in the marketplace. 
   As I have considered this particular issue, as I pointed out to my colleagues, I come to the Senate unburdened with a legal education but with a background in business. Here is a businessman commenting on the implications of this litigation in a way that I think others might find interesting.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue that is of great concern to the people of my State, and, I think beyond the parochial issue, the people of the country as a whole. 
   Private Fuels Storage is in the process of seeking a license to store nuclear waste on the Goshute Indian Reservation in the State of Utah. Their application seeks a 20-year license with the option of extending it for an additional 20 years. This is being described as an ``interim storage'' place for nuclear waste. I have been silent on this issue up until now. But I have decided to take the floor and announce my opposition to this storage for two reasons, which I will outline. One is something that requires further study and might be dealt with, but the second and more powerful reason for my opposition is a permanent policy issue. 
   Let me address the perhaps less important issue first. But it is an important issue that requires consideration; that is, the location of this particular site with respect to the Utah Test and Training Range. 
   One of the things most Americans don't realize is that we require the Air Force to train over land. There are very few training ranges that will allow aircraft to train over land. Much of the training that takes place in the Armed Forces takes place over the water, but it is not the right kind of training experience for pilots to always have to fly over water. 
   The Utah Test and Training Range has a long history of service to our Nation's military. It was there that the pilots trained for the flights over Tokyo in the Second World War. Indeed, it was there that the crew of the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was trained. 
   The proposal for the storage site at the Goshute Indian Reservation is in a location that will affect the flight pattern of Air Force pilots flying over the Utah Test and Training Range. I have flown that pattern myself in a helicopter provided by the military, and I have seen firsthand how close it is to the proposed nuclear waste repository. 
   There are people at the Pentagon who have said the flight path will not be affected; everything is fine. I have learned during the debate over the base realignment and closure activity that sometimes what is said out of the Pentagon is more politically correct than it is substantively correct. I have talked to the pilots at Hill Air Force Base who fly that pattern, and they have told me, free of any handlers from the Pentagon, that they are very nervous about having a nuclear waste repository below military airspace that will require them to maneuver in a way that might cause danger, and could certainly erode the level of the training that they can obtain at the Utah Test and Training Range. 
   I do not think we should move ahead with certifying this particular location until there has been a complete and thorough study of the impact of this proposal on the Utah Test and Training Range and upon the Air Force's ability to test its pilots. 
   That, as I say, is the first reason I rise to oppose this. But it is a reason that is subject to study, analysis, and examination, and may not be a permanent reason. 
   The second reason I rise to oppose this is more important, in my view, than the first one. I want to deal with that at greater length. 
   Let us look at the history of nuclear waste storage in the United States. The United States decided 18 years before a deadline in 1998 that the Department of Energy would, in 1998, take responsibility for the storage of nuclear waste. That means that through a number of administrations--Republican and Democrat--the Department of Energy has had 18 years to get ready to deal with this problem. Current estimates are that the Department of Energy is between 12 and 15 years away from having a permanent solution to 
   this problem. I do not think that is an admirable record--to have had 18 years' notice, miss the deadline, and still be as much as 15 years away from it. 
   The deadline is now 2 years past, and we are no closer to getting an intelligent long-term solution to this problem than we were. Perhaps that is not true. Perhaps we are closer in this sense: That a location has been identified. Up to $8 billion, or maybe even as much as $9 billion, has been spent on preparing that location as a permanent storage site for America's nuclear waste. We are no closer politically to being ready for that. We perhaps are a good bit closer in terms of the site. 
   I am referring, of course, to the proposed waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, on the ground that was originally set aside and used as the Nevada Test Site. Many times people forget that. The Nevada Test Site is where we tested the bombs that were dropped elsewhere, and the bombs went into our nuclear stockpile. So the ground at the Nevada Test Site has already been subjected to nuclear exposure. The seismic studies have been done, and Yucca Mountain has been found to be the most logical place to put this material on a long-term basis. Twice while I have been in the Congress we have voted to move ahead on that, and twice the President has vetoed the bills. 
   Against that background comes this proposal to build an interim storage site in the State of Utah on the reservation of the Goshute Indians adjacent to the Utah Test and Training Range. 
   This is my reason for opposing that so-called interim site: I do not believe that it will be interim. I do not believe that. If we start shipping nuclear material to the Goshute Reservation in Utah, that gives the administration and other politicians the opportunity to continue to delay moving ahead on Yucca Mountain. 
   Now, how much Federal money has been spent preparing the Goshute Indian Reservation to receive this? Virtually none, compared to the between $8 and $9 billion that has been spent on Yucca Mountain. 
   There will be one delay after another if this thing starts in Utah. People will say: We don't need to move ahead on Yucca Mountain; we have a place we can put it in the interim. The interim will become a century, or two centuries, while the Government continues to dither on the issue of Yucca Mountain. 
   I am in favor of nuclear power. I believe it is safe. I believe it is essential to our overall energy policy. I am in favor of the Energy Department's fulfilling the commitment that was made in 1980 that said by 1998 the Department of Energy will have a permanent storage facility. I believe we have identified that facility through sound science, through expenditure of Federal funds, through every kind of research that can be done, and we are ignoring, for whatever political reason, the opportunity to solve this problem at Yucca Mountain while we are talking about an interim solution at the Goshute Reservation. 
   It is simply not a wise public policy to say that since we cannot solve the permanent problem, we will find a backdoor way for a stopgap interim solution. The stopgap interim solution  will become a permanent solution without the plan, without the analysis, and without the expenditures that have already gone into the permanent solution that is available. 
   Therefore, for these two reasons, I announce my opposition to the depository on the Goshute Reservation in Utah. I am sending a letter to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission asking that they extend the time for another 120 days for public comment on their proposal to proceed with this license. I think the first reason that I have cited alone justifies that extension of time because there has not been sufficient analysis of the impact of this proposed facility on the Utah Test and Training Range. I hope in that 120-day period we can get that kind of analysis. 
   The second more serious reason will still remain. I hope in that 120-day period we can begin to approach that, as well. 
   I thank the Senators for their courtesy in allowing me to proceed on this issue. It relates directly to the State of Utah, but I think in terms of the impact on nuclear power as a whole, it is an issue about which the entire Nation should be concerned. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I recall a time very early in my career, not as a Senator but when I was involved here in Washington in support of a particular amendment that was being debated in the House of Representatives. I sat in the gallery in the House and listened to the debate and was somewhat startled when a Member of the House stood up and attacked the amendment as ``the General Motors amendment.'' 
   He went on to thunder against big business in general, and General Motors specifically, and say: This amendment would take care of big business and it would hurt everybody else. 
   After it was over--and I can report gratefully that our side prevailed in that particular debate--one of his colleagues went to this particular Member of the House and said: What are you talking about when you are attacking General Motors on this amendment? 
   And the Member said: Well, when you don't have any substantive arguments, you are always safe in attacking General Motors. 
   That comes to mind because, as we talk about today's energy crisis, and the rising price of energy at the pump, there are those who are attacking big oil. I think they are a little like that former Member of the House. When your arguments don't have any substance, attack big oil and hope that the public will respond. 
   I want to talk today about why gasoline prices are so high and why a nameless political attack on big oil is not the answer. I do expect these attacks to continue. We are in an election year. There is at least one candidate for President who thinks, if he constantly attacks big oil, people will not pay attention to what is really going on. I want people to pay attention to what is really going on and focus on why we have energy problems in the United States. 
   I start with a memo dated June 5 of this year, sent to the Secretary of Energy, through the Deputy Secretary, from Melanie Kenderdine, who is the Acting Director of the Office of Policy in that Department. 
   She says a very startling thing. I must say, when I say startling, I am being sardonic about it. She says that it is due to high consumer demand and low inventories. What a great revelation--high demand and low supply is going to give us high energy prices. Of course it is. 
   I have said many times, and repeat here today, that one of the things I think should be engraved in stone around here for all of us to see every day is the statement: You cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. 
   We keep trying on this floor--we keep trying in the Government--to repeal the law of supply and demand and make prices and costs in the real economy respond to our legislative whims. But they do not. Prices respond to the law of supply and demand. 
   So this internal memo, from the Department of Energy, is interesting in that it says the real problem is that ``high consumer demand and low inventories have caused higher prices for all gasoline types.......'' 
   But then it goes on to say there are other things that have exacerbated the problem, made it worse. These things are, in fact, legislative, or, in this case, regulatory actions taken within the Clinton-Gore administration in response to the constituency that Vice President GORE seeks to cultivate as he pursues his Presidential campaign. 
   It talks about, specifically:  
   ..... an RFG formulation specific to the area that is more difficult to produce .....  
   The ``area'' we are talking about here is the Midwest. We are talking about Chicago. We are talking about the State of Michigan. We are talking about the Midwest, where gasoline prices are currently over $2 a gallon. 
   These are regulatory actions--I will not read them all--that have been taken by the Clinton-Gore administration that have raised the price of gasoline simply by constricting further the supply. If we understand this, that we cannot repeal the law of supply and demand, if we understand that everything that has anything to do with constricting supply is going to drive up prices, we will begin to understand why we have runaway prices. 
   What can we do to increase supply? That is the answer. You don't have to be a Ph.D. to understand that. You don't have to be smart enough to go on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' and name all of the foreign heads of state if you want to understand this. You have to understand the very basic principle. If we are going to bring gasoline prices down, we are going to have to increase supply. 
   As an aside, let me point out that this problem is not limited to gasoline prices alone. Americans are facing higher heating oil prices next winter. Americans are facing higher hot water prices from natural gas. For any source of energy, the price is going up. Why? Because the supply is not sufficient to meet the demand--economics 101. 
   Let us look at the sources of supply in this country and what the Clinton administration--under the prodding of Vice President GORE who is acknowledged to be the leader on this whole subject within the administration--has done to supply. Let's start with oil. What has happened to the supply of oil in the United States? We find that 56 percent of our oil comes from foreign sources now, which is up from 35 percent, the level when we faced the oil crisis in the 1970s. If we are going to decrease this dependence on foreign oil, we ought to increase the amount of supply in the United States. It is very simple. If we have oil in the United States, let's start pumping that oil to increase the supply. 
   What have we done since President Clinton has been in office? Under the prodding of Vice President GORE, when there was an opportunity to increase supply up in Alaska, this administration said, no, we will not allow you to do that. We passed legislation, both Houses of Congress, and sent it to the President, that would have increased supply, had more oil available in the United States. Under the prodding of Vice President GORE, the President said, no, we will not allow you to drill for oil in Alaska, even though there are indications there is as much oil up there as there is in Saudi Arabia, according to some reports. No, we will not allow you to increase that source of supply. 
   There are other sources of supply domestically. What about the Outer Continental Shelf? President Clinton said, no, you can't drill anymore, no more exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf until 2012. Vice President GORE, in his campaign, has pledged to stretch this prohibition perpetually. President Clinton says, we will prohibit you from doing it until 2012. Vice President GORE says that is not good enough; we will prohibit you from going further. 
   So they won't let us look for supply in Alaska. They won't let us look for supply on the Outer Continental Shelf. What about the Federal lands? Is there oil in the Federal lands? No, we won't let you drill. We won't let you explore in the Federal lands, even to find that out. So we are at the mercy of foreign sources of supply. This administration has determined to keep us at the mercy of foreign sources of supply when we are talking about oil. 
   Now let's talk about natural gas. The geologists say the United States has an almost unlimited supply of natural gas. Maybe it is all right for us not to increase the supply of oil, even though that is what is driving up the cost of gasoline at the pump, if we can provide our energy through natural gas. Federal lands in the Rocky Mountain West, where I come from, contain up to 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. But this administration has put those lands off limits for exploration. We cannot even find out how much is there. No, Vice President GORE says, we can't look for natural gas on Federal lands. 
   So what other sources of energy do we have? Well, one of the major sources of energy in my State is hydroelectric power coming from the Glen Canyon Dam. The Sierra Club has said: Let's tear down the Glen Canyon Dam. Let's take it down and eliminate that source of power supply altogether. The administration, to its credit, has said, no, we don't think that is such a good idea. But the Vice President, who has been endorsed by the Sierra Club, says he endorses their agenda, which raises the question, if he were to become President, would he in fact say, let us tear down the Glen Canyon Dam and thereby destroy that source of power? They have already suggested they want to study tearing down the dams on the lower Snake River, which produce hydroelectric power. Now, in this election  season, we have a statement out of the administration and the Vice President that says: We will not take down these dams now. We will not take these dams down in the short term. We will study it. 
   There are those who suggest that means we will wait until after the election, and then we will take down the dams. If, indeed, the dams are taken down, hydroelectric power goes away. Hydroelectric dams generate roughly 10 percent of this Nation's power. 
   So we can't drill for oil, we can't explore for natural gas, and we want to dismantle some of the hydroelectric power. What about nuclear power? That is where most of the power comes from in Europe and in many other countries that don't have the hydroelectric facilities we do. 
   On April 25 of this year, President Clinton vetoed legislation that would have allowed storage at Yucca Mountain of nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is building up at every nuclear facility in the United States. At some point we have to deal with it. The Congress thought it had dealt with it by creating Yucca Mountain. The President said, no, even though we have spent billions and billions of dollars preparing Yucca Mountain to receive this nuclear waste, we won't let it go there, thus jeopardizing the opportunity for this country to have a long-standing, long-going nuclear program. 
   All right. If we are not going to be able to handle nuclear power, if we can't drill for oil and oil power, if we can't explore for natural gas, and if we are trying to cut back on hydroelectric, where are we going to get the power? There are those who say, well, most of the power in this country comes from coal. Coal, of course, has a problem as far as the environment is concerned. 
   I am proud to report that we have in the State of Utah some of the best low-sulfur coal in the world, which, if burned, would have an enormous benefit for the environment. Just 4 years ago, President Clinton, with Vice President GORE clearly identified as the driving force behind the decision, shut down the possibility of ever using any of that coal from Utah when he 
   created the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, using the Antiquities Act in a way it was never anticipated to be used, violating all aspects of consultation as required under NEPA, refusing to even admit to elected officials in the affected State that he was even thinking about it. The President, with a stroke of a pen, said, you can't use any of that low-sulfur, good-burning coal. 
   So you have to go to other kinds of coal. Fifty-five percent of our Nation's electricity is generated by coal, and 88 percent of the electricity in the Midwest comes from coal. 
   But now they are saying we must put controls and restrictions on coal and the activity with respect to coal--to the point we have seen the senior Senator from West Virginia, who represents a number of coal producers, demonstrate his concern with this administration. 
   So what is left, Mr. President? What is left to increase the supply? Well, you can't drill for oil. You can't explore for natural gas. You can't expand hydroelectric power. We hope to get that back. You can't use the coal. What is left? Prayer? I believe in prayer. But I also believe that the Lord prefers those who pray to him to do a little bit about it, to work at it. If I can go back again to the roots of my State, founded by the pioneers who came across the Plains, the story is told about a wagon train that got caught in a river. One of the leaders of the wagon train immediately dropped to his knees. The other fellow who was involved said, ``What are you doing?'' He said, ``I am praying.'' And the second man said, ``I said my prayers this morning. Get up and pull.'' 
   I think if we are going to pray for divine assistance to help us increase the supply for energy in this country, we better get up and pull at the same time and recognize that saying no to the expansion of every single source of energy in this country in the name of appealing to an environmental community, as the Vice President has historically done, puts us in the position where we are going to have high energy prices for as far as the eye can see. 
   I hope as people address the question of why gasoline is over $2 a gallon in the Midwest today--and those high prices are spreading--and as people address the question of why fuel oil will be twice as much in the winter than it has historically 
   been, as people address the question of why the natural gas prices are continuing to go up, they will understand that, once again, we cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. If we want to bring energy prices under control in this country, we ought to help the President and the Vice President understand that truth and say the only solution to high prices, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, is increased supply for the demand that is built into our economy. As soon as they understand that and will work with this Congress to try to get increased supply in the various ways we have sent them legislation to do, we will then--and only then--begin to see these high prices come down.

   Mr. BENNETT. Is the Senator aware the majority leader has an agreement with the minority leader whereby a number of judges would, in fact, be confirmed and that the agreement was accepted by both sides, only to have the minority leader come forward and say that he wanted to identify the specific judges, and the numbers were not acceptable? The minority leader wanted to pick specific people, in contradiction of the normal pattern of the Judiciary Committee. 
   Is the Senator aware of the fact the minority leader has taken that stand?

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will now turn to the subject that has been raised today and yesterday and last week and repeatedly in the last few weeks. That is the subject of why the Senate is not proceeding on the pace and with the vigor we all think it should. We have heard from the Senator from Rhode Island and others today about how the majority leader has somehow dictatorially brought everything to a terrible halt and wouldn't it be wonderful if we went back to the great spirit of cooperation and comity that allows us to get things done. I agree absolutely that it would be wonderful to return to the spirit of cooperation and comity that would allow things to be done, but I think it is pointing the finger in the wrong place to attack the majority leader. 
   Let me share with you my experience this last week. Monday of this week was July 24, which in my home State is the biggest day of the year. July 24 happens to be the day that Brigham Young and the first group of Mormon pioneers entered Salt Lake Valley and put down roots that have now become not only Salt Lake Valley but the State of Utah. Every year we celebrate that historic event with a major parade. It is one of the requirements for a politician to be in that parade. Senator HATCH and I always confer about whether or not we will be able to make the parade because we don't want to miss votes. There have been times when we have had to miss the parade to be here to do our appropriate duty. 
   On Friday of last week, I went to the staff of the leadership and said: What is going to happen on Monday? I was told: We will be on energy and water. There will be amendments and there will be votes. 
   I then went to the subcommittee chairman of the Appropriations Committee and said to him--this being Senator DOMENICI--how important will the votes be and how many will there be?  
   Senator DOMENICI said: Well, there will be several votes, but I think they will be relatively unimportant ones. They will not be close. 
   I said: Well, Senator, I think under those circumstances, I will go to Utah and ride in the July 24 parade. If you can assure me that it will not create an undue hardship for you with respect to passing important amendments that my vote would not be absolutely essential, I think I will go to Utah. 
   He told me: Senator, you can go to Utah. I will see to it that the amendments that we vote on on Monday will not be so close that your vote would have made that much of a difference. 
   So I went to Utah. When I got back, I said to my staff: How many votes did I miss and how important were they? I found out I didn't miss any votes. The Senate didn't vote. Why? The Senate didn't take up the bill. Why? Because the minority objected to the motion to proceed, and the majority leader was required to file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to consider the bill. 
   I have made the statement in this Chamber before that based on my experience, I can remember a time when no one ever objected to a motion to proceed. A filibuster on the issue of the motion to proceed was something that was unheard of from either side. We have been told this afternoon ``couldn't we go back to the time when people got along with each other'' from the same side of the aisle that has said: We will filibuster the 
   motion to proceed. 
   So the majority leader had to file a cloture petition. He filed the cloture petition. We voted on it. When we voted on it, it was passed overwhelmingly, if not unanimously. That raises the question: Why did we go through this exercise? Why couldn't we have been on the bill at the time we were scheduled to be on the bill? Why are we in this situation now when we are under a cloture situation running off 30 hours on the clock so we can then finally get around to voting on the bill, knowing that as soon as we get through with this one, there will be another one where there will be objection to the motion to proceed, the requirement that a cloture petition be filed, and the running off the clock again? 
   There are various ways to defeat legislation. One of them is to delay it. I said once before, I worry this Chamber has started to move from being the world's greatest deliberative body to being the world's greatest campaign forum. I am distressed by reports in the popular press that say that the Vice President and his party intend to run against a do-nothing Congress. We are doing everything we can to make this a do-something Congress, but there are forces at work to try to create the prophecy of a do-nothing Congress into a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
   It can be done in such a way that the public at large doesn't understand what is going on. The public at large doesn't know what cloture means. I go home to my constituents and I try to explain what is going on. They don't understand what the motion to proceed is. They don't understand the rules of the Senate. You talk to them about unanimous consent agreements that are not being agreed to, agreements that are made between the two leaders that then get set aside and cloture petitions, their eyes glaze over when you start talking like that. They come back to you--these are my constituents--and they say: Why aren't you getting your work done? 
   When you have to make these kinds of explanations, the public gets impatient, which plays into the hands of those whose electoral strategy is run against a do-nothing Congress. I have started to use that language, as I explain to my constituents why we are not getting the people's work done. I say to them very deliberately--and it pains me because I do not want to cast clouds over this institution, but I believe I have to say it anyway--there are those who want to run against a do-nothing Congress who are determined to create a do-nothing Congress. And in the Senate, the rules are such that you can do that. The rules are such that even if you are in the minority, if you want to bring this place to its knees and bring it to a halt, you can do that. 
   I have been in the minority. I have heard some of my fellow party members in the minority say: We have to bring this place to a halt; we have to shut it down. I am glad I didn't participate in the attempts on the part of the minority to shut this place down when George Mitchell was the majority leader; when George Mitchell did many of the things that TRENT LOTT is now being accused of doing; when George Mitchell said: We have to do the people's business, even if it means, as majority leader, I exercise something of an iron fist to make sure we do the people's business; I will do it and we will get the people's business done. Those on this side of the aisle who said in my hearing, ``let's shut this place down,'' did not prevail. 
   I did not participate with them, and I am proud of that fact, that we did not attempt to shut this place down. Were we frustrated? Absolutely. Were we upset? Absolutely. Did we engage in filibusters, yes, straight up. My assigned time was from 1 to 2 o'clock in the morning in a filibuster, when George Mitchell said: If the Republicans are going to filibuster us, let's go around the clock. I was very up front about it. I believed the bill that we were talking about was sufficiently bad that I was willing to take my turn from 1 to 2 o'clock in the morning to see to it that the bill didn't pass. 
   That is part of the game around here. That is the way the rules are structured. I have no problem with that. But objecting to the rule to proceed, which is the kind of thing the public doesn't understand, but that all of us understand, is a stealth filibuster. It is an attempt to slip under the public awareness, shut this place down, and create a situation where you can then run against a do-nothing Congress. 
   I remember the first person to run against a do-nothing Congress--Harry Truman. I remember what Harry Truman did. It was very different from what is being done here. Let's get a little history here. 
   Harry Truman was President of the United States by virtue of Franklin Roosevelt's death. He had not run for President, he had not been elected, and he was not very popular in the country. The Republicans controlled both Houses of Congress as a result of Harry Truman's lack of popularity, and they were absolutely sure they were going to win the 1948 election. So they were determined they were not going to pass any legislation that Harry Truman could veto. They were going to wait until Thomas Dewey became President of the United States, and then they were going to pass their legislation for a President who would sign it. 
   They held the Republican National Convention, and in the convention they outlined all of the things they were going to do, once they were in power, in both the Congress and the executive branch. Well, Harry Truman called their bluff. Harry Truman said: If that's what the Republicans really will do when they are in charge, let them do it now. He called the Congress back into session after the Republican convention and said to them: Here is your opportunity. Here is your platform. Pass your platform. 
   Well, Robert Taft, who was the dominant Republican--the man whose picture graces the outer lobby here as one of the five greatest Senators who ever lived--made what I think was a miscalculation. He thought Harry Truman was so unpopular in the country at large that the Congress could thumb its nose at the President of the United States, and he said: We are not going to do anything in this special session that the President has called us into. We are not going to play his game. 
   So the Republican Congress adjourned after that special session without having done anything--deliberately, without having done anything. Harry Truman then went out and ran against the do-nothing 80th Congress and got himself elected in his own right as President of the United States. It was one of the great political moves of this century. 
   That is not what we are dealing with here. We are not dealing with a Republican Party that doesn't want to act. We are not dealing with a Republican Party that doesn't want to solve the people's problems. We are dealing with a Republican Party that is trying desperately to perform the one absolutely required constitutional function that the Congress has, which is to fund the Government. We are trying to pass appropriations bills to fund the Government, so that there will not be a Government shutdown, there will not be a continuing resolution, there will not be a crisis at the end of the fiscal year.  When we try to move to the bills that will fund the Government, we run into procedural roadblocks on the part of those who are then talking about running against a do-nothing Congress. That is what is going on here. 
   If we have to say it again and again and again, so that our 
   constituents finally begin to understand it, I am willing to say it again and again and again. We have discovered that one of the strategies being played out in this great campaign forum is to take an amendment that is seen as a tough political vote, bring it up, see it defeated, and then the next week bring it up again, and then complain when the Republicans say we have already voted on that; we don't need to vote on it again. Oh, yes, you do, says the leadership on the other side; let's vote on it again. 
   If we vote on it again and defeat it, thinking, OK, we have had a debate and we have taken our tough political votes and we have made it clear where we stand on this issue, let's move forward, no, we are told somehow when you want to move forward without bringing up this amendment again: You are thwarting the will of the Senate; you are turning the Senate into another version of the House of Representatives if you won't let us vote on this controversial amendment a third time. 
   If it gets voted on a third time, then it comes up a fourth time. If it gets voted on a fourth time, it comes up a fifth time. Every time the majority leader says: We have done that, we have debated that, we have voted on that, he is told: No, if you take a position that prevents us from voting on it again, you are destroying the sanctity of this institution. 
   Well, now we are being told we are interfering with the President's constitutional right to appoint judges. I find that very interesting because this Congress has confirmed more judges in an election year than previous Congresses. Quoting from my colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and therefore in a position to have the statistics, there are fewer vacancies in the Federal judiciary now than when the Democrats controlled the Congress and the Republicans controlled the White House in an election year. If I may quote from Senator HATCH:  
   Democrats contend that things were much better when they controlled the Senate. Much better for them, perhaps. It was certainly not better for many of the nominees of Presidents Reagan and Bush. At the end of the Bush administration, for example, the vacancy rate stood at nearly 12 percent. By contrast, as the Clinton administration draws to a close, the vacancy rate stands at just 7 percent.  
   Well, turning it around, the vacancy rate we are facing now is roughly half that which a Democratic Senate gave to President Bush as he was facing reelection. Oh, but we are being told: No, there are judges who have languished for a long time; therefore, we should have a vote on the judges whose names have been before us the longest before we have a vote on the judges who may have been nominated more recently, and it is terrible to hold a judge or any nominee for a long period of time. We need to give him or her a vote. We need to bring the names to the floor of the Senate, and the minority leader should decide which name is brought to the floor of the Senate. 
   I remember when I first came to this body, I was assigned to the Banking Committee. There was a nominee sent forward by President Clinton whom the chairman of the Banking Committee didn't like. The chairman of the Banking Committee at the time was, of course, a member of President Clinton's own party. But his objection, as I understood it--and I may be wrong--was that this particular nominee had too much Republican background on his resume, that this particular nominee had not been ideologically pure enough for the chairman of the Banking Committee. 
   As I say, that is my memory, and I could be wrong. But that was the very strong position on the part of the chairman of the Banking Committee. That nominee didn't come up for a hearing before the Banking Committee for the entire 2 years that the Democrats controlled the Banking Committee and that man was the chairman. Any attempt on the part of anybody else to get that particular nomination moving was thwarted by the chairman. 
   Now, what if the then-minority leader, Senator Dole, had come to the floor and said we will not allow anything to go forward until this nominee comes to the floor for a vote? 
   How would people have reacted to that kind of action on the part of the minority leader if the entire minority had gathered around him, and said: We will stand with you, we will filibuster the motion to proceed, and we will do everything we can to bring the Senate to a complete halt until this nominee that has languished in the Banking Committee for almost 2 years is brought forward? I am pretty sure I know what George Mitchell would have told Bob Dole. I am pretty sure I know what the majority leader would have said under those circumstances. It probably would not be as mild as the comments TRENT LOTT is currently making about the present demands that are being made with respect to specific judges by name--not the agreement that the minority leader and the majority leader made where the majority leader said: All right, we will move forward on judges; we will bring a determined number of judges forward--but to say, no, we are now changing, and we are demanding a specific name be brought forward or we will shut the whole place down, and then come to the floor and say somehow the work of the people is not getting done. 
   I am willing to take the tough votes that are being referred to on the floor. I have taken the votes on guns. I have taken the votes on abortion. I have taken the votes on minimum wage. I have taken the votes on Patients' Bill of Rights. I have taken the votes on prescription drugs for seniors. I have a record now that I will have to stand and defend before my constituents. Those votes have been taken because the minority has had the right to bring up every one of those issues and demand a rollcall vote. 
   I don't apologize for the fact that I backed the majority leader in his position that we don't need to take those votes again. While we are in the process of trying to fund the Government and discharge our constitutional responsibility, we don't need to sidetrack that business to go over old ground. If there is an election that has come up so that there are new people here and the electoral balance has shifted, it obviously makes sense to take those votes against. But to have the same people in the same Chamber in the same Congress in the same session repeat the votes again and again and again doesn't make any sense when the process of debating each one of those votes again and again and again delays the whole legislative process to the point that we get to what I sadly have come to the conclusion is the goal here, which is to create a do-nothing Congress so that some people can run against a do-nothing Congress. 
   If it means the majority leader has to get as tough as George Mitchell, if it means the majority leader has to be as firm as his predecessors, who were Democrats who were firm in order to move the people's business, I support the majority leader. It does not disgrace this body. It does not take this body away from its traditions. It is in the tradition of the body to move legislation forward and get the people's business done. 
   I applaud Senator LOTT for his courage and his leadership in moving us in that direction. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, when my constituents ask me, what is the nicest thing about being a Senator, what do you enjoy the most, I have a ready answer: It is the people, the people we get to meet, the opportunities we have to interact with some of the most extraordinary individuals throughout the world. 
   When I say that, my constituents immediately think of the great names: Presidents of the United States, Presidents of other countries, famous Prime Ministers. Schoolchildren look at me and say: Have you ever met President Clinton? They are always a little in awe when I say yes. Then others, when I tell them of having met President Gorbachev, President Mubarak, or Chairman Arafat or some of the other names they read about all the time, say: Well, we can understand why you think that the people you get to meet is the fun part of the job and the most extraordinary benefit that comes from being a Senator. And that is true--meeting these famous people is something of a trip and a great opportunity. 
   I always explain to them that the great privilege is not only meeting the famous names. It is meeting my fellow Senators. This is an extraordinary body, filled with extraordinary individuals, many of whose names never get into the headlines beyond their own States or outside of the circle of the beltway, but who bring to this body an incredible background of wisdom, experience, humor, perspective, balance, and understanding that makes it a great privilege and blessing for the rest of us to be with them.

   Mr. BENNETT. I would like to ask the Chairman a question about the language concerning the 1994 Desert Tortoise Recovery Plan on page 18 of the report accompanying this legislation.

   Mr. BENNETT. As the Chairman knows, I am deeply troubled that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, and other federal agencies have moved very quickly to impose the land use controls recommended in the Recovery Plan, but have failed to undertake the basic tasks called for in that document to determine whether those land use controls are truly appropriate and are proving to be effective. I am speaking of three tasks: the desert tortoise monitoring that the Plan called ``crucial to determining if desert tortoise populations are stationary, declining, or increasing''; the desert tortoise population estimations that the Plan stated would be made every three to five years; and the Plan's reassessment that also was to be conducted every three to five years.

To ensure that appropriated funds are spent wisely, I want to voice my concern that any methodology to be employed in conducting the monitoring be designed to permit correlation of the new data with the data gathered between 1980 and 2000. This will ensure that population trends, and the efficacy of programs and mitigation undertaken since 1980, can be determined.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which will bring to a close the Federal acquisition of an important piece of private property in Washington County, Utah. 
   As some of my colleagues are aware, in March of 1991, the desert tortoise was listed as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. Government and environmental researchers determined that the land immediately north of St. George, Utah, was prime desert tortoise habitat. Consequently, in February 1996, nearly five years after the listing, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] issued Washington County a section 10 permit under the Endangered Species Act, and a habitat conservation plan [HCP] and an implementation agreement were adopted. Under the plan and agreement, the Bureau of Land Management [BLM] assumed an obligation to acquire private lands in the designated habitat area to form the Red Cliffs Reserve for the protection of the desert tortoise. 
   One of the private land owners within the reserve is Environmental Land Technology, Limited [ELT], which had earlier acquired approximately 2,440 acres from the State of Utah for purposes of residential and recreational development. In the years preceding the adoption of the habitat conservation plan, ELT completed appraisals, cost estimates, engineering studies, site plans, surveys, utility layouts, right-of-way negotiations, staked out golf courses, and obtained water rights for the development of this land. Prior to the adoption of the HCP, it was not clear which lands the Federal and local governments would decide to set aside for the desert tortoise, although it was assumed that there was sufficient surrounding Federal lands to provide adequate habitat. However, in 1996, with the creation of the Red Cliffs Reserve, which included land belonging to ELT, all development efforts were halted. 
   With assurances from the Federal Government that the acquisition of the ELT development lands was a high priority, the owner negotiated with, and entered into, an assembled land exchange agreement with the BLM in anticipation of intrastate land exchanges. The private land owner then began a costly process of identifying comparable Federal lands within the State that would be suitable for an exchange for its lands in Washington County. Over the last four years, BLM and the private land owners, including ELT have completed several exchanges, and the Federal Government has acquired, through those exchanges or direct purchases, nearly all of the Private property located within the reserve, except for approximately 1,516 acres of the ELT development land. However, with the creation of the Grand Staircase National Monument in September 1996,  and the subsequent land exchanges between the State of Utah and the Federal Government for the consolidation of Federal lands within the monument, there are no longer sufficient comparable Federal lands within Utah to complete the originally contemplated intrastate exchanges for the remainder of the ELT development land within the reserve. 
   Faced with this problem, and in light of the high priority the Department of the Interior has placed on acquiring these lands, BLM officials recommended that the ELT lands be acquired by direct purchase. During the FY 2000 budget process, BLM proposed that $30 million be set aside to begin acquiring the remaining lands in Washington County. Unfortunately, because this project involves endangered species habitat and the USFWS is responsible for administering activities under the Endangered Species Act, the Office of Management and Budget shifted the $30 million from the BLM budget request to the USFWS's Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund budget request. Ultimately, however, none of those funds were made available for BLM acquisitions within the Federal section of the reserve. Instead, the funds in that account were made available on a matching basis for the use of individual States to acquire wildlife habitat. The result of this bureaucratic fumbling has resulted in extreme financial hardship for ELT. 
   The development lands within the Red Cliffs Reserve are ELT's main asset. The establishment of the Washington County HCP has effectively taken this property from this private land owner and has prevented ELT from developing or otherwise disposing of the property. ELT has had to expend virtually all of its resources to hold the property while awaiting the compensation to which it is legally entitled. ELT has had to sell its remaining assets, and the private land owner has also had to sell assets, including his home, to simply hold the property. It is now impossible for him to hold the property any longer. This situation is made more egregious by the failure of the Department of the Interior to request any acquisition funding for FY 2001, even though this acquisition has been designated a high priority. Over the past several years, ELT has pursued all possible avenues to complete the acquisition of these lands. The private land owner has spent millions of dollars pursuing both intrastate and interstate land exchanges and has worked cooperatively with the Department of the Interior. Unfortunately, all of these efforts have been fruitless thus far. Absent the enactment of this legislation, the land owner faces financial ruin. The failure of the government to timely discharge an acknowledged obligation has forced this private land owner to liquidate his business and personal assets and effectively carry the burden of a large portion of the Red Cliffs Reserve on his back. This is clearly not how the government should treat its citizens. 
   The legislative taking bill that I am introducing today will finally bring this acquisition to a close. In my view, a legislative taking should be an action of last resort. But, if ever a case warranted legislative condemnation, this is it. This bill will transfer all right, title, and interest in the ELT development property within the Red Cliffs Reserve, including an additional 34 acres of landlocked real property owned by ELT which is adjacent to the land within the reserve, to the Federal Government. It provides an initial payment to ELT to pay off existing debts accrued in holding the property, and provides 90 days during which ELT and the Department of the Interior can attempt to reach a negotiated settlement on the remaining value of the property. In the absence of a negotiated amount, the Secretary of the Interior will be required to bring an action in the Federal District Court for the District of Utah to determine a value for the land. Payment for the land, whether negotiated or determined by the court, will be made from the permanent judgment appropriation or any other appropriate account, or, at the option of the land owner, the Secretary of the Interior will credit a surplus property account, established and maintained by the General Services Administration, which the land owner can then use to bid on surplus government property. 
   This legislation is consistent with the high priority the Department of the Interior has repeatedly placed on this land acquisition, and is a necessary final step towards an equitable resolution for this private land owner. The time for pursuing other options has long since expired. I encourage my colleagues to support the timely enactment of this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion about this amendment. My understanding is that the order is for an hour equally divided between the proponents and the opponents of the amendment. I do not believe that time will be necessary. I certainly do not intend to take the time to explain all of the aspects of the amendment because I did so in a previous floor speech several weeks ago. I think, in the interest of moving things along tonight, I should just say to any who are interested in the issue to go back to my earlier floor speech, which was complete with charts and visual aids, and all of the other bells and whistles that we sometimes bring to the floor, and read that, and you will see how I feel about this amendment. 
   The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. THOMPSON, had great concerns about the issue we are discussing. This amendment has to do with export licenses for technical material, most particularly computer material that might be exported in such a way as to allow some foreign power to gain a computer capability that would enhance their military power against the United States. 
   Senator THOMPSON and I have been talking about this for weeks, if maybe not as long as a month or so, in an effort to find some accommodation to the concerns that he very legitimately raises about our national security and at the same time recognizes the reality of the marketplace, which is that these chips, if they are not exported from the United States, will get to the world market from Japan, Germany, Holland, and in one instance China itself. 
   We would like to make sure the international market is as dominated by American chips as we can possibly get it to be, which is why we are trying to shorten all of the time connected with this. Senator THOMPSON, who has his own concerns about it, has been asking that we not shorten the period as drastically as this amendment would do. 
   If I were offering the amendment entirely in a vacuum--that is, a legislative vacuum--I would like the amount shortened from 180 days to 30 days for the congressional action with respect to these items because I think 30 days is long enough. 
   I point out, at the moment, if we are going to export an F-16 to some foreign government, Congress has only 30 days to comment. 
   Some of these computers, to put it in the context of how rapidly things are moving, can be purchased at Toys ``R'' Us right now and be available for some foreign agent, if he wanted to come into the country, to tuck under his arm, walk through customs, go home to his country, and have a computer powerful enough in that toy that could do things that as recently as 3 years ago would seem miraculous. 
   So I have abandoned my 30-day desires because of the very significant legislative situation in which we find ourselves. 
   The 60-day requirement, which is in my amendment, has passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 415-8. I am told that if one comma is changed in the amendment that passes the Senate from the form in which it passed the House, it will run into problems in conference. So because I do not want it to run into problems in conference--I want it done--I have decided, as has the Senator from Nevada, Mr. REID, that we will forgo our desire for the 30-day period. We will endorse the 60-day period because that is in the House bill. 
   Now, the Senator from Tennessee has some legitimate concerns about the way this is done. I have discussed with him privately and now pledge to him publicly that I will work with him to find a way to inject the General Accounting Office into the congressional review process, something that is not called for at the moment. It is entirely haphazard at the moment. GAO gets involved if some Member of Congress asks them to get involved but not if that request is not made. 
   I am more than willing to say to the Senator from Tennessee that I will work with him to try to inject the GAO into the process, but I do believe that the proper and prudent thing for us to do tonight is to adopt the amendment in exactly the same language as it passed the House and thereby make sure it is not a conferenceable item and is something we will be certain will take place when the conference report is finally approved. 
   With that, Mr. President, I have nothing further to say, unless other Members of this body want to talk about the specific merits of it. I thank my friend from Tennessee for his willingness to work out the essential elements of this and pledge to him again publicly, as I have done privately, that I will work with him to see that we do our very best to accomplish the goal he seeks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. I would like to thank the subcommittee chairman for including a $10 million increase for Centers for Independent Living, part C. However, because of the formula in current law, eighteen states do not receive any increase in funding. I understand that many of the smaller states have not received an increase since 1992. It is not my intention to change the funding formula in an appropriations bill, but I believe this problem needs to be addressed.

   Mr. BENNETT. The National Council on Independent Living and individuals in my own state of Utah, are concerned about individuals with disabilities who reside in underserved areas. NCIL has proposed changing the formula for Centers for Independent Living, part C. Under their proposal, fifty percent of funding will be distributed equally among the states, and fifty percent will be divided among the states based on population. 
   Instead of amending the Rehabilitation Act in this bill to permanently change the formula on this appropriations bill, I propose $5 million of the $10 million increase included in H.R. 4577, be divided equally among the states. The remaining $5 million would be distributed based on current law. Thus every state will receive a funding increase. In small states, this small amount translates to roughly $94,000. Based on letters and phone calls I have received, it appears that the coalition of Independent Living Centers across the country are amenable to this proposal--even the larger states.

    Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of Ms. Loyal Clark, Public Affairs Specialist and administrator of the Senior, Youth, and Volunteer Program in the Uinta National Forest located in my home state of Utah. 
   Ms. Clark has been instrumental in developing a model volunteer program that is clearly the largest in the nation, averaging 10,000 volunteers a year for the past decade. Ms. Clark has worked to ensure that the Uinta National Forest can accommodate and provide quality experiences for the numerous volunteer groups and individuals. When there have been more volunteers than available work, she has not turned them away, but has been able to direct their enthusiasm to adjacent forests and other state, county, and community projects. She is a key contact with the community, ensuring that volunteers know about opportunities and that they are matched with jobs they want to do. 
   Ms. Clark developed and presented a proposal to the forest supervisor to establish volunteer coordinators on each of the ranger districts in the forest. These coordinator positions have helped to provide the necessary staff for the Uinta to manage its huge volunteer program and to complete millions of dollars worth of vital project work, increasing the effectiveness of the Forest's budget by as much as twenty to thirty percent. 
   Ms. Clark has taken an active role to ensure various volunteers are recognized and rewarded. She has organized volunteer award ceremonies in the forest and actively ensures the nominations of volunteers for forest, regional, and national recognition. She is currently the team leader for the Uinta National Forest partnership team, which is active in pursing new partnerships with the forest while also maintaining its current relationships. 
   She has not only made a difference in the Uinta National Forest, but has also visited many of the forest management teams throughout the Intermountain Region and shared her wealth of knowledge and experience in the management of effective volunteer programs. 
   Because of Ms. Clark's career-long commitment to working with volunteers, the United States Forest Service recently presented her with an award for being the National Forest Service  Employee of the Nineties. I congratulate Ms. Clark on her well-deserved award from the Forest Service. 
   In closing, I am pleased to recognize and thank Ms. Loyal Clark today for her sustained efforts to enlist and encourage citizens to take ownership in their national forests and communities through volunteering.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Utah West Desert Land Exchange Act of 2000. I am pleased that my friend and colleague, Senator HATCH, joins me in introducing this important legislation. 
   The Utah Enabling Act of 1894 granted to the state four sections, each section approximately 640 acres in size, in each 36 square-mile township. These lands were granted for the support of the public schools, and accordingly are referred to as school trust lands. The location of these lands, as they are not contiguous to each other, has made management by the state difficult. In addition, as school trust lands are interspersed with Federal lands, Federal land designations, such as wilderness study area, have further complicated the state's ability to manage its lands. 
   The Utah West Desert Land Exchange Act of 2000 seeks to resolve these problems through an equal-value, equal-acreage land exchange between the state of Utah and the Federal Government. The lands that will be exchanged are located within the West Desert region of Utah. Each party will exchange approximately 106,000 acres. The Federal government will receive state lands located within wilderness study areas, lands identified as having wilderness characteristics in the Bureau of Land Management's Utah Wilderness Inventory, and lands identified for acquisition in the Washington County Habitat Conservation Plan. The state will receive federal lands that are more appropriate to carry out its mandate to generate revenue for Utah's public schools. 
   I would like to address two issues some have raised about this land exchange. The first issue is regarding land valuation. Both the state of Utah and the Department of the Interior firmly believe that this exchange is approximately equivalent in value. The parties have reached this conclusion after many months of thorough research and evaluation of the parcels to be exchanged. The process of research and evaluation included review of comparable sales, mineral potential, access, and topography. One may ask why each parcel of land was not appraised individually. The answer is that for many of the 175 state parcels it would have cost more to have appraised those lands than their agreed upon value. Please note that the average value of the school trust lands outside of Washington County is $85 per-acre; if each individual parcel was required to be formally appraised the high appraisal costs would place this land exchange, and all of its benefits, in jeopardy. Nevertheless both the state of Utah and the Department of the Interior have maintained their fiduciary responsibility by putting together a package that is equal, in both value and acreage.  
   The second issue that has been raised is in regard to the LaVerkin tract. Governor Leavitt, in his testimony before the United States House of Representatives Committee on Resources, stated: ``I want to assure you the state of Utah will be sensitive to local needs as this tract is developed, and will comply with, and participate in, local planning and zoning decisions. Also, you can be assured the scenic views at the entrance to Zion National Park will be protected to the maximum extent practicable,'' It is my hope that this commitment made by Governor Levitt will satisfy those concerned by the exchange of the LaVerkin tract. 
   The Utah West Desert Land Exchange Act of 2000 is the result of over 12 months of negotiations between the state of Utah and the Department of the Interior. For too long the school trust lands in the West Desert have been held captive by neighboring federal lands, unable to produce the revenue that are legally required to for Utah's schools. This bill provides that Congress with an opportunity to reduce the state of Utah's holdings in Federal wilderness study areas and other sensitive areas while increasing lands that are more suitable for long-term economic development to the state of Utah for its school children. Additionally, the Federal Government will consolidate its ownership in the existing wilderness study area, which will allow for more consistent management. This bill is a win-win proposal, and the right thing to do. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation in the remaining months of the session.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to praise the hard work, commitment and diligence of Senator SPENCER ABRAHAM of Michigan. He navigated truly treacherous legislative and political waters to bring this legislation to shore. Were it not for his steadfast guidance of this legislation, there would be no E-Sign bill before us today. From the outset, Senator ABRAHAM had the vision and initiative to call to life a law which will allow American consumers and businesses to do transactions over the Internet with a greater confidence in their legal rights and responsibilities. And let me say this to my colleague, Senator ABRAHAM, this bill is much like the Internet in that almost instantaneously all kinds of people will come out of the woodwork to claim credit for your great achievement. Savor it, because those of us who worked by your side know well that the credit lies with you. 
   Throughout the conference I kept one goal in mind. We must make every effort to have a digital signature be equal to a paper signature both in the ease of use and in the eyes of the law. And while we did not fully succeed in that regard, this legislation is clearly a worthwhile step in the right direction and I intend to support its passage. 
   Mr. President, let me take one more moment to express, generally, some of my concerns about provisions that were added in the name of providing greater consumer protection and which were outside of the scope of the bills passed in the House and the Senate. I fear that the lack of clarity of several terms and phrases which were added in the conference and which are strewn throughout the bill will create the opportunity for misunderstandings and lawsuits. Greater consultation among the conferees could have resolved these issues, because I know that we all share the same hopes for the success of this legislation. I sincerely hope that my concerns about the use of these terms is misplaced and that they will not come back to haunt us. 
   Finally, Mr. President, pursuant to the Government Paperwork Elimination Act passed by the previous Congress, the Office of Management and Budget has adopted regulations to permit individuals to obtain, submit and sign government forms electronically. These regulations direct Federal agencies to recognize that different security approaches offer varying levels of assurance in an electronic environment and that deciding which to use in an application depends first upon finding a balance between the risks associated with the loss, misuse or compromise of the information, and the benefits, costs and effort associated with deploying and managing the increasingly secure methods to mitigate those risks. 
   The OMB regulations recognize that among the various technical approaches, in an ascending level of assurance, are (1) ``shared secrets'' methods (e.g., personal identification numbers or passwords), (2) digitized signatures or biometric means of identification, such as fingerprints, retinal patterns and voice recognition, and (3) cryptographic digital signatures, which provide the greatest assurance. Combinations of approaches (e.g., digital signatures with bio-metrics) are also possible and may provide even higher levels of assurance. The technical competence and experience of the service provider should be of paramount concern as we step into this brave new world. A positive first step in this regard is the General Services Administration's development of the ACES, or Access Certification for Electronic Services, Program for all federal agencies. 
   Mr. President, in developing this legislation, we recognized that certain technologies are more secure than others and that consumers and businesses must, just as the government, select and weigh which technology is most appropriate for their particular needs taking into account the importance of the transaction and its corresponding need for assurance.

    Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator SCHUMER. I wanted to thank my colleague and his staff for their hard work and full partnership in arriving at what I believe is a critical first step to insuring this nation's security in a world of growing cyber threats. I have been concerned for some time now that Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63) does not clearly define a role for the Department of Defense (DOD). In one sentence, PDD 63 states that the DOD is assigned the role of ``defense'' but does not elaborate on how it will accomplish this vague assignment. Our legislation will require that the DOD begin the thinking process of how it is integrating its different capabilities and assets into an ``indications and warning architecture.'' Each of the Services is developing its individual information warfare capabilities at this moment, and it is not clear how they are being integrated or coordinated. The DOD was supposed to report on the future of the National Communications System (NCS) in 1996 and 1997, but as far as I know that report was never completed. NCS has been identified as a unique public-private partnership with major telephone carriers and information systems providers and could be a useful entity to defend against a widespread attack. 
   This bill will require the DOD to describe how it is working with the intelligence community to identify, detect and counter the threat of information warfare programs of hostile states and potentially hostile sub-national organizations. One thing my Y2K experience has made very clear to me is that the coordination of intelligence and the proper identification of threat and intention is increasingly difficult. We often lack the human intelligence, just plain people on the ground, to meet the growing need for reconnaissance, and that makes coordinated and integrated technology all the more important. 
   We must begin to work from a position of having a consistent understanding of the terms we use. It is central to this idea that we define the terms: nationally ``significant cyber event'' and ``cyber reconstitution.'' PDD 63 and the National Plan do not define what these are and the lack of definition causes confusion and impedes program development. 
   Also, during Y2K we found that the DOD has a large dependency on foreign infrastructure and that we must develop a way to assure and defend that infrastructure electronically. Any collapse of an infrastructure would hurt our force projection capabilities. 
   Our offensive and defensive information operations need to evolve together in an integrated fashion. We need to identify elements of a defense against an information warfare attack, including how the capability of the U.S. Space Command's Computer Network Attack Capability will be integrated into the overall cyber defense of the U.S. 
   Mr. President, in closing I cannot overemphasis my concern for a thoughtful approach to cyber-defense. As many of us have become painfully aware, the threats are increasing at unheard of rates and our defenses, even in the government, have not kept pace.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as chairman of the legislative branch subcommittee of appropriations, I would like to take a few minutes to describe S. 2603, the legislative branch appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2001. 
   The bill, as reported by the Appropriations Committee, provides for $1,721,077,000 in new budget authority exclusive of the House items. This is a $58,607,000 increase over fiscal year 2000. It is $146,770,000 below the President's request. 
   The subcommittee's allocation is 1.8 percent above last year's funding level, which is the $43 million increase. 
   We are being very frugal with the legislative branch. I think we are doing a responsible job of keeping the overall increase at a level that is defensible. 
   We are not allowing the legislative branch appropriations to grow faster than inflation. We are not allowing it to grow faster than the population. And the demands that are made upon the legislative branch we are keeping under 2 percent. 
   It was a challenge to draft a bill that stayed within this allocation because, as always happens, there was $20 million of new items that Congress committed to in previous years but which had not been funded. Therefore, they were not included in last year's base. 
   If we were going to talk about an increase over last year's base, but we had $20 million worth of obligations that were not included in that base, we realized that it created a tension and a pressure on the committee. But that is what we have to do when we are dealing with budgets. I have dealt with budgets in the business world and understand that this is not an unusual 
   kind of challenge. 
   The mandatory increases that we have in the bill alone account for $54 million, exclusive of the House, on top of the situation which I have just described, 
   Senator FEINSTEIN, the ranking member, and I spent a great deal of time going over the accounts with our respective staffs and the increases that agencies have had over the last 4 years in an effort to find where we could best and most fairly cut without impacting employees. One of our goals was to see to it that no one was laid off as a result of the budgetary pressures on this year's bill. I am happy to say that we have met that goal in this bill. 
   There will be no reduction in force as a result of the Senate's action, if this bill is adopted, and no employees currently working in the legislative branch will lose their jobs. The subcommittee's goal was to ensure that would be the case.  
   There has been a great deal of discussion and concern in the press expressed over the House Appropriations Committee's first reported targets. Those targets were reported out of subcommittee with cuts of almost $105 million below the fiscal year 2000 level. 
   It is my understanding that the House now plans in their legislative process to increase this bill by $85 million before it comes up for floor consideration. I hope those reports are accurate and that the House does, indeed, move in that direction. 
   We do not want to criticize the actions of the other body in this body. We simply want to lay out what we think is the logical thing to do. 
   I hope those who have been focused on the press reports of what was proposed on the other side of the Capitol initially will recognize that there is a great deal of legislative action that has to take place between initial proposals and final passage. Certainly we are doing our best on the Senate side to make a contribution to see to it that final passage achieves the goal that I have outlined; that is, the goal that says there will be no reduction in force in the legislative branch.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, to make the record clear with respect to the statement that was made earlier about employees of the Government Printing Office not receiving an increase in this bill, Senator FEINSTEIN and I have provided funds so those employees will receive the mandatory increases. 
   It is a little bit confusing as to how the bookkeeping works. The dollar amount stays level, but because we researched the number of positions that had not been filled in previous years and we are funding those positions, we recognize the money that would go for those unfilled positions will be available for the mandatory increases for employees. 
   I want to make sure the record reflects that. We are not, in fact, forcing those employees to go without their standard mandatory increases in this bill.

   Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for raising this issue because it is a very legitimate issue, and I think it is a legitimate issue for the legislative branch subcommittee to deal with. We did not deal with it in subcommittee and in full committee. It becomes a challenge to try to find the money right now in terms of an offset within the bill. 
   The point the Senator from Pennsylvania makes is an extremely valid one. There are people who, in rural areas particularly, do not really have any sense of opportunity to interact with a Senator unless that Senator physically goes to those counties. Then when you try to notify the people that you are coming, you have a real challenge because they do not have the mass media coverage. Yes, they may get a major newspaper from a major metropolitan area, but they do not read it for hometown announcements. If you try local newspapers, many times they do not do the job, either. 
   The problem we have in terms of the reactions from members of the Rules Committee is that the Rules Committee has attempted to create the opportunity for this in terms of flexibility for the overall budget and saying to a Senator, ``You have a pot of money you can use either for franking or for stationery, for travel, or some other item,'' and they are opposed to earmarking a particular amount of money for this particular purpose. 
   If we sit down with members of the Rules Committee and lay out the importance of what it is the Senator from Pennsylvania is highlighting and talk it through to find some creative way, I think we can move in that direction. I pledge to the Senator from Pennsylvania that I will work with him to see if we cannot do that because I agree absolutely with the end he is trying to achieve. 
   I think it is very important that we try to help Members communicate with their constituents in a meaningful kind of way. 
   As I understand it, from the Senator from Pennsylvania, this is not talking about a mass mailing of campaign literature, as we are accused of doing under newsletters and use of the franking. This is talking about simply a notice that would go out under the frank with respect to town meetings. 
   I am very sympathetic with that and would be happy to work with the Senator and the Senators from the Rules Committee and, of course, Senator FEINSTEIN, to see if we can't find a way to devise something that is not overly expensive--because I agree with the Senator, not every Senator would want to use it--but that at the same time we could provide an opportunity for those Senators who would be willing to do the town meeting. 
   So I am happy to deal with the Senator to see if we can't find way to work this out.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we come to the time where we have another 25 minutes before the time comes for voting. I had been expecting the Senator from Alaska. He is still tied up in a previous meeting. So we will look forward to hearing from him. 
   It has been an interesting experience for me to serve as chairman of this particular subcommittee on Appropriations. There are those who say this subcommittee does not matter very much because its dollar allocation is the lowest of all of the subcommittees in the Appropriations Committee, with the exception of the District of Columbia. I disagree. I think this subcommittee, in fact, can have as much impact on the Government as some of the others that have greater amounts of money to spend because of its area of jurisdiction. 
   I will take a little of the time here to express my gratitude for the opportunity of chairing this subcommittee and for those with whom we work. The subcommittee deals with the Architect of the Capitol. That is a term that most people in the country do not understand. They would think of the Architect of the Capitol as the person who sits down and draws the lines on paper that produces the building of the Capitol. That is what architects do. 
   They do not realize that the Architect of the Capitol is charged with the responsibility of maintaining the Capitol. In this situation, I have been able to go around and meet those people who oversee the activities that go on with respect to maintaining our operation. They work for the Architect of the Capitol, and they are concerned with such things as the air-conditioning, the cleaning, the repairs, the restoration of the Brumidi paintings about which the Senator from West Virginia spoke.  
   We take it for granted that this beautiful place will always remain beautiful. It takes a virtual army of people working behind the scenes to see that this is, in fact, the case. 
   I have spoken of my business experience. I remember one company where I worked where a particular manager was under very heavy pressure from top management to show improved results on the bottom line. This manager was determined to do that. Pretty soon the reports started coming in that the bottom line was getting better and getting better, and he basked in the glow of the approval that he got for his tough measures and his great turnaround procedures. 
   Then the bill came due, and we discovered what he had been doing. He had been increasing his bottom line by cutting back on his maintenance budget. And all of a sudden the facilities over which he had responsibility began to show the deterioration. In that company, we ultimately had to pay enormous capital costs to restore the facilities to the level they should have been at by virtue of significant day-to-day maintenance. Yes, he could make the bottom line look better temporarily by shutting down the day-to-day maintenance, but, overall, he cost us a great deal of money. 
   That is the responsibility of the Architect of the Capitol: To see to it that, overall, this entire complex works. It is not only the Capitol. He has the responsibility for the Senate office buildings and the House office buildings. 
   We have watched the renovation of the Dirksen Office Building go forward under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol. I am happy to be able to report that it is on time and under budget. For those who say that every Federal program is a boondoggle, this is one that is moving forward. As an occupant of a Dirksen Building suite in the renovated area, I can tell you that this office space will be good for the next 30 or 40 years before it has to be done again. It is being done properly, it is being done intelligently, and it is being done within the allocated budget. 
   Something that I did not know anything about until I became chairman of this subcommittee is the Botanic Garden. 
   I have all my life driven by the Botanic Gardens without ever going in and without ever having any understanding of what went on inside. The Architect of the Capitol came to me when I got this assignment and said: Let's go down and take a look at the Botanic Gardens. Well, one walk through the Botanic Gardens made it clear that there had been a lot of delay and neglect of ordinary maintenance. This was a major mess. 
   Now, under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens are being raised up to the level where they should be. One may ask: Who cares about the Botanic Gardens? I asked the somewhat impudent question: How many Americans come to the Botanic Gardens? How many see this? Well, if it were in a city other than Washington, DC, it would be a major tourist attraction. There are literally millions of Americans who go through the Botanic Gardens every year. It had been allowed to deteriorate and had to be brought up to proper standards. 
   I could go on and on about the work of the Architect of the Capitol. It is significant work, and it requires a great deal of effort. I am delighted to be involved in understanding that. 
   I see other Members coming to the floor. I want them to know I am not filibustering, but I don't want the time to go just in a quorum call, when I have an opportunity to express my gratitude for the assignment that I have. If anyone has something they want to say, just give me a signal and I will conclude quickly. 
   Absent that, I will talk about the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson building is one of the hidden jewels, architecturally, in this town. I always tell tourists from Utah, when they come and visit me in my office, to go see the Jefferson building. They say: Well, we are going to go see the major sites. We are going to go to the Vietnam War Memorial. We are going to go to the Lincoln Memorial and the Jefferson Memorial and the new FDR Memorial, and so on. I only have so much time. 
   I say: I don't care how limited your time is. If you have any time at all, walk down the street and walk into the Jefferson building. 
   This is the most beautiful building on Capitol Hill except for the Capitol itself. It represents in many ways the story of America. 
   My favorite story about the Library of Congress and the building is one that is told about Boris Yeltsin, when he walked into the Jefferson building. He stood there and looked around, and then turned to his guide and said: How did you Americans get a building like this? You didn't have any czars? 
   Well, maybe we didn't have any czars, but we had the Army Corps of Engineers, and we had the American spirit 100 years ago that said America has arrived. America is going to take its place as one of the major nations of the world. In that spirit of enthusiasm and excitement, they built the Jefferson building to house the Library of Congress. That building came in under budget and on time. It stands as a reminder of the spirit of manifest destiny that we associate with Theodore Roosevelt. The building was finished before Theodore Roosevelt became President, but it was in that era that it happened. That is a reminder that all Americans ought to have as part of their history. 
   It has been magnificently restored by the Congress, and by this subcommittee. Admittedly, it was restored prior to my being involved with the subcommittee, but it is something we in Congress should be proud of because it is part of the heritage we leave to our children and our grandchildren. They can come to Capitol Hill--yes, the Capitol and the continuity of democracy that is represented here--but there is also the commitment to knowledge and spreading that knowledge that is represented by the largest and finest library in the world. It exists to serve the Congress. It is sustained by the Congress. It is part of the responsibility of this particular subcommittee. 
   I am delighted with the opportunity of serving in this capacity. I appreciate the support we have received not only from the full committee but from all of the Members of the Senate as well. 
   I see my friend from Connecticut is here. I am happy to yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing this issue to my attention. Like him, members of my staff have also had their children enrolled in the Little Scholars Center and speak highly of the staff and quality of the care there. In this competitive job market, it is very important that Legislative Branch child care centers be able to attract and retain quality staff. I share the Senator from Vermont's goal that health and retirement benefits are extended to employees of the Library of Congress' child care center as soon as possible. 
   I inform Senator JEFFORDS that I have received a copy of a memo, dated May 24, from Teresa Smith, Director of the Library's Human Resource Services, to John D. Webster, Director of the Library's Financial Services, committing to working out a fair and equitable agreement on the issue of extending benefits to employees of the center with the governing board of the child care center. Rest assured, my staff and I will be monitoring the Library's progress towards this goal with the intent that this issue be resolved before the beginning of the next fiscal year.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I, like other Members of the body, read this morning's paper and read the comments of the Democratic leader. I have heard the comments on the floor of some of our colleagues, including the current occupant of the chair, and the Senator from Idaho. Since it is somewhat of a slow day, I decided to add my voice to the voices that have been raised here, perhaps from a slightly different perspective. 
   I know, in Senate terms, I am a relative newcomer. I am only in my second term. And around here, that counts for little more than being in your first term, but it does not put you in the rank of Senate historians or the old Senate ``bulls,'' as they used to be called. 
   Nonetheless, if I might, I would like to go back and quote a little personal history because my first exposure to the Senate, up close and personal, came in the early 1950s. 
   If I may reminisce with you, I remember sitting in the family gallery, night after night, when the Senate would be debating, listening to the oratory that went on and the clashes of opinion that would occur, and falling in love with the place. I was a teenager. 
   My father had been elected in the election of 1950. I was here in the summer of 1953. Dwight Eisenhower was the President--the first time a Republican President had been in office since 1932. The Democrats were apoplectic about the idea that there was a Republican President, and carrying on with great frustration. 
   I remember the towering debates--and they were debates. They were not  speeches given to empty Chambers. They were debates between the two protagonists on the Finance Committee. 
   Paul Douglas, the Senator from Illinois, would come down here and thunder against the terrors of the Eisenhower administration. I would listen, in the family gallery, as a Republican, and wonder if anybody could respond. Then Eugene Millikin would enter the Chamber, bad back and all. He sat there in that seat in front of me. It was very difficult for him to move because of his back. So when he would turn, he would turn his entire body, and it would be slow. I remember, clearly, Senator Douglas recognizing what had happened when Senator Millikin had come on the floor. Senator Millikin was the chairman of the Finance Committee. 
   Senator Douglas said: The Republicans have brought up their heavy artillery in bringing in Senator Millikin. He said: In fact, I would even say they have brought their nuclear cannon. 
   I sat in the family gallery and listened to this, and thought: What is going to happen now? 
   Senator Millikin, with a few well-placed barbs, proceeded to destroy Senator Douglas' argument. And Senator Douglas got mad. He started complaining about the fact that the Senator from Colorado--because that is where Millikin was from--had as much authority in this body as he did, the Senator from Illinois. He pointed out how many people there were in Illinois and how few people there were in Colorado, and he got very indignant about it. 
   I remember Millikin's response. He said: Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is no longer opposed to the bill before us, he is now opposed to the Constitution. I must say, I am not surprised. 
   With that, he turned on his heels and walked out, leaving Senator Douglas sputtering a bit. 
   So I go back that far with my experiences with the Senate. I served in the Nixon administration as a lobbyist for one of the Departments. We did not call it that because under the law you are not allowed to lobby as a member of the executive branch; you conduct congressional liaison. 
   Again, because my father was still a Member of the Senate, I had access to the family gallery. When my Department had a bill before the Senate, I would come and sit in the family gallery and watch the debate as the bills would pass--or not pass--and I remember very clearly the pattern of debate in those days. This is now in the late 1960s because I served in the Nixon administration, and President Nixon took office in 1969. 
   Votes would be scheduled in advance, with a specific time. The time that sticks in my memory is that 11 o'clock was a fairly normal time for votes. We would get into the gallery around 10, because the debate would be winding up in anticipation of the 11 o'clock vote. 
   Senators would start coming into the Chamber by 10:15. I would say, there would be 30 Senators in the Chamber listening to the final debate. 
   By 10:30, the Chamber would be almost full, because at 10:30, Everett Dirksen, as the Republican leader, would stand up to give the Republican position, the final speaker prior to the vote. Everyone wanted to hear Everett Dirksen. He would go on for 15 minutes, until a quarter to 11. By this time, the Chamber would be completely filled--every Senator in his or her seat. 
   Then Mike Mansfield would stand up, with the tremendous respect and dignity that he had. If I may say so, without diminishing that respect, Mike Mansfield, as an orator, was no match for Everett Dirksen. He was not as fun to listen to, but he had an earnestness and a determination about him that made him a towering giant of this body. 
   Then at 11 o'clock, when Mike Mansfield would be through, whoever was presiding would bang the gavel, and the Senate would proceed to vote, with every Senator sitting at his desk. 
   I remember watching my father, who sat on the front row to the right, go up to the table and get a copy of the names of all of the Senators, and keep track of how they were voting himself. He would mark it off, as did all of the other Senators, just the way the clerk marks it off. 
   The only time I have seen that happen since I have been in the Senate is when, during the impeachment trial, I went down and got one of those records, and I sat and made my own record of every Senator's vote in impeachment. I thought it was a significant enough event to revive that custom. 
   Why am I going through this history? For one reason. Because I read in this morning's paper the accusation made by the Democratic leader that what the Republican majority leader has been doing these last few days is leading to the erosion of the history and sanctity of the Senate, leading to a destruction of this institution. 
   I give you this history as my credentials, as one who wants to comment on this institution, who wants to talk about what is going on and what has gone on. No, I will not engage in a debate with the Democratic leader as to whether there was or was not precedent of what he has done. My friend from Idaho has done that, and that is appropriate. 
   But I am not here to do that. I am here to talk about this institution and what has happened to it in the roughly 50 years since I sat as a teenager in the family gallery and fell in love with it. 
   It is a little startling to me I can talk about that being nearly 50 years ago, but it was. As I say, I was a teenager. Now I am beginning to look forward to the time when I will be 70. I assure my constituents it is a long way away, but in fact it is in about 3 years. 
   What has happened to the institution in a half a century of my observations of it? If I go back to the old institution--that is, the institution that I knew in those years--appropriations bills were the least controversial of any bills. Appropriations bills passed without discussion, debate, or confusion. The institution assumed that the Appropriations Committee knew what it was doing. The major debates were over authorization bills. Once something was authorized, it was the duty of the appropriators to come up with a legitimate amount of money, and there was no attempt to saddle appropriations bills with controversial riders or amendments. It simply was not done. 
   The appropriations process was considered the most routine of any process that was carried on around here. Oh, there was partisanship in those days. There were bitter speeches, as the kind I have just described between Senator Douglas and Senator Millikin, but there was no attempt to use the rules of the institution to slow down the appropriations process for political benefit. 
   It simply wasn't done. It was simply not considered acceptable in this institution. Now we do it. Now it happens. I can't put my finger on the turning point at which it happened, but I think I can identify one important point along the road, and it happened while I was in the Senate. 
   In 1995, a gentleman for whom I have utmost respect as a political tactician and strategist, Newt Gingrich, made a serious miscalculation. I remember discussing it with him sitting over in what is now the Lyndon Johnson Room, as he came over from the House to tell us in the Senate what they were going to do in the House. 
   They were going to deliver the coup de grace to the Clinton administration by forcing the President to accept a balanced budget agreement, and the reason they would force the President to do that is that they would use the appropriations process to put leverage on him. 
   I remember a number of us saying to him, ``Well, Newt, what happens if the President doesn't cave?'' He said, ``What do you mean, if the President doesn't cave? This President not caving in? Are you kidding me?'' He went down example after example where President Clinton had caved under pressure from the Congress. He said, ``This will be the final example that we have taken control in the Congress, we have seized it from the executive branch, and we will make him a lame duck for the last 2 years of his term. This is the crucial moment at which the Congress demonstrates its power.'' 
   I asked, and a number of others asked, ``Wonderful, Newt, but what if it doesn't work?'' He said, ``What do you mean, what if it doesn't work? Of course, it will work. What do you mean, what if he doesn't cave? Of course, he will cave.''  
   Speaker Gingrich, in a massive miscalculation, set in motion a series of actions that ultimately ended up in a partial shutdown of the Federal Government. As the shutdown went on, we Republicans did our best to try to explain that it was all Bill Clinton's fault. We did our best to say it was all the responsibility of the administration. And the press did its best to tell everybody it was all our fault. 
   Ultimately, the Republican leader on this side, Bob Dole, stood here and said, ``Enough is enough, we are going to put the Government back to work.'' Senator Dole's instincts were right, and Speaker Gingrich's instincts were wrong, and the Republicans paid an enormous electoral price for Newt Gingrich's mistake in the 1996 election. We frittered away our opportunity to win back the Presidency, and we saw our margins in the House of Representatives go down in that election. 
   I think that was a watershed event because I think the people in the White House discovered that if they could use the appropriations process to create a crisis that would be seen as a Government shutdown by the Republicans, they could get political advantage. The appropriations process has never been the same. The White House negotiators have been much tougher since that happened. The demands coming out of the White House have been much more significant, and the threat is: We will veto, we will veto, we will veto; the Government will shut down, and you Republicans will get blamed for it. You have to give us what we want. 
   We have seen the appropriations power move from the legislative branch to the executive branch, under the threat of a veto and the threat of a Government shutdown. That is a sea change in constitutional structure and a sea change in politics that has happened while I have been in the Senate. That is part of what is going on right now. Right now, under instructions from the White House, the Democrats are saying: Let us do whatever we can to get ourselves in a situation where we can rerun the movie of 1995 in the fall of 2000. Look at how it helped us in the election of 1996 to keep Bill Clinton in office. Look at how it will help us in 2000 to get AL GORE into office. 
   So an appropriations bill comes along: Let's do everything we 
   can to slow it down. An appropriations bill comes on the floor: Let's do everything we can to increase the amount of debate time. We may end up voting for the appropriations bill, but that is not the point. It isn't a question of, do we vote for it or do we vote against it? It is a question of, how much can we slow it down so as to create the opportunity to rerun 1995 one more time? That is part of what is going on. 
   Another thing that is going on that you never would find in the old Senate--again, by ``old Senate,'' I mean that time I saw during my father's 24 years here. It used to be that when the Senate voted on an issue, it passed or it failed, and it was done with. If it came back to be voted on again on the part of those who had lost, it came back in a new Congress when there had been an election and, presumably, people changed their minds. It never was the case that something was voted on again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again in the same Congress. They never used to do that. Certainly, they never used to do it with rollcall votes. 
   I remember when Lyndon Johnson was the majority leader--this story has been told many times, but it is worth recounting here--a Senator came to him with an amendment, and Johnson said, ``Fine, we will accept it.'' The Senator said, ``I want a vote.'' Johnson said, ``No, you don't want a vote. We will accept it.'' ``No, let's debate it and have a vote.'' So they debated it, and it was defeated, with Johnson voting against it and using his power as the majority leader to kill it. The Senator came to him and said, ``You said you would accept this.'' Johnson said, ``Yes, but you didn't let me. You insisted on wasting the time of the Senate to have a debate and a vote, and I am telling you, you don't do that anymore. You don't do that ever again.'' The Senator learned. 
   We have rollcall votes around here on everything. We will have a resolution to memorialize Mother's Day, and someone will ask for the yeas and nays, and we will spend a half hour voting, 100-0, and it slows everything down. Why do we do that? Well, maybe on Mother's Day we all want to be on record saying we are for Mother's Day. I will tell you why we do it--and, again, it is something that never would have been done 30 years ago. We do it to build a record for campaign purposes, not for legislative purposes. 
   The Senate has become a campaign-focused organization rather than a legislative-focused organization. I will give you my own experience with this. When I ran in 1998, my opponent stood up before the crowds, on television, whatever, and said, ``Senator Bennett is pro-tobacco.'' Pardon me? ``Absolutely. Look at his record. He voted with the tobacco interests 12 different times.'' I did? I was there. I didn't remember voting with the tobacco interests once. ``No, he is lying about his record. Here it is.'' 
   Then we go into the web site where he has all of this listed under the fetching title, ``What Senator Bennett Doesn't Want You To Know,'' and here is the list of all of my ``pro-tobacco'' votes. What were they? They were procedural votes, votes on motions to table, votes in support of the leader moving legislation forward. 
   On the one tobacco vote that counted, which was a cloture vote on Senator MCCAIN's bill, I was in the antitobacco forces; and, indeed, I had and used, during the campaign, letters thanking me for my strong antitobacco stand from the American College of Pediatric Surgeons, et cetera, et cetera. All of the people who were involved in the tobacco fight knew I was on their side. They knew the process around here well enough to know these 12 votes about which my opponent was talking were meaningless as far as the real issue was concerned. 
   I will tell you what I said to him. We checked his FEC report, and I said to my opponent: You paid $20,000 to a computer firm to research my voting record and come up with this list. 
   I recommend you call them and get your money back because you wasted it. They gave you wrong information. 
   He said I was pro-liquor. He had a voting record that said I was in favor of alcohol. Pardon me? We got into it. We found out what the vote was that I supposedly cast that made me pro-alcohol. It had to do with Federal highway funds and the rights of the States to set their own levels of alcohol tolerance, and because I am in favor of States controlling that and voted against having the Federal Government dictate it, suddenly I had cast a pro-alcohol vote. He went on and on and on in this same vein. 
   I understand what is going on here. Amendments are not being offered for legislative purposes. Bills are not being called up for legislative purposes. Recorded votes are not being called for because someone wants to improve the legislation. Records are being built on issues that can be misrepresented as serious challenges to incumbents. They are being brought up again and again and again so that people can stand up in a campaign and say that the incumbent voted wrong 17 times. Lyndon Johnson would not have stood for it. Everett Dirksen would have had a quip about it that would make everybody laugh. But it is now the way things are done in this institution. 
   I said that I am responding to the suggestion of the Democratic leader that somehow what is going on here is destructive of the institution. I agree that what is going on is destructive of the institution. But I do not put it at the feet of the majority leader. I think it has historic roots that go back beyond this majority leader and that go back before the previous majority leaders. I don't know when it started happening, but we have come a long way from the day when the Senate would vote with a rollcall vote about 50 times in a session--that is how often my father voted on rollcall votes--a day when the Chamber would fill up to hear the debate because it was a significant vote. We have come a long way from that. 
   The institution has become primarily a campaign platform. Let us make no mistake about it. What is going on right now in the Chamber is all geared to November and not in any sense geared toward legislation. It is not geared toward solving problems. It is not geared toward moving the Republic forward. It is all geared toward getting those multiple votes that a computer  can find and then put it on a web site that can be used in a campaign speech on the part of the challenger. 
   I agree with the Democratic leader that this cheapens the institution. I agree with the Democratic leader that it threatens the institution. But I disagree with him as to the solution. 
   I think all Senators need to back away from the idea that the primary purpose of being in the Senate is to give campaign speeches, and back away from the idea that the primary function of coming to the floor is to do things that will give you an advantage in November and so you can misrepresent and attack an incumbent. There is a time for partisanship, and there is a time to be very firm about the position that you take. But there is also a time to recognize that the institution is threatened if you let partisanship get out of hand. 
   It reminds me of the signature comment that comes to us out of the Vietnam War where, I believe, a captain was quoted as saying after a particular battle that it was ``necessary to destroy the village in order to pacify it.'' If it is necessary to destroy the institution of the Senate in order to make it part of my party's control, I want no part of that activity. In my own campaign, I have refused to engage in negative advertising. I want no part of what I call ``Carville-ism''; that is, the politics of personal destruction that has become so prevalent in the last 8 years. I want no part of it. 
   I remember a man saying to me: If you do not go negative, you will not win the nomination. 
   I said to him: The nomination is not worth it. I would rather retain my self-respect than gain a seat in the Senate. Fortunately, I have both. 
   I say to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--because Republicans campaign just as vigorously as Democrats--let's stop using the Senate as an institution solely for campaign purposes. Let's stop using the rules of the Senate that can allow votes and that can call up amendments solely for the purpose of creating campaign records. Let's recognize that the purpose of the Senate is for legislation, not campaigning. 
   If we can do that, we will not get back to the days that I have described, but we will at least get towards them in the sense that this institution will survive, as we like to call it, ``the greatest deliberative body in the world'' and not ``the greatest campaign forum in the world.'' 
   I thank the Chair for his patience. I thank my colleagues for their indulgence as I have taken this memory trip. But I hope that all of us will recognize that we have something to learn from the past and from the kind of institution this once was, and we have a responsibility to see to it that it does not degenerate into what it could be. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I take the floor today to introduce the Ute-Moab Land Restoration Act, a proposal that enjoys great support from the State of Utah and many of my constituents. This legislation contains two major components that will enable the restoration of Ute Indian Tribal lands and the remediation of a uranium mill tailings site near Moab, Utah. 
   The first component is the transfer of the Naval Oil Shale Reserve Numbered 2 (NOSR 2) lands east of the Green River to the Ute Indian Tribe. The lands that contain the NOSR 2 were taken from the Ute tribe in 1916 by the government to provide the Navy with a source of petroleum for oil-burning ships. This transfer will return these traditional homelands to the Ute tribe. Additionally, the return of these lands will spur economic development on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation, home of the Ute Tribe. The increased economic development will include oil and gas production. It should be noted that the Ute Tribe has a history of environmentally responsible petroleum development on one of Utah's largest oil and gas fields. The bill also incorporates a provision whereby a nine percent royalty will be returned to the Secretary of Energy for the purposes of offsetting the cost of removing the Atlas tailings pile as I shall describe in a moment. I expect the tribe will give all future petroleum developments the same amount of care they have demonstrated in the past. 
   The economy of the Uintah Basin will not be the sole beneficiary of the land transfer. There are numerous conservation provisions incorporated into the transfer. These provisions include the establishment of a quarter mile corridor along 75 miles of the Green River to conserve its scenic qualities and protections for wild horses and threatened and endangered plants life. 
   The second component will facilitate the removal of the tailings from the Atlas uranium milling site across the Colorado River from Moab, Utah. It should be noted that the determination to locate the Atlas milling facility at MOAB was driven by encouragement from the former Atomic Energy Commission. Further, the Department of Energy (DOE) bears responsibility for approximately 56 percent of the 10.5 million tons of mildly radioactive debris left as a residue from the Cold War and our nation's effort to maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile. These tailings, produced from 156 to 1988, are currently leaching ammonia into the waters of the Colorado River. Additionally, the pile is a significant source of airborne radon. Both of these pollutants need to be addressed. 
   In January of this year, Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson announced the intention of DOE to move the Atlas tailings pile to a remote location where this waste could be contained in a sealed cell. This proposal follows work done previously by DOE on 22 former uranium mill tailings sites. The legislation I am introducing today amends the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) by adding the Atlas tailings site as the 23rd site for DOE 
   remediation. 
   I note that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted a lengthy five-year environmental impact statement on the Atlas site. Its  conclusion held that the site could be remediated in place by dewatering the pile, treating the ground water, and capping the tailings. Indeed, the NRC has appointed a trustee that is moving forward with this remediation process today. However, given the interests of the State of Utah and the people of Grand County, I am introducing this legislation so the tailings can be removed and treated in a more secure manner. 
   I am concerned that securing the funding for this clean-up may be difficult. Therefore, I have a included a provision which will enable the NRC trustee to continue on-site remediation up to the point that DOE obtains the necessary appropriations to step up and take over the process. I believe this is the responsible approach to ensure that public health and the environment are protected regardless of the outcome of future appropriations. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in moving this legislation forward and restoring these Utah lands.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today Senator HARRY REID of Nevada and I are introducing bipartisan legislation with respect to the review period for the sale of high-performance computers. Both Senator REID and I were hoping this legislation would not be necessary. We had planned it as an amendment to the Export Administration Act, but that act, for a variety of reasons, has been stalled here on the floor, and the issue is so important that we don't want to let it die. We are introducing this legislation in order to keep the issue alive and, if necessary, to provide a vehicle for producing the review that we think is necessary. 
   Let me display a chart that demonstrates what is happening in the high-tech world of business computers. These are not the computers that we carry back and forth on the planes. You and I, as we fly back to our homes, have laptops and those laptops have amazing capabilities in them and represent the changes that are occurring in the computer world. 
   If I can be personal for just a moment, at one point in my career, I was the head of a company that was grandly called the American Computer Corporation. We produced, among other products, a computer that was about the size of a washing machine. We were very proud of it. It had 10 megabytes of hard disc memory in it, and it sold for about $35,000. It was literally built in a garage, and we sold every single one we could make. 
   Today, I have in my hand a computer that costs less than $500, which has far more power and capacity than that old machine we were so proud of, with its 10 megabytes of hard disc. The laptop I carry with me back and forth between here and Utah has more computing power in it today than the computers that controlled the space shuttle. 
   I have been down to Cape Canaveral to the Kennedy Space Center. I have seen the space shuttle. The space shuttle computers that control the flight of that at this time are very highly technical instruments and are built throughout the entire airplane. They take up so much room that they are part of the superstructure of the airplane itself. Today, there is more computing power in the laptop that I carry than there is in that whole airplane. 
   This is a manifestation of what the people in the computer world call Moore's law. Mr. Moore was one of the first CEOs of Intel. He propounded over 20 years ago Moore's law which says that every 18 months, the power of computers doubles for the same price; so that every 18 months, the computer that you had 18 months ago is now obsolete and the new one is twice as fast. Then, 18 months later the new one will be twice as fast as that one was. And 18 months later, the next new one will be twice as fast, and so on. Moore's law has held for over 20 years. Every 18 months the power of the computer doubles. 
   Moore's law doesn't hold anymore--not because the power of the computer is not doubling but because the power of the computer is doubling in less than 18 months. It is doubling faster than Moore projected in Moore's law. 
   This chart demonstrates what is happening in the world with what we call ``business computers.'' These are computers that are roughly the size of that old computer we produced that was the size of a washing machine, or a college refrigerator. Only now, these computers have the power and capacity that we used to think of in terms of the giant supercomputers that would fill this room. 
   Thereby hangs the issue that has caused me and Senator REID to join together and introduce this piece of legislation. 
   When supercomputers, the huge machines that could do an enormous amount of computation work, were first invented, it was a matter of national security that they be kept out of the hands of America's enemies. So it was established by legislation that there would be a limit on the size of computers that could be exported because we wanted to make sure the supercomputers stayed in American hands. 
   The limit that was placed on supercomputers was at the level of 8,000 MTOPS. I don't mean to be overly technical here, but we need to understand what we are talking about. MTOPS is an acronym for millions of theoretical operations per second. 
   How many theoretical operations or calculations can the computer perform in a second? How many millions can it perform in a second? 
   At the time this legislation was put in place, it said anything over 8 trillion theoretical operations per second constituted a supercomputer, and therefore it had to be protected from export. It had to be held in the United States, for national security purposes. We were the only country in the world that had a computer that could approach 8 trillion MTOPS, or millions of theoretical operations per second. 
   That was then. This is now. 
   I hold in my hand a device that is produced here in America by Intel that  contains eight chips. And therein lies the tale that I want to talk about today. 
   Just think of this. This, by the way, retails for about $900. It is part of the mother board of a traditional business computer today. The mother board is about 2 feet square. This fits on the mother board with all of the other chips that are in 
   it. But this is the controller of all of that. And it has in it eight tiny chips. 
   Here is the marketplace for this kind of computer worldwide. We have the figures. 
   In 1997, worldwide, it is a little over 2 million. 
   You see in the blue down below is the market in the United States, and the green is overseas. You can see that the market overseas is bigger than the market in the United States. 
   The chart marches on with projections made by the Gartner Group out of Connecticut to the year 2002. We see, roughly speaking, that in that 5-year period--from 1997 to 2002--this market will quadruple. We are talking hundreds of billions of dollars per year of market. 
   I want that understood as the matrix of what we are talking about here. 
   This is the size of the market for a product of which this is the heart. 
   Now let's talk about it in terms of export control on MTOPS. 
   I hope we can tie all of these together. I realize this is a little technical. But understand when the legislation was passed, anything that had more than 8,000 MTOPS in it could not be exported, and therefore could not be sold in the green part of that bar. 
   Let's look at what is happening as Moore's law becomes obsolete as the power of computers increases more rapidly. 
   Here is a blowup of this device as it existed in 1999, less than 6 months ago.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to commend my friend from Michigan for his amendment. I endorse the amendment. I think it is only common sense that we deal with this issue. I will make some comments about the underlying bill and what I have heard in this debate and try to put it in some kind of context. 
   First let me outline what credentials I have to comment on this. About a dozen years ago, I was approached by the chair of the Utah State School Board and asked to chair the Strategic Planning Commission that was being followed by that school board to create a strategic plan for Utah schools. 
   Frankly, that was the experience that got me back into public life. I was very comfortably ensconced as CEO of a profitable company and thinking that would be my career for the rest of my life. Getting involved in educational issues, becoming chairman of that planning commission, and laying out a strategic vision for Utah schools got me immersed in the whole education issue. 
   What I discovered 12 years ago--a depressing thing, by the way, and nothing has changed in the intervening 12 years--was that the school system was focusing on the wrong issue. Indeed, we named our report ``A shift in focus'' because we said that was what was going to be necessary to solve the educational problem in this country. 
   All of the focus of the professional educators and people involved in education was on the system: How can we tweak, fine-tune, fund, change, somehow manipulate the system? 
   As we got into it, we said no, the shift should be from focusing on the system and how it works, to focusing on the student and what he needs. 
   I offered this analogy going back again to my business roots. In the automobile world, at one time General Motors focused entirely on the way they made automobiles. They said: These are the automobiles we make. Now, sales department, you go out and sell the automobiles to the public. 
   Toyota came along, a very small company, and said: We are going to ask the drivers what they want in a car, and we are going to focus on drivers rather than cars. As a result, Toyota came up with an entirely different kind of car from those General Motors was producing. The focus was on the driver and not the car. The focus was on the customer and not the company. The company that focused on the customer and on the driver did exceedingly well. Toyota grew from a tiny company to the second largest in the world making automobiles and became, for a time, more profitable than General Motors, until General Motors discovered they had to shift their focus. 
   Instead of saying, this is what we produce, you go buy it; like Toyota, they started asking the question: What do you want? We will go make it. Saturn, a General Motors venture, came out entirely of that activity. 
   That is the analogy I used when I wrote that strategic plan for Utah schools: Instead of focusing on the school system and how it works, focus on the students and what they need. We were asked to come up with a mission statement for education as we did that commission. The mission statement we came up with terrified the superintendent of schools in the State of Utah. He said: You can't say that because if you say that, we will get sued. 
   We went ahead and said it anyway. What we said was: The mission of public education is to empower students to function effectively in society. That is what we are here for, to empower students to function effectively in society. 
   No, no, no, say the professionals; the mission of education is to construct a system that does the following things. 
   We do not measure the system. We measure the ability of the students to function in society. If they cannot function effectively in society, they are not getting a decent education. That was a radical notion 12 years ago. As I say, 12 years have passed and very little has changed. 
   Those are my credentials. That is the background I had coming in and listening to this debate. As I listen to this debate, I have some very, for me, interesting reactions. 
   First, from our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle, we have had an eloquent, continuing, and unrelenting defense of the status quo. Any suggestion that we try to do anything different is met with a stonewall of criticism and fear that somehow something will change. There is an unrelenting defense of the status quo that has been the underlying theme of this entire debate, as far as my friends on the other side of the aisle are concerned. 
   Interestingly enough, an overwhelming defense of the status quo is not what the American people want to hear. So if we go out on the campaign trail for just a moment, we find the Vice President saying we need revolutionary changes in education. There is an article that ran in this morning's Washington Post, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end of my remarks, written by George Will.

   Mr. BENNETT. He is talking about the Vice President's recent talk on education, and he quotes the Vice President as saying:  
   Today, I am proposing a new national commitment to bring revolutionary improvements to our schools--built on three basis principles. First, I am proposing a major national investment to bring revolutionary improvements to our schools. Second, I am proposing a national revolution--  
   And so on. According to Mr. Will, the Vice President used ``revolution,'' ``revolutionary,'' or ``revolutionize'' 8 times in his speech and ``invest,'' a word we know means spending, 14 times. 
   As Mr. Will concludes in his article:  
   The basic Gore position is that the public schools are splendid, and at the same time desperately in need of revolutionary investments.  
   I find a disconnect between the Vice President's rhetoric out on the campaign trail and what we are hearing on the floor today because any attempt on the part of the Republicans to produce something that is different is attacked. Anything we say let's experiment with is attacked. The overwhelming defense of the status quo is underlying everything our friends on the other side of the aisle are saying. 
   From the prospect of the position I had as chairman of that strategic planning commission, I want to look at this fearsome, frightening, Republican proposal that would go into such new ground as to somehow threaten the status quo. It is the most timid, it is  the most small, tiny, incremental kind of revolution I have ever seen. 
   The bill the Republicans are putting forward is, to put a number on it, something like 98-percent status quo. It funds the programs we have now, and it funds them generously. It supports the programs we have now, and it supports them solidly. But it says, putting the smallest toe at the very edge of the smallest possible body of water: Couldn't we just try a couple of things? Couldn't we give 10 States the chance, if they want to--no mandates, no requirements--just 10 States the chance, if they might want to, to try something out? In another area, couldn't we just try 15 States? Boy, that is bold and revolutionary and going to upset the whole world--15 States, if they decide they want to, might be able to try a few things a little differently. 
   These are the threatening kinds of Republican proposals that are coming along that are causing our friends to be so excited about anything that might in any way upset the status quo. If a State finds the Republican proposal is so revolutionary and threatening that it will destroy the State's ability to deliver education to its children, the State does not have to accept it. There is no mandate in this bill at all that says any State has to do any of the things we are giving them the opportunity to do. This is just the first tiny step. From my position as chairman of that strategic planning commission, I would look at the Republican proposal and say: This is timid. This is not nearly what is needed. 
   But I come here and discover it is denounced as somehow so threatening that it is going to bring down the entire educational edifice of the United States. But I repeat, at the same time, there is that kind of attack on Republican willingness to innovate and to even allow States to try a few things. At the same time that kind of attack is going on, the Vice President is going up and down the country demanding revolutionary improvement with major investments. I would like to know what those revolutionary improvements are. I would like to know, in the context of this bill, what changes in the status quo in revolutionary fashion the Vice President has in mind. If you get to the details, the only revolution he is calling for is spending more money on programs that already exist. 
   Let's take a look for just a minute at some past history. I want to read an excerpt from the Washington Post, talking about schools in the District of Columbia. It says:  
   Alarmed by the crises confronting Washington youth, a group of community leaders is urging sweeping changes in D.C. public schools.  
   That does not sound like the status quo is so wonderful. 
   And another:  
   A new consumer guide to the nation's public school system ranks only two urban school systems lower than the D.C. schools.  
   Again, the status quo is not so wonderful. The interesting thing about these quotes from the Washington Post is that they appeared there in 1988, 12 years ago. For 12 years, Republicans have been trying to bring about some changes in the D.C. public schools. I have stood on this floor and debated this issue in the context of the D.C. appropriations bill. Every time we try to try something different in D.C., we are told no, we cannot upset the status quo. 
   Here is another quote from the Washington Post:  
   The malaise that infects the District of Columbia public schools runs deep....... There are problems in every phase of the educational process. There are school system employees who display no interest in the advancement of students, while excellent teachers and administrators are smothered by confusing and contradictory directives....... Instruction is inconsistent. At many schools, the audit said, test results have not been shared with parents and teachers....... The teacher appraisal process has been a joke. In the 1988-1989 school year, not one teacher received a conditional or unsatisfactory rating. On average, 22 percent of the teachers received no evaluation at all. While some excellent teaching was observed, the audit said, the predominant classroom activity involved students copying exercises and directions from books while teachers graded papers at their desks.  
   This appeared in the Washington Post in 1992, some 4 years after the first articles appeared in the Washington Post. 
   What revolutionary changes are we talking about? Every time the Republicans come to the floor and ask for an incremental change, we are told, no, you are undermining the confidence in public schools. 
   For over a dozen years now, in at least the Nation's school district where we have some degree of influence, the public school system has failed the children of the public schools. 
   As I listen to this debate and relive my experiences from memory as being chairman of the Strategic Planning Commission for the Utah State board of education, I realize how timid public policymakers really are, how anxious they are to talk about revolutionary improvements when they are running for office, and how anxious they are to stifle any attempt to bring to pass any sort of revolution when they have the opportunity to make a policy decision. 
   We must recognize, as I said before, this bill as what it is. The underlying bill is not a revolutionary bold attack on the status quo. I wish it were. There are many things that can and should be done. This is just the most timid kind of probing into possibilities, and yet even that is too much, even that is too fearful for those defenders of the status quo. 
   I go back to my original analogy. When it was first suggested to General Motors that they might produce some smaller cars, that they might try to go after the market that Toyota was beginning to discover, there was a mantra that ran through General Motors and Ford and the big three generally, and it was: Small cars mean small profits. It was repeated over and over. 
   By repeating that mantra to themselves, these auto executives convinced themselves that the status quo was just fine, and they watched the Japanese come into this country and take market share away from them to a degree that, to some extent, threatened their existence. 
   It was only after the marketplace told them they should be focusing on the driver and what the driver wanted rather than on their own systems and what they were comfortable producing that they finally began to compete in the world marketplace for automobiles and began to produce the kinds of cars Americans wanted to drive. 
   Now American manufacturers are competitive, and we drive American cars with the understanding that they are well built, they have good fuel economy, and they give us the value for the money, an understanding that, frankly, 15 or 20 years ago, Americans did not have. 
   Why can't we have that same understanding with respect to education instead of being so overwhelmingly concerned with the system and how do we tweak the system and how do we defend the system and this is the way we teach and, by George, the students have to sit there and take it. 
   Why can't we say: What do the students need to function effectively in society? Why can't we assess the student needs, the student challenges in the future, and the student responsibilities and then say, OK, if that is what the student needs, we will provide it? If the student needs skill in the English language, to a degree that he or she does not have it now, we better figure out a way to get it to them. 
   The main problem with our school system is this: Our school system is built on the industrial model. Indeed, it was created as we went through the Industrial Revolution. Stop and think about it for a moment. 
   Our schools are factories. That is, the model on which 
   they are built is the factory model, with the student as product and the teacher as worker. Indeed, we organize the workers into unions, which is just the same thing that happens in a factory. 
   Here is the product. The product is wheeled into the English room where the English worker pours English into the product for 45 minutes. The factory whistle blows, and the product is wheeled into the math room, where the math worker pours math into the product for 45 minutes. The factory whistle blows, and the product is wheeled into the social sciences room where the social science worker pours social science into the product for 45 minutes, and so on. 
   It is organized along the industrial model, student as product, teacher as worker. 
   After the product has gone through enough class time exposures, we stamp a certificate on it, which we call a diploma, and send the product out into  the world saying: You are now educated, and the certificate we have put upon you proves it. We spend more attention to seat time than we do to the ability of the student to perform. 
   If I may digress for a moment and give you an example of how pervasive this whole mentality is from my own State, I want to talk about one of the members of our commission. We had a professor in educational psychology at Brigham Young University who was a member of the Strategic Planning Commission, which I chaired. I will not give you all of this history, except to tell you he made a commitment early in his life that he would return some day to the tiny rural community in Utah where he grew up and give something back to that community. It was an emotional kind of commitment made as a teenager when the people in that community raised enough money to send him to the University of Utah to get a college education, something he never could have afforded on his own. 
   As I say, he is a professor, graduated Ph.D. from Stanford, one of the Nation's leading authorities on small school problems. The position of superintendent of the school district in which his old hometown was located became vacant. He said to his wife: I am going to apply for that position. 
   She said: Come on, that's so far below what you do and what you are qualified for professionally. 
   He said: No, I made a commitment years ago that I would someday return to my hometown and give back to that community, and here is a way I can do it. I can go there, be the superintendent of schools, try a whole bunch of innovative things, and make a major difference. I can fulfill that age-old commitment I made as a teenager to go back to my community. 
   He applied for the position. He was told that he was not qualified for the position because there were certain gaps in his academic record that were required for that particular assignment. All right, he said, I will fill those gaps. 
   He went around to his colleagues in the School of Education at Brigham Young University and said: Give me the test. I have to have this particular class on my transcript. Even though I am a Ph.D. from Stanford, I have to have this particular class. Give me the test. I will take the test and demonstrate proficiency. 
   They said: No, no, no, no, no, no. You have to take the class. We can't give you an examination to find out whether you are proficient. You have to take the class. 
   He said: Some of these classes I teach. 
   They said: It doesn't matter. You have to sit in the classroom for the prescribed number of hours or we will not certify you as being educated. 
   He did not become the superintendent of schools in that particular rural district. This demonstrates the commitment that runs through the entire educational community, to seat time as the ultimate measure of educational ability. 
   What we are saying in this bill is, let's take a tiny, incremental, very tentative step towards looking at the needs of the student instead of focusing on the structure of the system, toward saying if somebody teaches a class, let's just assume that he knows what is in that curriculum and does not have to sit through it in order to acquire the requirements of the system. 
   Let's move from the industrial model paradigm that has the student as product and teacher as worker to a system with the student as worker--student, you are responsible for your own education--and teacher as coach. Teacher, help the worker understand where to go to get this information, to look for that skill, and so on. 
   In the process that means, ultimately, we will have a system that funds the student rather than the system. We will have a funding system where the money follows the student wherever the student, as worker, decides he or she needs to go, with the teacher, as coach, saying: You may have made a wrong decision. Look at the options. Look what you could do over there. Let me help you. Let me coach you. Let me support you. But understand, the ultimate responsibility for your education is yours, not mine. 
   That kind of a paradigm shift in thinking throughout the entire educational system would be truly a revolutionary improvement rather than the kind of changes or improvements that the Vice President has in mind when he uses those phrases. 
   I thank the Chair and the other Members of the Senate for your indulgence. As I have gone on this trip down memory lane of my own involvement with schools, I close with this one last anecdote. 
   When we were laying out, for an employee of the Utah board of education, some of the things we wanted to do and wanted to see happen in Utah's schools, he looked at me with great horror and said: We can't do that overnight. He said: Understand, we are trying to make these sorts of improvements. We are trying to make this a better situation for kids. But we can't do it overnight. You are too impatient. You come out of the business world where you can make a decision and then have it implemented. We can't do that. He said: But give us credit for moving. We will move in this direction, but we won't get there for 15 years. 
   I said to him: Now, wait a minute. Fifteen years? 
   Think of that in terms of the life of the student. That means the students who are entering this system as kindergartners, this year, will not see any improvement in their entire career because they will graduate before 15 years as seniors from high school. 
   If you think it is salutary that we can get changes moving slowly, and they will be effective in 15 years, you are just saying that a kindergartner entering school today is doomed to stay in the status quo his or her entire career through elementary and secondary education. 
   As the quotes I have read indicate, I was right. Students who entered as kindergartners, at least in the District of Columbia, are now graduating as seniors with no improvements, no changes. That is tragic. 
   To condemn a youngster as a kindergartner to no changes, no improvements, no experimentation at all, just to defend the status quo, and say, we are moving towards these changes, and they will come 15 or 20 years from now, is not something with which I want to be associated. 
   The Republican bill is not threatening. The Republican bill is not revolutionary. The Republican bill is the tiniest kind of incremental opportunity for States to experiment. We ought to pass it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator MCCONNELL's stock options legislation, S. 2323, and commend him for his hard work on this issue. This legislation allows companies who currently offer non-salaried employees a stock options program to continue to incentivize their work force without the threat of sanctions of the U.S. Department of Labor. 
   This is an easy one to support. The United States is unique in the world with regard to how our stock options and the wealth generated in our companies are shared with those who significantly participate in their creation. As in most of the rest of the world, it used to be that only our top executives received stock options from their companies. Today, many high tech companies offer stock options to all of their employees, from the clerk to the CEO. Particularly with regard to an individual's retirement needs, stock options are a tremendous financial opportunity for all workers and their families. We must do everything in our power to preserve these positive wealth- and risk-sharing developments in our economy. 
   Employees at every level should be allowed to reap the rewards of the success of their company. All throughout the United States, it has become common place for employees to quit their job and go to work for progressive companies who allow them to share in the wealth that their corporations generate. I hear repeatedly from industrial companies whose compensation structure is often very different, that they are losing their most talented and valuable employees to these new, often high-tech, corporations. And Mr. President, that kind of competition for employees benefits all Americans and it's a positive development. 
   The Department of Labor's ill-considered advisory opinion, threatened this development, and would have resulted in the cessation of often generous stock option plans for non-managerial and non-professional employees in many of America's most progressive corporations. It is critical that we recognize the importance of these wealth- and risk-sharing developments to the health of the American economy and carefully weigh each new regulation, interpretation, and law before we rashly risk the financial health and well-being of the hard-working families who have everything to do with the level of productivity our economy enjoys.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to take a step in addressing the long-term water needs of Summit County, Utah. The bill I am introducing today, to make a necessary technical correction, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District. This legislation would permit non-federal water intended for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other uses to utilize federal facilities of the original Weber Basin Project for various purposes such as storage and transportation. 
   In this case, the Smith Morehouse Dam and Reservoir was constructed by the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District in the early 1980's using local funding resources in order to create a supply of non-federal project water. However, it has been determined that there is currently a need to deliver approximately 5,000 acre feet of this non-federal Smith Morehouse water in conjunction with approximately 5,000 acre feet of federal Weber Basin project water to the Snyderville Basin area of Summit County, Utah and to Park City, Utah. 
   In 1996, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District entered into aMemorandum of Understanding and Agreement to deliver this water approximately 14 miles from Weber Basin Weber River sources within a certain time frame and dependent upon the execution of an Interlocal Agreement with Park City and Summit County. The Warren Act requires that legislation be enacted to enable the District to move ahead with this agreement with Summit County and Park City to deliver the water utilizing Weber Basin Project facilities built by the Bureau of Reclamation. 
   There is an immediate need for the delivery of water to this area. The Utah State Engineer halted the approval of new groundwater developments in the area last year. At the same time, Summit County is experiencing tremendous growth; in fact it is one of the highest growth areas in the state. Within the areas to be served, taxed by the Weber Basin District, there is a definite public need for an adequate, reliable, and cost effective water delivery project in order to meet the future demands of this area. 
   Since there is precedent allowing the wheeling of non-federal water through federal facilities, my colleagues should realize that this is a non-controversial piece of legislation. Therefore, I hope that Congress will move quickly to pass this legislation next session and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to move it quickly.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina on his honesty in that he recognizes the proposals with respect to campaign finance reform that have been on this floor are, in fact, unconstitutional. But he seeks to solve the problem with a constitutional amendment, which I think is best summarized in the comment by the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, who said this does not amend the first amendment with respect to political speech, it repeals it. 
   I don't want to vote in favor of something that could be considered by as careful a scholar as the Senator from Washington as repealing free speech for politicians. We have the same rights, I think, that everyone else should have. For that reason, I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am not happy rising in this situation because it puts me in a difficult personal conundrum. I have enormous respect for my senior colleague, Senator HATCH, who is a primary sponsor of this resolution. He has been gracious to me as a junior Senator entering this Chamber. He has supported me and guided me and counseled me in ways that are invaluable. 
   I do my very best, on every possible occasion, to stand with Senator HATCH and to support him and recognize his great wisdom, particularly in matters relating to the law. I am unburdened with a legal education, and he is one of  the better lawyers in this body, so I do what I can to listen to him and follow him. Unfortunately, on this issue, I am unable to follow him. That is why there is some personal angst in the fact that I take the floor to make this statement. 
   I am not a lawyer, but I do have an academic background as a political scientist. That was my degree in college. In that situation, I spent a good deal of time studying the Constitution, studying the circumstances surrounding its adoption, and studying particularly the Federalist Papers, which were the political tracts written at the time to try to achieve ratification of the Constitution. 
   From that study, I have come to the conclusion that this amendment to the Constitution would be a mistake. Because I have taken an oath in this Chamber to uphold and defend the Constitution to the best of my ability, and have come to the conclusion that I cannot be true to that oath, as I understand it--I cast no aspersions on those who interpret the oath differently--I will not vote for this amendment. 
   People say: What is wrong with it? It is simply enabling language. You read the language, and it is indeed relatively innocuous. Do I think it would damage or mar the Constitution in some fundamental way if it were adopted? No, I don't. So why not go along with my colleague and go along with public opinion and go ahead and put it in the Constitution? 
   Let me share with my colleagues my reasoning on this. The flag is a symbol. By itself, intrinsically, it is nothing more than a piece of cloth or several pieces of colored cloth sewn together. It has great power as a symbol because of what it represents, and we must do what we can to teach respect for that symbol among our youth and to maintain that respect as we mature. 
   The Constitution is something more than a symbol. The Constitution is our fundamental basic law. Everything we do is measured against it. If we do something in this body that does not meet that measure, it is appropriately struck down and made invalid. The Constitution is more than a symbol. 
   We are dealing here with a nonissue. No one is burning the flag in America today in any discernible numbers. No one is creating outcry throughout our populace. No one is doing anything to incite any kind of reaction over this issue. This is a nonissue that came out of the 1960s and 1970s. We are 30 years beyond the time when this was something really happening in this country. 
   If we adopt this amendment, we will be putting a symbol in the Constitution that I do not want my name attached to. The symbol will be this: We will have decided that whenever the Congress, responding to public opinion, disagrees with a Supreme Court decision, they will amend the Constitution, and they will even do it if the issue is a nonissue. The words will lie there. I think they won't make much difference one way or the other, but they will be there as a symbol of our willingness to overturn more than 200 years of tradition with respect to individual rights as outlined in the first amendment. That is a symbol of what I consider to be our foolishness to which I do not want my name attached. 
   For that reason, I am not in support of this amendment. I have taken the floor opposing this amendment on a previous occasion and so do now. 
   I will make one other comment before I sit down. I have just come from a television interview where the issue was campaign finance reform. The Vice President has just made a very long and stirring call to arms that we must somehow protect the Nation against the rising cancer of what he calls ``special interest money.'' I think the Vice President is profoundly wrong in his understanding of what happens in the campaign situation. I will save that discussion for another time. 
   The thing he did not say and that I tried to say in my television response to the Vice President was that he was ignoring the constitutional implications of what he was proposing. As I pointed out to the television audience, one of the more honest members of the Democratic Party, Senator HOLLINGS, will be on the floor in this debate to recognize that you cannot do what the Vice President wants to do with respect to campaign finance reform unless you amend the first amendment, unless you amend the Constitution. There are some who are not as honest as Senator HOLLINGS who are saying you can do it without amending the Constitution. Senator HOLLINGS will have an amendment to the Constitution. Again, I think he is 
   profoundly wrong, but he is at least honest and straightforward and open about his intentions. 
   An editorial ran in the Washington Post some years ago, speaking of myself and other Republicans, and said: If they were really serious in their opposition to campaign finance reform on constitutional grounds, they would oppose the flag amendment as well. I had already made up my mind and had already made public statement of my intention to oppose the flag amendment. I say to those who are in favor of the flag amendment but claim they want the Hollings amendment, they should adopt the same kind of consistency that the Washington Post urged upon the rest of us. If they oppose the flag amendment, they should oppose the Hollings amendment with respect to campaign finance reform as well. 
   The Hollings amendment on its history will lose. It will lose overwhelmingly because most people do not want to tinker with the first amendment. One of my colleagues said: I don't want to look back on my history as a Senator and say the most significant vote I cast the whole time I was there was one that weakened the Bill of Rights. 
   I don't either. I do not intend to vote for the Hollings amendment, and I do not intend to vote for the Hatch amendment. I think it is consistent that we stand firm to protect the liberties of the people to express their views however much we disagree with them. 
   A final footnote, if it is that: The Senator from Kentucky has shown great leadership in crafting a bill that can solve this nonexistent problem for those who insist that we must have a solution in a statutory way. It will not amend the Constitution. It will lay down a statutory marker to which all of us can repair. I urge the adoption of the statutory solution to this situation as drafted by the Senator from Kentucky and urge the Senate not to tinker with the first amendment and first amendment rights, either in the name of protecting the flag or in the name of clean elections, both of which are worthwhile goals. There are better ways to do it. In this Chamber, we can debate those ways. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has raised a very interesting question because, as I understand it, the requirement for a definition would fall to the Congress under this amendment, which means it would be decided by statute. It is the intention of the Senator from Kentucky to solve the whole problem by statute from the beginning. The constitutional amendment would end up being subject to congressional definition, as I understand it, and we would be right back where we are right now. We would have put this symbol in the Constitution and not have resolved any of the issues the Senator from Kentucky raises.  
   I think it is a very appropriate issue to be raised at this point. I can't give you a definition of what constitutes desecration of the flag.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky reminds me of a similar individual in the State of Utah who constantly berates me every time he gets the opportunity on what he considers to be a desecration of the flag, which is the addition of gold fringe to the edge of the flag. He insists that has a particular legal implication and, indeed, went to the point of insisting that if a Federal judge presides in a courtroom where the flag has gold fringe on its edge, the actions of that Federal judge are not legal and that the flag, to be properly displayed, must have no gold edge. 
   I noted on one of the rare times I have been in the Oval Office with President Clinton, the flag that hangs behind the President's desk has a gold edge on it. If indeed we were to come to the conclusion that that was a desecration of the flag and that all acts taken in the presence of a flag thus desecrated were illegal, then every bill signed by the President in the Oval Office under that definition would be illegitimate. Obviously, I don't think it will go to that point. But I think the Senator from Kentucky has made a legitimate point as to who is going to argue which position with respect to what constitutes improper handling of the flag.

   Mr. BENNETT. There is no question but that there would be pressures to move in the direction the Senator from Kentucky is talking about. I come back to my same observation, which is that if we wanted to do that, we could do it by statute. We could do it right now. We don't need to amend the Constitution in order for the Congress to pass laws with respect to appropriate flag etiquette and apply penalties to those who violate the flag etiquette. I am not sure I would vote for those kinds of laws, but we have the authority to do that. I think the statute offered by the Senator from Kentucky, of which I have the privilege and honor of being a cosponsor, moves us in the sensible direction to that extent, without leaving behind, as I say, a symbol of, in my view, overreaction in the Constitution itself.

   Mr. BENNETT. The Senator raises a very worthwhile point. It is my understanding as well that the appropriate way to destroy a flag that has outlived its usefulness, or destroy its remnants, is to burn it. That is considered an act of great respect. So it becomes a question of determining motive; and you can't simply regulate the act, you have to go into an understanding of the motive of the act, and, once again----

   Mr. BENNETT. Yes, intent. And, once again, if you are dealing with the first amendment, the first amendment is very clear that Congress shall make no law that impacts on intent; it only has to do with actual acts. If you speak against the Government, that is fine. If you enter into a conspiracy to actually overthrow the Government, it becomes an overt act, and the act is dealt with, but not your intention to demonstrate your disapproval. 
   So I think the Senator from Kentucky raises a very significant point as to how pernicious this could be if it were part of the Constitution as opposed to a statute.

   Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I have enjoyed this discussion because it is always enlightening and is the kind of discussion the American people need to hear in the present atmosphere, when there is a rush to blame all of our problems on our campaign finance system, and say: If we only reform the campaign finance system, the millennium will come. Everything will be marvelous. We will vote on Mondays. Our political system will take care of itself. There will be purity throughout all the land. 
   I come to this debate not as a lawyer but as a businessman. One of the things I learned in the business world is: Find out if it works. It is very interesting to have the theory laid out before you, but the question is, Does it work? Will the situation be as advertised before you make the purchase? 
   We have enough examples before us that I think make it clear that the current reforms being talked about--whether it is a constitutional amendment or McCain-Feingold, which I believe would be struck down as unconstitutional--do not work. Let's look at the evidence. Let's see what we have. 
   Stuart Rothenberg has a column in Roll Call, a newspaper with which all  of us on the Hill are familiar. This appeared on March 20, 1997, but it is still applicable. It is talking about campaign finance reform applied in the State of Colorado. The headline is: ``Look Before You Leap: Colorado's Lesson on Campaign Finance.'' It goes through and describes the reforms that were established in Colorado, backed by Common Cause and the League of Women Voters, setting limits on candidates and limits on contributions. To quote Rothenberg:  
   Now, however, most seasoned political operatives and many candidates will tell you privately that they think the law is terrible. They complain that the limits are too low ..... and they note that the law doesn't address independent expenditures, which will now balloon.  
   That is the point I want to make over and over again: ``independent expenditures, which will now balloon.'' 
   He goes on in the column to say:  
   So instead of making candidates more responsible for the campaign environment, the law actually encourages independent forces to become active.  
   Here is where they have tried it. They have found that special interest power has gone up, not down, and that candidates have been forced out of the equation to a great degree, while special interests have filled the vacuum. 
   He concludes his column by saying:  
   Clearly, the voters don't like the current campaign finance system, and they are eager for change. But they haven't considered the ramifications of many of the proposals, and most of the suggestions for reform have ignored the realities of political campaigns. Reformers would be well advised to start at the beginning, not at the end.  
   If I may be a little parochial for a moment, there is an editorial that appeared in the Salt Lake Tribune, my hometown newspaper, entitled ``Don't Ban Soft Money.'' The Salt Lake Tribune is not known for its friendliness to Republican candidates. But they have raised this issue, as is their first amendment right as a newspaper. They say:  
   The campaign-reform prescription of the moment is ``ban soft money.'' Beware. The cure could be worse than the disease.  
   They go on to describe all of that, and then they make the same point as Stuart Rothenberg:  
   A ban on soft money would simply encourage big donors to run issue campaigns themselves. Then a candidate's supporters could do a hatchet job on an opponent without any accountability to anyone. Some groups already are adept at this tactic.  
   I do not know if they ever met, but the Salt Lake Tribune and Stuart Rothenberg are making the same point: If you put the campaign finance reform pressure on the candidate, you increase the power of independent expenditures, you increase the power of special interest groups. 
   Here is a column by Dane Strother, a Democratic political consultant. I am trying to not just quote Republicans here. This appeared in the New York Times on February 1, 1997. He said:  
   Limiting candidates' spending usually succeeds only in giving special interests even more clout.  
   Once again, that is the same statement as these others. I will repeat it:  
   Limiting candidates' spending usually succeeds only in giving special interests even more clout. Consider recent ``reform'' efforts in Kentucky and the District of Columbia.  
   We are dealing with actual results here. We are not dealing with theory. He describes how, when he was living in the District of Columbia, campaign contributions were limited. He says:  
   In 1993, Washington limited contributions in mayoral races to $100--  
   Boy, that is draconian--  
   down from $2,000 per election cycle. Some candidates struggled mightily to raise even $30,000, and couldn't get their messages to the public. I lived in the District then, and didn't receive a single political flier or piece of mail. Some do-gooders would find this an improvement, but information is the basis of an educated vote.  
   Then here is the punch line--the same point. He said:  
   Special interests filled the vacuum. Unions and big business set up independent campaigns to help the candidates of their liking, while politicians were reduced to begging them for support. After the election, the City Council returned to the old system.  
   ``Special interests filled the vacuum''--it is the pattern that has been repeated again and again. When you put limits on the ability of a candidate to express himself, to raise the money and get his message out, you create an enormous opportunity for special interests to fill the vacuum. 
   Here is another example. This one had to do with an election in Chicago. It is written by R. Bruce Dold. He talks about the 1984 race where Charles Percy lost his seat to Paul Simon. 
   He said this was brought about, in large measure, because of a campaign run by an outsider whom he identifies as a man named Michael Goland who had no connection whatsoever to Paul Simon but who did not like Charles Percy's voting record. So he ran a series of ads. He spent more than $1 million running his ads, independent of either Percy or DURBIN, attacking Percy as a chameleon. He said, if you put pressure on the candidates, you will see far more chameleon ads. 
   He points out that in 1996, the AFL-CIO spent millions of dollars to run ``Mediscare'' ads against Republicans; and then, to balance it, he shows that the Christian Coalition and the 
   National Rifle Association tried similar maneuvers. He says, summarizing once again:  
   If these groups want to express a political opinion, more power to them. But McCain-Feingold would make them more powerful than the candidates themselves.  
   That is another example, another place. You go to Colorado, you go to Utah, you go to Washington, DC, you go to Chicago--everywhere it is tried, it is demonstrated again and again, the more pressure you put on the candidates in the name of campaign finance reform, the more you give to the special interest groups who then, in the words of one of the columnists there, fill the vacuum. 
   I have more that I would like to say, but I see my colleague from Washington is here, and I want to close so we can hear from him. 
   I simply want to commend to the Members of the Senate an article reprinted from the University of West Los Angeles Law Review written by James Bopp, Jr., and Richard E. Coleson, in which I think they summarize it all in the title of their article. The title is: ``The First Amendment Is Not A Loophole.'' I cannot think of a better summary of this entire debate than that title of this article by these lawyers in this law review: ``The First Amendment Is Not A Loophole.'' Then they add the subhead: ``Protecting Free Expression In The Election Campaign Context.'' 
   I may come back to this article at a later point in the debate. But as I say, now I wish to wind up so we can hear from the Senator from Washington. I cannot think of a better summary than that of this title, and I leave it at that: ``The First Amendment Is Not A Loophole.''

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to add another point to the points I made earlier when I said that holding down the ability of candidates to express themselves in terms of the amount of money they can raise and the amount of advertising they can do only creates an opportunity for special interests to fill the vacuum. There is one other point I need to make with respect to the perceptions on this issue. The first perception, which I have attacked, is that holding down the expenditures and the contributions will somehow control the special interests. I am sure the results of where it has been tried has been in the opposite direction. 
   The special interest rule now through campaign contributions --I want to share this with the Senate. A survey was done in Fortune magazine, published in December of 1999, byline, Jeffrey Birnbaum, who, again, is not normally known for his sympathy of the positions of this Senator, he talks about the impact of money on politics in Washington in this article. Fortune magazine does an annual survey of who has the most clout in Washington, which special interests are the most powerful. 
   For 3 years running now--and in this article it is the same one--the No. 1 special interest that has the most power in Washington, rated by those who have done the survey, is--the envelope please--the AARP, which is a group that, by its rules, does not give any campaign contributions to anyone. The group that is considered the most powerful special interest in Washington by this independent survey is a group that does not give campaign contributions, hard or soft. 
   One of the individuals involved in pulling together the survey, a man from the Mellman Group--Mark Mellman is his 
   name--he is one of the  pollsters. He normally polls on the Democratic side of the aisle. I think my Democratic colleagues might recognize his name. He made this comment, ``We couldn't find any direct relationship between campaign donations and clout.'' 
   I think that is worth repeating in this superheated atmosphere about how campaign contributions are ``buying'' the Congress. Here is an outsider coming in to do a survey of the most powerful special interest groups in Washington and how they got their power, and he says: ``We couldn't find any direct relationship between campaign donations and clout.'' 
   The question arises: if their clout does not come from the campaign contributions, why does the AARP have so much power? It is because they have so many members. It is voters who make the difference. 
   What is the group in second place behind the AARP. It is the National Federation of Independent Businessmen. Why do they have so much power? Because they have so many members. It is voters who make the difference. 
   I am sure that no one would want to say to the AARP, in the name of campaign finance reform, we are going to forbid you to tell your members what you think about how people vote in Washington. Are we going to say to the NFIB we are going to forbid you to talk to your own members in the name of campaign finance reform? Those are the groups that are 1 and 2 in this independent survey. 
   You can go through the whole thing and you will begin to realize that all of the conversation about contributions and power in Washington is conversation that takes place in the press gallery. In the reality of where we compete in the election process, it misses the mark. 
   I remember during the hearings someone said: Senator, with this process you are allowing people to buy access to you. I responded then as I respond now: The best way for you to get access to me is to register to vote in the State of Utah. If you are a voter in the State of Utah, I will do my best to get access to you, greet you, sign autographs, make you feel good about me. It will not cost you anything, particularly if you live in Utah. If you don't live in Utah, it would be a little hard to register there. So I think there are some myths that need to be dispelled. 
   The final one I want to address has to do with this question of the amount of money that is flowing and is being raised. I am quoting now from a paper presented by Professor Joel Gora from the Brooklyn Law School, another Democrat, a man who was heavily involved in Senator Eugene McCarthy's insurgent campaign for the Presidency in 1968. He makes this point:  
   Senator McCarthy's landmark and principled 1968 Presidential campaign raised more money, adjusted for inflation, than George W. Bush's campaign this year .....  
   I didn't hear anybody complaining in 1968 that Eugene McCarthy was a tool of special interests bought with special interest money. He raised more money, adjusted for inflation, than George W. Bush has raised this year. And Professor Gora goes on to say:  
   ..... and did so relying on an extremely small handful of extremely wealthy individuals who shared the ideals and values of Senator McCarthy and his supporters. Only in the perverted post-Watergate world of campaign ``reform'' would the word ``corruption'' or ``the appearance of corruption'' possibly be used to describe that noble endeavor.  
   I didn't support Eugene McCarthy in 1968, but I agree that nobody would have said that Eugene McCarthy in 1968 was a tool of special interests or that he was part of corruption or the appearance of corruption? Why? He disclosed every dollar immediately when it was received, and everybody knew who his supporters were and why they were with him. They were with him because they opposed the war in Vietnam. 
   There is much more that can be said, and undoubtedly will be said, but I want to leave it at that. A number of myths are swirling around this whole debate. We need to look at the reality, which is that every time campaign finance reform has been tried at the State level, the power of special interest groups have gone up, not down, as a result. The reality of it is that we do not have an inordinate amount of money washing through politics today. If you take it on an inflation-adjusted basis, it is the same today as it was back in 1968. We do have a great deal of hysteria which, if we don't puncture the balloon of that hysteria, could lead us to make a seriously significant mistake. 
   I don't want us to do that. That is why I am as vigorous as I can be to see to it that we do not pass the Hollings amendment and we do not, subsequent to that, pass McCain-Feingold. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins commemorating the 2002 Salt Lake Olympic Winter Games. 
   The first modern Winter Olympic Games were held in Chamonix, France in 1924. Since then, the Winter Olympics has been held every four years to recognize outstanding accomplishments of athletes throughout the world. Salt Lake City, Utah is proud to be hosting the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, the first Olympic Winter Games of the new Millennium. 
   While it is a great honor for us to host the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, our state will have a tremendous financial burden placed upon us. The proceeds from these commemorative coins are greatly needed to help us support these events and train future Olympic athletes. I would like to stress that minting these commemorative coins will have no net cost to the Federal Government, and that the proceeds will be distributed equally to the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic Winter Games of 2002 and the United States Olympic Committee. 
   Mr. President, this is the smallest Olympic coin program ever, containing  only two coins. Additionally, the program has been developed in consultation with the Mint and the numismatic community to address concerns over previous commemorative coin programs. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am very supportive of the conference agreement provisions which allow exemptions to the current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. I commend Chairman MCCAIN and leadership on creating a process which I believe fairly balances the interests of Senators from States inside the perimeter and those of us from western States without convenient access to Reagan National. 
   I have been involved and supportive of the effort to open up Reagan National since the legislation was first introduced. While I would have preferred to eliminate the perimeter rule altogether or have more slots available for improved access to the West, the final agreement includes 12 slots. I want to reiterate that these limited exemptions must benefit citizens throughout the West. Having said that, this same limited number of exemptions must not be awarded solely or disproportionately to one carrier or one airport. I expect that the DOT will ensure that the maximum number of cities benefit from these 12 slots. I am particularly concerned that small and mid-size communities in the West, especially in the northern tier have improved access through hubs like Salt Lake City. 
   These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule from hubs like Salt Lake City will improve service to the Nation's capital for dozens of western cities beyond the perimeter--while ensuring that cities inside the perimeter are not adversely impacted by new service. This is a fair balance which is consistent with the overall intent of the bill to improve air service to small and medium-sized cities. 
   Throughout this bill, the goal has been to improve air service for communities which have not experienced the benefits of deregulation to the extent of larger markets. The provision relating to improve access to Reagan National Airport is no different. Today, passengers from many communities in the West are forced to double or even triple connect to fly to Reagan National. My goal is to ensure that not just large city point-to-point service will benefit, but that passengers from all points west of the perimeter will have better options to reach Washington, DC, via Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. This provisions is about using this restricted exemption process to spread improved access throughout the West--not to limit the benefits to a few large cities which already have a variety of options. 
   Let me be clear, according to the language contained in this provision, if  the Secretary receives more applications for additional slots than the bill allows, DOT must prioritize the applications based on quantifying the domestic network benefits. Therefore, DOT must consider and ward these limited opportunities to western hubs which connect the largest number of cities to the national air transportation network. In a perfect world, we would not have to make these types of choices and could defer to the marketplace. This certainly would be my preference. However, Congress has limited the number of choices thereby requiring the establishment of a process which will ensure that the maximum number of cities benefit from this change in policy. 
   Again, Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman and his colleagues for their efforts to open the perimeter rule and improve access and competition to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. As a part of my statement I would like to include in the RECORD a letter sent to Chairman MCCAIN on this matter signed by seven western Senators.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today, the 28th of February, is the 150th anniversary of the founding of the University of Utah. We look back with nostalgia but also look forward with great excitement at the future of that particular university. 
   It is a university to which I am attached both in personal life and by legacy. Both of my parents graduated from the University of Utah. My two brothers and two sisters attended the University of Utah. I graduated from the University of Utah. My wife attended the University of Utah. We are a Utah family. 
   The university started on the 28th of February, 1850. For those who understand Utah history, they will realize that the State, at least to the degree it is now, began on the 24th of July, 1847. So for those who founded the State, to focus on the creation of the University of Deseret, as they then called it, so quickly after they arrived in Salt Lake Valley is a testimony to their vision and their determination to make higher education a very key part of their lives.  
   At that time, there was no infrastructure in the community. There were barely farmhouses and farms that had been created. The first classes of the University of Deseret were held in private homes. 
   The university has come a long way since that time. It is now recognized as one of the premier universities in the United States in a number of areas. The one that they are perhaps best known for is in medicine. The University of Utah is the site of the first artificial heart. It has been the site of other medical breakthroughs. It is currently the home of the Huntsman Cancer Center--a $100 million gift from the Huntsman family to fight cancer in the United States. The Huntsman family decided that the medical school at the University of Utah was sufficiently in the forefront that it would be the place they would have the Huntsman Cancer Center. 
   One other interesting thing that goes back to the founding of the University of Deseret that I think we need to recognize with respect to what the University of Utah is and can do in the future is its physical proximity to the genealogical records that are maintained by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
   A few months ago, I had a medical researcher come into my office in Salt Lake City, a man who by virtue of his credentials could have gone virtually anywhere in the world, to tell me how excited he was to be at the University of Utah. 
   His specialty, an area of greatest medical concern, is dealing with the disease of diabetes. He went on to point out to me how diabetes many times is the disease that then causes other diseases. He said, statistically people may die from something other than diabetes but, in fact, it was the diabetes in the first instance that caused them to get whatever it was to which they were recorded as having succumbed. 
   He said: The reason I am excited about being at the University of Utah is that the records available in the family history library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints make it possible for researchers at the University of Utah to trace the family history of people with this particular disease in a way no other body of data can. It is a unique experience to be here where you have that kind of link. 
   Of course, when the University of Deseret was founded, it was founded with the full support and, indeed, almost sole support of the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. So it is appropriate even now, as the university has become a State institution, certainly separate from the church and any of its hierarchy, that there is still the kind of intellectual synergy that can come out of the proximity of the university and the work the church is doing in another area. 
   The University of Utah stands as the flagship research school in my State and, if I may be parochial a little, perhaps for a large part of the West. There are many things done at the University of Utah that radiate beyond our State borders, not only in medicine but in other fields as well. We have a first-class law school to go with the medical school. We give Ph.D. degrees in a wide variety of subjects. The University of Utah is proud to have been in this business for 150 years. I am proud, as a Utah man, to stand on the floor of the Senate and pay tribute to the university and to those farsighted individuals who founded it 150 years ago today.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I said, I have two items to commemorate. That is the first one, an item of some nostalgia looking forward. The second one actually is tomorrow, but I will take advantage of being here now to talk about something that comes to an end tomorrow. 
   The Presiding Officer was intimately involved, as he served as a member of the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, a committee that officially goes out of existence tomorrow. There were many who said, when the committee was formed: There is nothing so permanent as a temporary government program. You will find an excuse somehow, some way, to keep this committee alive for years. 
   It is with some pride I point out that we are not doing that. The committee was organized to deal with the year 2000 technology problem. The committee dealt with the problem. The committee was scheduled to go out of existence on February 29, when presumably the problem would be behind us. The problem is behind us, and the committee will disband as of tomorrow. 
   I pay tribute to the vice chairman of the committee, CHRISTOPHER DODD, the Senator from Connecticut. As chairman of the committee, I could not ask for a better partner. I could not ask for a more cooperative or dedicated partner in working on this particular problem. We acknowledge the other members of the committee, starting with the distinguished occupant of the Chair, Senator KYL from Arizona; Senator MOYNIHAN from New York; Senator SMITH from Oregon; Senator EDWARDS from North Carolina, who was preceded on the committee by Senator BINGAMAN from New Mexico; Senator LUGAR from Indiana, who was preceded on the committee by the junior Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS; 
   and then, of course, the two ex officio members of the committee who attended committee hearings, paid attention to the committee activities, and contributed significantly to it, that is, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD. 
   There are many people who say: Well, you really didn't have a problem, did you? You formed this committee, and then, look, nothing happened with respect to Y2K. 
   It reminds me a little of the story attributed to Bob Hope, who said: You know, I really don't appreciate the way the Army treats me when I go out on these USO tours over the holidays. At Christmas, I go all around the world to put on shows for the GIs. They tell me I am going into dangerous parts of the world, so they use me as a pin cushion; they fill me full of shots before I go. It is a complete waste of time because I have never gotten sick once in any of these places. 
   I think that can be said to a certain extent with respect to the Y2K problem. Many people are saying: Gee, you wasted all our time and money. Look, nothing happened. 
   The record is fairly clear that had we, as a Nation, not focused on this issue and dealt with it, we would have had very significant problems. 
   When the committee was formed, I set one goal, among others, which I believe we very much met and I feel very proud about having achieved. As we looked out over the Nation and, indeed, the world with respect to the Y2K problem, the one thing that was clear was that no one knew the extent of the problem. No one knew how it was going to play out, and there was no place one could go to get that information. So I challenged the staff as well as the members of the committee. 
   I said: If we do nothing else in this committee, we will become the repository of accurate information about Y2K. All over the world, people will know that if they want to find the best source of where things are with respect to Y2K, they will want to come to the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem. 
   I believe we met that challenge. I believe by the last few months of Y2K, it was recognized virtually around the world that the Senate reports on Y2K were the most authoritative, the most complete, and ultimately the most dependable. 
   A lot of people don't realize we were saying in those last few months: There will not be a Y2K problem in the United States. I used to say that in speeches, and I would have people challenge me: How can you say that? Sometimes they would quote my own earlier speeches back to me because early on I was raising the alarm and predicting significant problems. I was predicting those problems on the basis of the information then available. But as the committee fulfilled its function and became the repository of accurate information, committee spokesmen and women would stand and say again and again: We are probably not going to have any serious problems in the United States. 
   Then people said to us: Well, why did you miss it overseas? There weren't serious problems overseas? 
   I have two observations on that. First, we did not have the same degree of accurate information about situations overseas that we had in the United States. We were unable to reach the same level in dealing with information that came from outside the country as we did from information within the country. Second, we had more problems overseas than the press has reported. There were many people who were simply embarrassed about their Y2K problem and didn't talk about it. Indeed, we had some examples before the committee of problems that did exist and were later denied simply because of the embarrassment people would feel if they admitted they had had difficulties. 
   The ultimate question is: Was it worth it? Did we, in fact, make a contribution worth the amount of money we spent to staff this committee? I say without any hesitation, yes, it was very much worth it. We are seeing benefits over and above the contribution the committee made to alleviating the problem. 
   John Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense, has publicly stated: If it were not for the process we went through to deal with Y2K in the Defense Department, we would have had serious Y2K problems and we would not have the information we now have. 
   In responding to the pressure from Y2K, the Defense Department, for the first time in its history, now has an inventory of all of their computer systems together with a ranking as to which of those systems are mission critical and which are not. One might think in a straight management assignment the Defense Department would have that information anyway. They did not have it before we caused them, in an effort to respond to the inquiries from the committee, to go through the process of gathering it. 
   Alan Greenspan has been quoted as saying that in American industry at large, the effect of the Y2K remediation activity has caused American business men and women to understand  their vulnerability and dependability on computers in a way they never understood before and that the investment of bringing everything up to the highest possible level is an investment that will pay significant financial dividends for the economy in the years ahead. 
   So as I look back on those activities and those accomplishments, I express satisfaction for the work of the committee, a degree of satisfaction for whatever contribution I may have been able to make as its chairman but ultimately enormous gratitude to the members of the committee and to the members of the staff. 
   When Senator DODD and I were appointed, respectively, as vice chairman and chairman of this group, we made the determination we would not have a partisan staff. While it was partisan in the formal sense that there was a minority director and so on, it was housed in the same facility; the members of the staff were majority or minority and worked together on a daily basis. We had a number of detailees from a variety of agencies who came to us and brought a level of professional expertise we could never have achieved in any other way. We maintained throughout the entire exercise a determination to get the job done that was not interfered with by any attempt at staff bickering or posturing for any partisan purposes. 
   I pay tribute to Senator DODD for his willingness to join me and, indeed, for his leadership in pushing me in that direction, and to the people whom he appointed as minority members of the staff. I also pay tribute to the administration and John Koskinen, who held the position on behalf of the President. There, also, there was no partisanship and no posturing for any partisan advantage. 
   For the sake of the record, I want to read into the RECORD the names of the staffers who helped us with this accomplishment. They are: Robert Cresanti, staff director. Before being staff director, he worked with me on the Banking Committee to raise the initial alarm with respect to this possibility. T.M. Wilke Green, appointed by Senator DODD as minority staff director; John B. Stephenson, who came from the GAO, the deputy staff director. Then we had Thomas Bello, professional staff; Tania Calhoun, committee counsel; James P. Dailey, professional staff; Paul Hunter, professional staff--these people were absolutely magnificent in the degree of expertise and professionalism they brought to us--Unice Lieberman, minority press secretary; Sara Jane MacKay, legislative correspondent; Don Meyer, press secretary; J. Paul Nicholas, professional staff; Frank Reilly, professional staff; Noelle Busk Ringel, our archivist. The clerk was Amber Sechrist, who came out of my office in a very professional and solid way. We also had Ronald Spear, professional staff, and Deborah Steward, GPO representative. 
   To all of these men and women, I pay tribute and extend my warmest thanks and gratitude for the work they have done. Tomorrow, off the presses will come ``Y2K Aftermath--Crisis Averted, Final Committee Report.'' With the issuance of this report, the committee no longer exists. But as Secretary Hamre, Chairman Greenspan, and others have said, the benefits of the committee will live on over and above whatever benefits we had for averting the crisis. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. I thank the chairman of the committee. 
   I rise with my fellow members of the committee to express my delight at this particular piece of legislation and the fact that we have come to where we are. 
   I take note of the work of Geoff Gray, Linda Lord, Wayne Abernathy, and other members of the committee staff who have provided such tremendous support for this. They have been available not only to the chairman but to members of the committee as well in a way that has been tremendously helpful. I make that acknowledgment of their contribution. 
   I will focus for just a moment on the issues of privacy. Most of the other issues relating to this bill have already been aired and discussed. I don't need to add to that. But I have paid a lot of attention to the whole privacy issue for the last 3 1/2 , 4 years, primarily because of my interest in medical confidentiality. I am the prime sponsor of the bill relating to confidentiality of medical records and, frankly, have had quite an education in the whole privacy area as a result of that. 
   We are in a new world. That has become a cliche but, as with most cliches, it happens to be true. We are in a new world now where information is available at a level and a quantity that has never been the case before. Those who complain about this and want to go back to the anonymity of the pre-electronic age are wishing for something that is simply not going to happen. Those who call themselves ``privacy advocates,'' who have attacked certain portions of this bill, are wishing for a world that is long gone. 
   The only question now with respect to the information that is available to us is not will it be available but, rather, how will it be responsibly used. One of the things that many of the privacy advocates ignore is the reality of the marketplace. Having been a businessman prior to coming to the Congress, I want to talk about that for a minute. The privacy advocates think Government must intervene on behalf of the consumers against rapacious businesses that would somehow use the information available to them in a way to do damage to those consumers. I suppose there are some businesses that might be so foolish as to do that, but the vast majority of businesses recognize that the only way they survive is on repeat business, and the only way they get repeat business is to keep their customers happy. 
   I remember, during the hearings, Congressman MARKEY raised some specters and gave us examples of abuses that banks had made of credit card information of some of their customers. I made the comment there, and I will repeat it here: If a bank did to me what Congressman MARKEY accused a bank of doing to one of its customers, I would change banks. I can solve the problem on my own very quickly. I don't need the Government to step in in that situation to protect me. 
   Furthermore, the bankers I deal with, such as the retailers and others that want to sell me something, are very anxious not to offend me. They are very anxious to keep me happy. So if they start using this information that they have, as a result of the information age, in a way to service my needs better, they are going to keep me happy. If Government interferes with their ability to do that, Government will get in the way. On the other hand, if they--that is, the banks--use this information in a way I don't like, they jeopardize our relationship, and they jeopardize my business. 
   We must understand here in the Congress that customers are not the captives of the business and banking organizations that depend upon them for revenue. Customers are the reason for their existence, and customers, consequently, truly are king. That is another cliche that a lot of people who haven't been in business don't understand, but it is true. The customer is king. If you do anything that violates your trust with the customer, you are going to pay for it, and you are going to pay for it in real dollars. 
   So I believe the balance that has been struck in this bill to provide the right amount of privacy protection is the correct balance, and I think we must take some time and see how it works out in the real world of real commerce before we panic and say we must pass further Federal regulations. 
   With that, I record my approval of the work of the chairman and the ranking member with respect to the conference and all of the difficulties connected therewith, and say this is a historic day that we are finally reaching after many, many years of wrangling on this subject. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee in a colloquy on the ability of insurance companies to make investments that are treated as ``financial in nature'' under this legislation even though the investments are made in companies that are not engaged in financial activities. 
   Am I correct that overlap between board members and officers of a financial holding company and a portfolio company in which an insurance company has an investment is not intended to result necessarily in a determination that the holding company routinely manages or operates the portfolio company? Or to state this intention another way, the existence of routine holding company management or operation is to be based upon an assessment of actual holding company involvement in day-to-day management and operations of the portfolio company, rather than board member or officer overlaps.

    Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to take a step in addressing the long-term water needs of Summit County, Utah. The bill I am introducing today authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into contracts with the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District. This legislation would permit non-federal water intended for domestic, municipal, industrial, and other uses to utilize federal facilities of the original Weber Basin Project for various purposes such as storage and transportation. 
   In this case, the Smith Morehouse Dam and Reservoir was constructed by the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District in the early 1980's using local funding resources in order to create a supply of non-federal project water. However, it has been determined that there is currently a need to deliver approximately 5,000 acre feet of this non-federal Smith Morehouse water in conjunction with approximately 5,000 acre feet of federal Weber Basin project water to the Snyderville Basin area of Summit County, Utah and to Park City, Utah. 
   In 1996, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District entered into a Memorandum of Understanding and Agreement to deliver this water approximately 14 miles from Weber Basin Weber River sources within a certain time frame and dependent upon the execution of an Interlocal Agreement with Park City and Summit County. The Warren Act requires that legislation be enacted to enable the District to move ahead with this agreement with Summit County and Park City to deliver the water utilizing built Weber Basin Project facilities built by the Bureau of Reclamation. 
   There is an immediate need for the delivery of water to this area. The Utah State Engineer halted the approval of new groundwater developments in the area last year. At the same time, Summit county is experiencing tremendous growth; in fact it is one of the highest growth areas in the state. The areas to be served are within the area taxed by the Weber Basin District, and there is a definite need for a public entity to build a project to supply an adequate, reliable, and cost effective water delivery project to meet the future demands of this area. 
   Since there is precedent allowing the wheeling of non-federal water through federal facilities, my colleagues should realize that this is a non-controversial piece of legislation. Therefore, I hope that Congress will move quickly to pass this legislation next session and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on the Energy Committee to move it quickly.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was in New York on Monday to hold a hearing of the Y2K Committee when Senator MOYNIHAN, a member of that committee, joined me. I greeted him with the normal good humor that we greet one of our colleagues, but he did not respond in good humor. Instead, he said to me: I have very sad news. I was a little surprised at that and asked him what was so significant as to cause him to be so downcast. He said: John Chafee died. That was very sad news, indeed. 
   I was stunned, along with my colleague from New York, and had to reflect on how recently I had seen John Chafee, spoken with him, found him in good spirits, if not in good health. Indeed, I thought he was in good health. 
   On Friday of last week, I was addressing a group of students from the State of Utah answering their questions about the Senate and Senate procedure and Senate life and was interested when I got a question that I often get from people outside of the political arena. It was: Tell us about life as a Senator. And specifically this question was: Tell us about the Senators. Then the questioner said: Tell us who your friends are. 
   That is always an interesting question. You want to be careful about the answer because you do not want to offend anyone by leaving them out. But I said to that group on Friday: I have many friends in the Senate, but one of my closest friends is John Chafee. 
   I put those two incidents over the weekend together. On Friday, I am citing the name of John Chafee as one of my closest friends, and on Monday, one of my other friends in this body tells me of John's passing. 
   I have waited until now to take the floor to pay tribute to John Chafee, partly because of the press of business and partly because I was afraid I could not keep my composure. Those who know me well know my emotions sometimes run very close to the surface. I get dewy-eyed at the dedication of a parking lot. 
   For that reason, an occasion such as this one can be a difficult one. At the same time, however, I want to look at the death of John Chafee from a slightly different perspective. 
   We mourn his passing. We become emotional at the thought of his loss. But we should recognize in many ways this is a time for rejoicing. 
   I have had the experience, along with many others, of dealing with aging parents. My father was 95, my mother 96, when they passed away--neither one of them in good health. 
   My mother dealt with an aging parent in her lifetime, a father who had a stroke and then lingered for a number of years thereafter. Mother used to say to us: If I'm killed in an automobile accident, rejoice. I don't look forward to going through old age. 
   When people retire, very often they go downhill rapidly. John showed no signs of that, but his health was failing. He had been in the hospital for a back problem. He was not an old man by my standards. Seventy-seven seems increasingly younger as I get closer to it myself. But I think of the possibility of John Chafee running downhill in old age. I think we might rejoice that he was spared that. 
   John Chafee left at the top of his game, at the top of his form. He was a Senator's Senator. He was involved in everything. We did not vote together very often, but when we did, he was always grateful; and when we did not, he was always understanding. I never had an occasion where John Chafee was disapproving. 
   We stood together on one issue where we were two of four Republicans--one of the occasions where we crossed the line; John did that more often than I--to join with a group of Democrats. That was the flag amendment. John and I both had great reverence for the flag of the United States, but we felt our reverence for the Constitution outweighed that and that the Constitution should not be amended to deal with a nonexistent problem because flag burning is no longer going on in the United States, except by those who want to goad us into attempting to amend the Constitution. At least that is the way I saw it and that is the way John saw it. He was always friendly and supportive when we had those kinds of problems. 
   The thing I will remember the most about John Chafee, as a Senator's Senator, was the way he would go after problems and not people, the way he would tackle challenges and not the challengers, the way he would maintain a constant good humor, even in the face of difficulties within his own party or difficulties from across the aisle. 
   It is a time for rejoicing, rejoicing because we had the privilege of dealing with this man, right up to the end of his life, and then seeing him spared the long good-bye that we are seeing in others--Ronald Reagan, for example. I think if John Chafee were given the choice, he would take the choice the Good Lord has given him rather than lingering on in some crippled fashion. He had a weak heart, weaker than any of us knew. The possibility of that kind of situation was perhaps there, but I am following the advice of my mother, who, looking at the possibility of an old age, said: If I'm taken suddenly, don't mourn. Rejoice. 
   There is very little I think we can add to the accomplishments of John Chafee's life. We can rejoice that we knew him, served with him, and we were with him right up to the moment where he left, as I say, at the top of his game. 
   I extend my deepest sympathies and condolences to his family. I have met both his wife and his son. I know what fine people they are. I know how desperately they feel this loss.

   Mr. BENNETT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will begin debate on the African trade bill at 9:30 a.m. Following 30 minutes of debate, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the Roth substitute amendment to the trade bill. Therefore, the first vote will occur at approximately 10 a.m. 
   If cloture is not invoked on the trade bill, it is the majority leader's intention to move on to other legislative items. This trade bill has been the pending business for 1 week, as of tomorrow's date. One week is precious time when the end of a congressional session is near. The majority leader will, of course, notify the minority leader as to the next legislative item that he intends to bring up. 
   The Senate may also begin consideration of the conference report to accompany the D.C./Labor-HHS bill, with the vote anticipated early next week.

   Mr. BENNETT. Let me ask a question, which I will be asking my friends on the other side as well. But since my colleague has raised it, I think he could be an expert on this issue. 
   Since we are being told repeatedly throughout this debate that the huge amounts of soft money are corrupting and controlling the votes, let me ask the Senator from Idaho, who is a member of the Republican leadership: If the AFL-CIO were to simply give that $49 million to the Republicans and thus corrupt and influence our votes, would that not be a better investment on their part than to have it wasted on people who are already with them?

But I want to go back to the argument that has been made again and again by my friend from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona, that the tremendous amount of money that is being put into the system influences how people vote. If I were sitting on a $49 million pot of money, advising the AFL-CIO, saying what you want is to get more of your legislation through the Congress, I would say to them: If in fact the $49 million does change the way people vote, why not give the $49 million to the people who are not voting for us? Why not give the $49 million to the Republicans and turn them all into rabid supporters of the AFL-CIO?

   Let me ask the Senator from Idaho, if he was to suddenly receive in his campaign--through, let us say, the State party of Idaho, because it cannot be given to him directly, there is no way the soft money can corrupt you because you cannot receive it--but, if the AFL-CIO were suddenly to give to the Republican Party of Idaho $1 million in cash, would you change 
   your position on any of the labor issues you have discussed, paycheck protection, for example?

   Mr. BENNETT. When I was on the committee with the Senator, we were debating this issue. I said the best way to get access to me is to be registered to vote in the State of Utah. Then I asked the Senator from Michigan, is that the same thing for himself--that he pays more attention to constituents from Michigan than he does to contributors who come from outside the State.

   Mr. BENNETT. I will confess, this whole question of the appearance of corruption bothers me a very great deal. I do not know that the drafters of the first amendment talked about the appearance of free speech or the appearance of a vigorous political debate. So I ask the Senator this question. 
   Hypothetically, if the Senator from Michigan were to meet with the head of the United Auto Workers on a Monday, in advance of casting a vote on the union's position on the following Tuesday, and vote in favor of the union's position within 24 hours of that meeting, and then on the following Wednesday, within another 24 hours, the union made a very large soft money contribution to the Democratic National Committee--in the opinion of the Senator from Michigan, A, would that be the appearance of corruption; and, B, would that be something he would seek to ban in the name of appearance of corruption?

   Mr. BENNETT. Let us assume the Senator from Michigan did not solicit; that the solicitation came from the Senator from New Jersey in his position--changing it, therefore, from the Democratic National Committee to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the solicitation came from the Senator from New Jersey in his posture as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

   Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am interested and pleased to hear the Senator say he does not agree with those polled who say money buys votes and that the individual Members of the Senate are not corrupt. 
   My question to the Senator, since he is a teacher by profession is, if that perception in the public is not true, why shouldn't this teacher spend his time trying to educate the public as to what is true rather than to fall in with the sentiment expressed in the poll which is inaccurate?

   My question to the Senator is, again, if he disagrees with the position stated in the poll, even though it is held by 92 
   percent of the respondents to that poll, inasmuch as he is a skilled, trained, and professional teacher, would he not spend his time well using his skills as a teacher educating these people in his State, as I have tried to do with the people in my State, rather than simply going along with them and saying if that is your position, I will follow it legislatively even though I disagree with it? Would that not be a better use of the Senator's obvious teaching skills?

   Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity. I have been following this debate and, indeed, have been involved in it with great interest ever since it began. 
   While I appreciate and, indeed, salute the sincerity with which the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin pursue their efforts to achieve what they sincerely believe will be good for our country, I must begin by stating that I am absolutely convinced that what they are pursuing would be bad for our country, would be bad for our political system, would be bad for campaigns in general, and would raise, rather than lower, the sense of frustration and disgust with the political system overall. 
   That has been the history of campaign finance reform. It has gone on in this town for decades. Every time, the reformers end up making things worse. I say that with all respect for the sincerity with which they pursue their goal. But, in my opinion, the goal they are pursuing is not available to them through the route they are following. 
   I wish to begin by quoting a column that appeared last week in the Washington Post written by Robert Samuelson. Robert 
   Samuelson is not known as one of the more partisan of the political commentators. He is basically considered an objective commentator,  spending more of his time on economics than other issues. But what he has to say about this issue captures what I believe about it so well that I am going to quote him at some length. 
   He says:  
   Few subjects inspire more intellectual conformity than ``campaign finance reform.'' All ``right-thinking'' people ``know'' that election spending is ``out of control,'' that the present system of campaign finance is corrupt and that only reactionaries block ``reform.''  
   I think that captures exactly what we have been hearing on the floor--that all ``right-thinking'' people ``know'' that election spending is out of control and the present system is corrupt and only reactionaries block ``reform''. 
   Then he goes on:  
   Who cares if these common beliefs are either wrong or wildly exaggerated--or that most ``reforms'' would do more damage to democracy than any harm they might cure? The case against ``reform'' is almost impossible to make, because people's minds are closed.  
   That beginning of Mr. Samuelson's column, as I say, perfectly captures how I feel about this issue. Here is the history--again, in previous debates, I have gone through the history at some length. Mr. Samuelson summarized well:  
   The history of ``campaign finance reform'' is that every limit inspires new evasions. One possibility is that interest groups will finance more independent campaigns ..... to elect or defeat targeted candidates. ``Reformers'' view such ``issue ads'' ..... as shams. And so, the next step would be to curb such advertising, even if curbs flout the First Amendment.  
   Mr. Samuelson then goes on with this very insightful quote from one of the reform groups that summarizes how this debate has crystallized:  
   ``Any effort to reform issue advocacy spending in connection with federal elections must strike a regulatory balance between protecting political speech and protecting the integrity of our electoral process,'' says one reform group.  
   Well, as Mr. Samuelson says:  
   The First Amendment says that ``Congress shall make no law ..... abridging the freedom of speech.'' There's no mention [in the First Amendment] of ``regulatory balance.'' And if elections and ``issue ads'' aren't about political speech, what are they about? ``Right thinking'' people minimize the conflict between ``campaign finance reform'' and free speech, because it is inconvenient.  
   Then Mr. Samuelson summarizes, and I think, again, this is the ultimate summary of the debate:  
   As long as we have the First Amendment, the effort to regulate elections--under the guise of ``campaign finance reform''--is futile, self-defeating, and undesirable. The hysteria about money's corrupting power worsens the very problem that reformers claim to deplore: public cynicism. But right-thinking people are oblivious to evidence or logic. They are at ease with their own respectable conformity.  
   I could not have done it better, so I didn't try. That is why I quoted it at that length. Let's go to the debate for a minute. By the way, I ask that I be informed when I have 5 minutes left.

   Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, took the floor a day or two ago to give us a glimpse of the real world that we are facing if certain portions of this bill go forward. He was arguing that we should not pass the substitute, commonly known as Shays-Meehan, because he said it will limit the speech of political parties and leave us to the mercies of special interest groups. I wrote down some of the things he said. 
   He said, ``The debate will be fought by surrogates over our heads in a far larger context.'' I agree with that absolutely. If political parties are limited in the amount of soft money advocacy in which they can be involved but special interest groups are not, special interest groups will simply ignore the political party by the ads themselves. 
   Mr. TORRICELLI laid out for us in great detail some of the stratagems that would be followed, thus validating the comments Robert Samuelson made about political money finding another way around, finding a new way to come into the arena. That is the real world we will face, and the junior Senator from New Jersey was exactly right in outlining how it will work. Yet we seem to go plowing ahead on the assumption that somehow the real world will be different if we just show how honest and anxious we are to appear not to be corrupt. 
   Let me give you some real-world examples. We have heard that from other Members of the Senate. People have talked about their own elections. I want to talk about several real-world examples from elections in which I have participated. 
   Let's go back to the 1998 election when I got reelected. My opponent complained about this very issue. He complained often and he complained as loudly as he could that somehow there is something broken about the system because, he said: I can't raise enough money to compete with Senator BENNETT. What is the matter with a system where ordinary people can't compete? 
   We pointed out to him in one of the debates that on the ticket with him was a sixth-grade schoolteacher running for Congress who raised more money than her incumbent opponent. What is the difference? The candidate for the Senate can't raise enough money, he says, to compete with me, whereas another Democrat in the same State, a sixth-grade schoolteacher, can raise enough money to compete against a sitting Congressman. 
   My opponent, by the way, according to his financial disclosure, is a millionaire. The sixth-grade schoolteacher clearly is not. The sixth-grade schoolteacher clearly depends upon her paycheck very heavily. The difference was not because of my personality or his personality. The difference was that the people who are involved in providing money for political races make a very cold calculation as to what your chances are. 
   When I first ran for the Senate, and I came to this town, and I did the circuit of all of these terrible places we have been hearing about on this floor asking them for money, they did not ask me what I believed. They didn't ask me, what will our access be if we give you money? They didn't say to me, gee, we want to know your positions before we decide. They wanted to know if I had a chance of winning because, they said: We don't back losing horses. And they were convinced I was a losing horse, and they didn't give me any. I went out of this town empty-handed. 
   I was outspent 3 to 1, with my opponent in a primary in the State of Utah spending $6.2 million. That sets a record on a per vote cast that I don't think has ever been broken. I was able to put my message across with a third of that amount, and I beat him, at which point people started to say: All right, now we will talk to you, because now that you have won the Republican nomination, it looks as if you may have an opportunity. 
   The problem my opponent had had nothing to do with his positions, had nothing to do with his own bank account, had nothing to do with his own personality. It was simply that he 
   was perceived as a loser and the people who were giving money decided they didn't want to back a loser. 
   But here comes a sixth-grade schoolteacher with no money in the bank and no political experience of any kind, and they thought she might be a winner, so she got all the money she needed. She didn't win. One of the reasons she didn't win is very appropriate to this debate. She signed the term limit pledge; her opponent did not. 
   So Americans for Term Limits--or whatever they are called--came into that congressional district with a whole series of issue ads attacking her opponent, attacking him for his failure to sign the term limit ad. This is a special interest group with soft money. We have no idea where it came from. We have no idea in what amounts it was raised. We have no idea who signed on because they are not under the FEC. But they exercised their constitutional right. They came into the Second Congressional District in the State of Utah, and they flooded the airwaves with some of the nastiest, most vicious political ads I have ever seen attacking the incumbent Congressman. 
   What happened? Early polls showed that the sixth-grade schoolteacher was going to beat the incumbent Congressman. She had more money than he did. She had momentum. Then these ads started to run, and the reaction on the part of the voters in the second district--I heard it everywhere I went campaigning--was: We hate those ads. How can Lily Eskelson be so vicious as to run those ads? 
   She then went on the air, and she said: I am not running them. I don't  have anything to do with them. This is a special interest group. All I did was sign the term limit pledge, and Congressman COOK didn't. 
   Congressman COOK went on the air and said: I am the victim of a smear campaign. And in the minds of many voters, it was Lily Eskelson who was doing the smearing. She had absolutely no control over the ads. If she had, she would have pulled them. But she didn't. It was the special interest group that was exercising its constitutional right, and there was nothing she could do about it. 
   Congressman COOK appropriately protested: How can you attack me for violating term limits when I am running for my first reelection? He had only been in Congress one term. They were attacking him for being part of the system and not signing the term limit pledge that would have given him three terms. He said: Don't come after me until I have served at least the three terms you think are appropriate. 
   I think the special interest ads in the second district had a significant impact on the outcome of that election. 
   I point this out. Here is a sixth-grade schoolteacher with no money who is able to outspend and outfundraise her opponent because those who put up the money thought she has a chance to win. That is the criterion, nothing else. She lost the race because a special interest group came in and flooded the district with their ads, thinking they were helping her but were in fact hurting her. 
   If we say that political parties cannot defend themselves against these special interest ads, we will do exactly the thing about which the Senator from New Jersey talked. We will create a situation where the candidates become unimportant, and the special interest, in the words of the Senator from New Jersey, ``fight over our heads in a far larger context.''

   Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair. 
   This is the real world. The real world is a world in which attempts to get around the first amendment and attempts to find ways to regulate political speech backfire against the reformers, and they do not work. 
   One last description out of the real world. We have heard a lot on this floor this afternoon about access. All right, maybe we are not corrupt. We had that debate earlier last week whether or not we are all corrupt. So now we are being told, well, no, we are not corrupt. At least we have made that clear--not to Maureen Dowd, but to a lot of other people we are at least not corrupt. But we are somehow tainted by virtue of the fact that we can't control this access, and access becomes the issue rather than corruption. 
   As I said once before, the easiest way to get access to me is to be a voter registered in the State of Utah. I will take your call, and I will have you come into my office. But my opponent in this last election raised this issue of access in this context. As it so happens, he has been lobbying me for the entire time I have been in the Senate about a program of which he is in favor. He successfully lobbied me. I agree with him on their program. It is microcredit. I have done everything I can as a member of the Appropriations Committee to increase the appropriations for microcredit. And, frankly, I have been successful. All I did during the campaign was ask him this one question: Every time you came to see me to try to lobby on behalf of microcredit, did anyone in my office ever ask you if you had made a political contribution to Senator BENNETT? 
   He immediately said: No, no one ever asked me that question. 
   I said: Then why do you stand here and claim that access is for sale when you, now my opponent in this race, have had full access to my office for the entire 6 years I've been here? 
   It boils down to those who are corrupt will be corrupt regardless of the system; those who are not corrupt will not be corrupt regardless of the system. 
   For those who say we are now far worse than we ever were, I offer two last comments. No. 1, when I moved into the Dirksen Building, I noticed there was a safe in every Senator's office. My father was here when the Dirksen Building was built. Let me state why there is a safe in every office--for the Senators to put the cash they receive in their offices from people who come to see them. That doesn't mean they are corrupt. My father was not corrupt. But I watched him receive an envelope full of cash in his office in the Dirksen Building, and I watched him open the safe and put it in there. It happened, by the way, to have come from one of the senior Senators on the Democratic side of the aisle who said, ``I don't want any other Republican to be the ranking member of my committee; I want you to win, Wallace, and I raised this money for you.'' 
   It was $5,000, which in those days was in excess of 5 percent of the total cost of a campaign. Dad put it in his safe in the Dirksen Building. When my office was renovated recently in the Dirksen Building, what did I do? I took the safe out because I have never used it, and I don't think any other Senators ever use it. We don't get offered cash in our offices anymore. 
   Second, David McCullough wrote the biography of whom many considered the most incorruptible President we have ever had, Harry Truman. In his biography of Harry Truman, David McCullough reports that the highest paid individual on Harry Truman's staff was Bess Truman, who lived in Missouri and never came to Washington or entered the Senator's office. Why was she his highest paid staff member? Because Senators routinely did that in order to be able to live on their salaries. 
   According to Mr. McCullough, Harry Truman was terrified the people of Missouri would find out he was paying Bess the highest permissible salary so he and Bess could handle the financial challenges of serving in the Senate. Was Harry Truman corrupt? No. Even in a corrupt system, and I am sure there are Senators who were, he was not a corrupt man. There may have been an appearance but the appearance did not mean the reality. 
   They changed the system. We are now paid a living wage. We don't do that anymore. We don't put our relatives on the payroll and have them not show up. But let Members not sit here and say the system is far worse now than it ever used to be. Politics in America is as clean as it has ever been and far cleaner than it used to be. Let's not do what Robert Samuelson warns against: In the name of campaign finance reform make things worse again. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding for a question, and I precede the question with a comment that I think the Senator from New Jersey is doing us a very worthwhile service in pointing out the reality of the world in which we would live if soft money were banned for political parties but not for 
   everybody else. I agree with the Senator from New Jersey, absolutely in his words, when he says the debate would be fought by surrogates which would take place over our heads, a far larger context. 
   I ask the Senator to give us his opinion of what would happen if Shays-Meehan, which he is endorsing, were to pass and then the Supreme Court were to strike down as unconstitutional the ban on issue ads by outside groups? Would that not, in fact, then leave us with the situation which the Senator from New Jersey is decrying, I think appropriately, as a bad system?

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I can ask a further question of the Senator from New Jersey, if he is aware--I know he is aware because he is a very astute student of politics but maybe not aware enough to comment without further research--if he is aware of what has happened in the State of California where they have virtually unlimited initiative opportunities and virtually every truly contentious political issue is now decided by initiative rather than by the legislature and the amount of money that is spent in an initiative fight dwarfs any of the sums we are talking about here. 
   In the State of California, when an initiative fight comes up over an issue, which traditionally would be handled by the State legislature, the special interests on both sides of that fight routinely go over the hundreds of millions of dollars on both sides of the fight which dwarf the amount of money spent for a senatorial or gubernatorial race in that State. 
   I ask if the Senator is aware of some of those particulars and if he will comment on the implications of that on a national basis if we get to the point where issues are fought out by special interest groups with unlimited budgets being spent on both sides, the implications on the role of the legislature in its constitutional responsibility to control the legislative agenda.

<DOCNO>106-bennett-ut-5-19991015</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BENNETT. If I may, then, could I enlighten the Senator from New Jersey on the case of Arnold Hyatt. This comes from an article that appeared in Fortune magazine on September 7, 1998, in an article entitled ``The Money Chase,'' the subtitle of which says: It's as venal as this: The Presidential candidates who raise the most money get the nomination. Fortune's guide to the masters of the political universe. 
   Now, in that article, it describes Arnold Hyatt, 71, who, in 1996, was the second largest individual contributor to the Democratic Party. His $500,000 gift was second only to the $600,000 given by Loral's Bernard Schwartz. 
   The article goes on to say: Hyatt wrote his $500,000 check a month before the November 1996 election, specifically to help unseat vulnerable House Republicans and return the House to Democratic control. 
   I am sure the Senator from New Jersey would accept that as a laudable goal. The Senator from Utah might argue with that, but that was his purpose. In the article it says he has decided not to give any more soft money. Quoting the article, why he decided to stop contributing to politicians so soon after giving so much, he admits that it was because his Democrats didn't win. 
   Then, the article goes on:  
   He still aspires to topple his enemies by ending the Republican majority in Congress. Hyatt then hasn't gotten religion, he's changed tactics. Rather than relying on the Democrats to press his agenda, he is now giving heavily to organizations like the Washington-based Public Campaign, which lobbied for publicly financed elections.  
   I submit to the Senator from New Jersey that what he says will go on and, in fact, is already going on, as demonstrated in the case of Mr. Hyatt who gave one-half million dollars--enough to put him on the chart of the Senator from Wisconsin all by himself,  without any company behind him, his own money, one-half million dollars. Clearly, it had to be soft money because if it were hard money, it would be illegal and over the $25,000 limit. He decided to shift that giving from a party--because he wasn't getting the results he was hoping for--to a special interest group. 
   That is why I asked if the Senator was aware of him because, in my view, he represents a class A example of exactly what the Senator from New Jersey is saying will happen. It has already started to happen and will continue to happen if we pass the underlying legislation. 
   I thank the Senator.

In the conference report, the Secretary of Defense in conjunction with the Surgeons General is to establish a process to select medical research projects.

   Mr. BENNETT. I am holding a copy of the web site in which the Senator from Arizona is quoted as follows:  
   In the last several years, while Republicans controlled Congress, special interest earmarks in appropriations bills have dramatically increased. The rise in pork barrel spending is directly related to the rise of soft money, as Republicans and Democrats scramble to reward major donors to our campaigns.  
   Immediately adjacent to that statement, as an example which ``will give you an idea of what laced this most recent trichinosis attack,'' again a direct quote from the web site:  
   ..... $2.2 million for sewer infrastructure needs associated with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Utah.  
   I plead guilty. I am the Senator who approached the Appropriations Committee to ask for that earmark. 
   I ask the Senator from Arizona if he can identify for me from the words he has used in the web site, ``the rise of soft money'' that came to me that caused me to approach the Appropriations Committee to ask for that money; specifically, I am going to ask the Senator from Arizona to identify the source of the money, the amount of the money, the recipient of the money that produced that which he describes on his web site as a direct result of, presumably, the money that was received.

   The accusation is made on the web site ``It's YOUR Country.com'': ``The rise in pork barrel spending is directly related to the rise of soft money.'' And one example of that is the $2.2 million appropriation for sewer and infrastructure associated with the Winter Olympics. 
   My question to the Senator from Arizona was--and remains--not, is the appropriation for the Olympics appropriate or not? My question for the Senator from Arizona is, who gave the soft money? How much was it? And where did it go that resulted in my actions being taken? 
   Now, let me point out that it is possible to answer those questions with respect to corruption. I sat as a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee that examined what happened in the 1996 election. 
   I will give you three examples that I want to apply to this context. Then if the Senator from Arizona will give me an answer, I will yield to him for an answer to my question. 
   Example No. 1: Who gave the money? is the question. The answer is: Roger Tamraz, a fugitive from justice from many countries in the world. 
   Second question: How much? $300,000. 
   Third question: To whom? The Democratic National Committee. 
   Fourth question: What did he get for it? The answer is he got invited to the White House, a dinner with the President and a conversation with the President, that which is facetiously referred to as ``face time,'' despite the fact that the National Security Council told the White House that Roger Tamraz should not be allowed in the White House because of his background. 
   There are the four elements: Who gave the money? How much was it? Where did it go? And what was the quid pro quo? All four are identifiable. I would be willing to say that constitutes corruption. 
   Roger Tamraz gave $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee to earn entry into the White House and ``face time'' with the President, in spite of the warning by the National Security Council that he should not do that. 
   Example No. 2. The Riady family. Who gave the money? The Riady family. They were the largest single contributor to the Clinton campaign in the 1992 election. How much? I don't have that total. It was in the millions. To whom was it given? Soft money. It went to the Democratic National Committee. 
   What was the quid pro quo? The quid pro quo was the placing of John Huang in the Commerce Department where he could become, in the words of the Riadys--of James Riady--``My man in the U.S. Government.'' 
   There are the four elements: Who gave the money? The Riadys. How much was it? In the millions. Where did it go? The Democratic National Committee. And what did they get? An appointment of their individual buried inside the administration. 
   No. 3, not quite as clear, but nonetheless the four elements are there. The Indian tribe that was approached by the Democratic National Committee, an Indian tribe that was one of the most impoverished in the United States. 
   What did they want? They wanted the return of what they considered to be ancestral lands. They were told, if they gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic National Committee, they would receive the lands that had been taken away from them decades prior. They raised the money. 
   Where did the money come from? It came from the Indian tribes. How much was it? It was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Where did it go? It went to the Democratic National Committee. What did they get for it? In fact, they got nothing because the administration was unable to return the lands. That was the case of a scam, in my opinion, that is corrupt. 
   So I come back to this question to the Senator from Arizona, or anyone else who can answer it: With respect to the $2 million that was appropriated for sewer infrastructure in Utah, I want to know, who gave the money? How much was it? Where did it go? And where was the quid pro quo that I delivered on? 
   I am unaware of any money that was given by anybody in any amounts that influenced my action here. But I have been accused on a web site, for the entire world to see, of caving into soft money. I have been accused of being corrupt. I have been accused of doing something in this body solely because--and I quote--``The rise in pork barrel spending is directly related to the rise of soft money.'' 
   As I say, I will engage in a debate over the wisdom of Federal support for the Olympics in another time and in another venue. The issue has nothing to do with that question. The issue is whether or not a Member of the Senate, when he is accused of corruption, has a right to know the details of the corruption; whether a Member of the Senate has the right to know, when his young people are told by one of his colleagues that he is corrupt and, therefore, the young people in his State may be discouraged from running for public office or may feel ill about the system, because they are told their Senator is corrupt, he has the right to know the details of that corruption accusation. I believe that is a fundamental right of every Member of this body. 
   I am asking the Senator from Arizona to answer those questions: Who gave the money? How much was it? Where did it go? How did it affect my actions with respect to the Appropriations Committee? 
   I am prepared to yield to the Senator from Arizona for an answer to that, if he wants to do it now, or I will give him a chance to research it, if he prefers. It has nothing to do, in my view, with Elizabeth Drew or with actions within the Appropriations Committee so much as it has to do with the accusation that has been made about me personally, to which I take personal offense.

   Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to respond. If I were convinced the legislation before us would achieve the result that is claimed for it, I would vote for it happily. My concern with the legislation before us is that it, in fact, would make things worse rather than better. We can discuss that and those details at an appropriate point in the debate. 
   I don't want to dodge it because I think the point the Senator from New York is making is a legitimate one, and his logic is, indeed, inexorable. The one hole I see in it is his assumption that this bill before us would work. My conviction, after reading it carefully, is that it not only would not work but would do serious damage to our first amendment rights. 
   I come back to the fundamental question we are dealing with in terms of the spirit of this debate and the spirit in which it is cast. This debate is being cast in the national press and over the Internet and, indeed, in the Presidential campaign as a debate between the incorrupt and the corrupt. I have been labeled as being on the side of the corrupt, and I don't like it. 
   If I am, I want to be identified in such a way that makes it clear that I am, instead of in a broad brush kind of way. One of the things we all try to avoid is tarring people with broad brushes. This is not a broad brush. This is a specific charge that then is drawn over into the broad brush of ``we are all corrupt.'' I want to know from whom did the money come, how much was it, and to what organization did it go that caused me to take the action I took. 
   In the absence of being able to produce those statistics, I think the charge that I am corrupt should be withdrawn. That is what I am saying. That is what I am going to continue to say as a matter of personal privilege until we get this thing resolved. It has nothing whatever to do with the merits or demerits of funding for the Olympics on the Federal level. It is a question of my position, of personal integrity, that, in my view, has been impugned on a web site available to the entire country.

   The Senator is the chairman of the Ethics Committee, and I see the other member of the Ethics Committee leadership on the floor in the form of Senator REID. I ask, is this process, as it is being practiced and handled, virtually on a routine basis, violative of the rules of the Senate?

I wrote to the Senator from Arizona and told him I was going to raise this on the floor because I did not want him to be blindsided by it. I wanted to be as courteous as possible. But in my letter to the Senator from Arizona, I told him I was disturbed, indeed offended, by this and intended to raise it. Therefore, I have kept my word to the Senator from Arizona. 
   My question still goes to the response that I have had which is that the appearance of corruption comes from appropriations that are unauthorized. I want my friend to address this directly because he has been the outspoken advocate of this appearance of corruption question.

I make no attempt to hide this. I plead guilty as having been the Senator who approached the Appropriations Committee in request of this particular item. 
   It has been raised here that by virtue of the fact that I did that on an item for which there was not a previous appropriation, that in and of itself is an appearance of corruption, and I am asking the Senator if he agrees with that characterization.

There has been no contribution identified from anyone connected with this in any form. Does the Senator not agree, therefore, that the appearance of corruption here would be pretty low?

   Mr. BENNETT. My only response to my chairman, when I served as a member of his committee, we talked about Roger Tamraz, the Riadys, and the Indian tribes not being illegal. It has the appearance of impropriety. I think it is only not illegal in the opinion of the current Attorney General. I think there are others for whom it clearly would be considered illegal and that indictments might be brought. The current Attorney General has decided in her wisdom that it is not illegal. 
   I want to be clearly on record as disagreeing with her on that and believing that indictments should have been brought and that this is, in fact, a violation of existing law. Being unburdened with a legal education, I think perhaps I can make that kind of comment without having to back it up. Nonetheless, it is my opinion with respect to her opinion on these particular cases.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there has been some uncertainty in my state about the continuation of Star School grants. For my colleagues who are not familiar with Star Schools, it is a grant program that has helped distance learning move forward in many parts of the country. The beneficiaries in my state include many students in the San Juan school district, a small, rural, and remote school district in southeastern Utah. Many Star School grants have been awarded to the winners of a competition. Often these grants are multi-year grants. Some recipients are fearful about losing funding for the continuation of their grants if new projects are funded. Is it the intent of the chairman that continuing grants will receive a high priority in funding allocations?

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the actions taken by the Commerce Committee and in particular, Chairman MCCAIN, in crafting provisions that will allow exemptions to the current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Mr. Chairman, I commend you on creating a process which I believe fairly balances the interests of Senators from states inside the perimeter and those of us from western states without convenient access to Reagan National. 
   These limited exemptions to the perimeter rule will improve service to the nation's capital for dozens of western cities beyond the perimeter--while ensuring that cities inside the perimeter are not adversely impacted by new service. This is a fair balance which is consistent with the overall intent of the bill to improve air service to small and medium-sized cities. 
   Throughout this bill, our goal has been to improve air service for communities which have not experienced the benefits of deregulation to the extent of larger markets. The provision relating to improved access to Reagan National Airport is no different. Today, passengers from many communities in the West are forced to double or even triple connect to fly to Reagan National. My goal is to ensure that not just large city point-to-point service will benefit, but that passengers from all points west of the perimeter will have better options to reach Washington, DC via Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. This provision is about using this restricted exemption process to spread improved access throughout the West--not to limit the benefits to a few large cities which already have a variety of options. 
   Let me be clear, according to the language contained in this provision, if the Secretary receives more applications for additional slots than the bill allows, DOT must prioritize the applications based on quantifying the domestic network benefits. Therefore, DOT must consider and award these limited opportunities to western hubs which connect the largest number of cities to the national air transportation network. In a perfect world, we would not have to make these types of choices and could defer to the marketplace. This certainly would be my preference. However, Congress has limited the number of choices thereby requiring the establishment of a process which will ensure that the maximum number of cities benefit from this change in policy.

    Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was sad to learn of the death of Mrs. Eva Israelsen of North Logan, Utah this past week. As one of Cache Valley's oldest living residents, she was a remarkable woman. 
   Eva May Butler Israelsen was born October 5, 1894, in Butlerville, Utah. She attended Butlerville School as a young girl. A diligent student throughout her life, she was Valedictorian of the first graduating class of Jordan High School in 1915. I find it remarkable that just nine years ago, she and the other surviving class member, Thomas J. Parmley celebrated their 75th class reunion. In 1991 she was invited to be the featured speaker at Jordan High School's graduation. 
   She attended the Utah Agricultural College (now Utah State University) where she met her husband Victor Eugene Israelsen. They were married in the Salt Lake LDS Temple in 1917. After college, she and her husband farmed, eventually establishing the North Logan Buttercup Dairy where she lived for 63 years. That dairy became a landmark in Cache Valley. 
   Eva was known throughout Cache Valley simply as ``Grandma Israelsen.'' She kept numerous journals and granted countless interviews to young people in the community who sought her out for her perspective and historical knowledge. She remained active in her community and her church throughout her life. With support from her children, she attended nearly every funeral, wedding and baby blessing in the community. She was active in the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers and blessed the lives of her neighbors through her charitable example and her Christian life. 
   Grandma Israelsen had a remarkable memory, often recalling details about not only her own family members and grandchildren but of the families of her neighbors and acquaintances. It was common for her to ask her neighbors about their children by name, even though she may not have seen them for years. The residents of North Logan will miss that, just as they miss waiving to her on her morning walks which she used to take back when she was a young woman of just 101. 
   She and her husband had eleven children, eight of which are living. Her husband Victor passed away in 1967. Her progeny includes 67 grandchildren, 271 great-grandchildren and 40 great-great grandchildren. Including the 97 spouses, she is survived by 483 family members. 
   Grandma Israelsen would have been 105 years old today. So on her birthday, I want to pay tribute to her life and express my condolences to her family on her passing. She was a remarkable woman who led a remarkable life. Sophocles once said ``One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been.'' In her passing, I am sure that the community agrees that it was indeed splendid to spend the day with Eva Israelsen.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am somewhat unfamiliar with the assignment of handling judicial nominees, that being the daily bread of my senior colleague, Senator HATCH. He is unable to be here, and therefore has asked me to step in in his place. I am glad to do whatever I can to help. 
   Ted Stewart has a background that, in my view, qualifies him to be a Federal judge, a view shared by the American Bar Association that has labeled him as qualified, and by a large number of Utahans of both political parties. 
   I first met Ted Stewart when I decided to run for the Senate. I found that he had beat me in that decision and was already in the field. I knew little or nothing about him. But I quickly learned as we went through the process of traveling the State in tandem with the other candidates that he was a man of great wisdom, an articulate man, and a man of good humor. We became fast friends even though we were opponents for the same seat. 
   One of the proudest moments in my campaign was the fact that after the State convention had narrowed the candidates to two, eliminating Ted Stewart, his organization became part of my organization. He maintained an appropriate judicial neutrality between me and the other candidate. But our friendship was established and has gone forward until this day. 
   I point out that judicial neutrality because it is typical of Ted Stewart. I know he had a personal preference. I will not disclose what it was. He was appropriately judicial, however, in keeping that personal preference to himself and taking the position that was right and proper under those circumstances. That demonstrates what we hear referred to around here from time to time as ``judicial temperament.'' 
   The Senator from Alabama has talked about the reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit. We have had experience with the reversal rates in the State of Utah from Federal judges. 
   I remember on one occasion where I was in the presence of a young woman who had served on a jury of a highly celebrated case in the State of Utah and had voted in a way that was reversed when the case got to the circuit court. I asked her about it because it was interesting to me. She said: Well, I didn't want to vote that way, and neither did any other member of the jury, but the charge we received from the judge made it impossible for us to vote any other way. 
   After the trial was over, she said she and the other members of the jury were visiting with the lawyer who had supported the losing side, and they apologized to him for voting against him. They said: We thought you had the best case. But under the charge we were given by the judge, we had no choice but to vote against you. The lawyer smiled, and said: I know. And I expected that to happen because the judge in this case has such a high record of reversal that I didn't want to run the risk of having won a trial in his court. I knew my chances of winning on appeal were far greater if I had this judge on record against me. 
   Those who know this judge rated him as one of the most brilliant men ever appointed to the bench. He may have had that great intellect, but he did not have the common sense and the judicial temperament that made it possible for him to do his job. Tragically, the circuit court did his job for him again and again and again at great expense and inconvenience not only to the judicial system but to those plaintiffs and defendants who came before him. 
   I cite that because I am convinced in Judge Stewart's court you will not find that kind of bullheadedness and determination to have his own way as we saw in this other court. 
   In Judge Stewart's court, you will find the kind of levelheadedness, the desire to find the right answer, and the  willingness to work things out wherever possible as he has demonstrated throughout his career up to this point. 
   He has already had experience on a commission that required him to demonstrate that kind of judicial temperament. He handled his assignment there in such a way as to win him the endorsement of Democrats as well as Republicans. 
   I know there is some controversy surrounding him because he is the Governor's chief of staff. There are many people who, looking at the things he has done in his loyalty to the Governor, have said: Well, his opinions are not acceptable to us. 
   They have been critical of him. They do not know the man if they maintain that criticism because he will never depart from his conviction that the law comes first. He has demonstrated loyalty to those who have appointed him. But he has also demonstrated a capacity to handle the law and handle the regulations that he is charged with enforcing in a way that will make all Americans proud. 
   I am happy to join my senior colleague in endorsing the nomination of Ted Stewart for the Federal bench. I look forward with great enthusiasm to voting for him tomorrow. 
   I am grateful to the senior Senator from Vermont for his announcement that he, too, will vote for Ted Stewart. I hope, with both the chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee solidly in Judge Stewart's behalf, that we will have an overwhelmingly positive vote for him.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today which authorizes the creation of the Golden Spike/Crossroads of the West National Heritage Area in Ogden, Utah. 
   Utah has a rich railroad heritage that stems from the earliest days when the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads met at Promontory Point, Utah in 1869 and completed the transcontinental railroad. With the coming of the railroad, Utah's mining industry boomed and our economy grew and the once isolated Desert Kingdom became forever connected to the rest of the United States. Diverse peoples and cultures would come to or through Utah. Mormon immigrants from Europe, Chinese laborers working for the Central Pacific Railroad and Greek coal miners on their way to the coal fields in Central Utah. All of them would pass through the rail station in Ogden on their way to settle the Intermountain West. It truly is a heritage area for us all. 
   Fire destroyed the original rail station first built in 1889. In 1924 the current Union Station Depot was then built and remained the hub of transcontinental rail traffic for another 40 years. The current building, which is a registered historic site, has been refurbished and is an outstanding example of reuse and redevelopment of industrial areas. The facilities at Union Station also house some of the finest museum collections in the West including the Browning Firearms Museum and the Utah State Railroad Museum. 
   It is the intent of this legislation to preserve the historical nature of the area, increase public awareness and appreciation for the pivotal role Ogden played in the settlement of the Intermountain West. By general standards, this will be a very small Heritage Area, encompassing just a few city blocks around the Union Station building. While it may be small, it also has a very colorful history. There were no businesses which were more famous, or infamous than those that dotted 24th and 25th Streets. 
   The legislation would allow Ogden City to operate as the management entity for the area, working in closely with the National Park Service. The City will be responsible for developing a management plan which will present comprehensive recommendations for the conservation and management of the area while the National Park Service will work closely with the partners to help with interpretation and the protection of this valuable cultural and historical resource. Working with railroad enthusiasts from all over the country we can develop a long-term management plan which will provide better interpretation of the historical and cultural opportunities.  
   I hope my colleagues will support me in sponsoring this legislation. Congressman HANSEN has introduced similar legislation and I look forward to working with him and my friends on the Energy Committee to hold hearings and eventually move this bill through the Senate.

    Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am introducing two bills which address minor technical issues in Washington County, Utah. Given the non-controversial nature of these bills, I am hopeful they will be given quick consideration. 
   The first bill deals with a land exchange between the city of St. George and the BLM to facilitate a Washington County, Utah habitat conservation plan for the desert tortoise. The parcel of land at issue was once used as a landfill. The BLM is interested in acquiring the land in an exchange, but it is reluctant to accept liability for any unknown toxic materials that may be in the landfill. The bill would leave liability for the landfill in the hands of the city. Both the BLM and the city of St. George are in favor of this legislation. 
   The next bill deals with an exchange between the State of Utah and a private party. This exchange would facilitate additional protection for the endangered desert tortoise. The parcels of land that the State wants to trade were given to them pursuant to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act and consequently have a BLM reversionary clause clouding title to the property. This bill would remove those reversionary clauses so that the State could pass clear title in the land exchange. 
   I appreciate once again the leadership of Chairman HANSEN on the House Committee on Resources in taking the lead on these bills in the other body and I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Energy Committee to move these bills quickly.

   Mr. BENNETT. I want to bring to the Chairman's attention an issue that we would hope to address this year. In Garfield County, Utah, we have what is called the Boulder to Bullfrog Highway which goes from the tiny town of Boulder to the Bullfrog Basin Marina at Lake Powell. This road crosses some of the most rugged, scenic and roadless country in the southwest. Headed eastbound, a traveler will cross the Grand  Staircase Excalante National Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, additional BLM lands and on into the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. It is county-maintained road with a right-of-way crossing federal lands. 
   Sections of the road are classified as both improved and unimproved meaning that sections are paved in some places and are gravel or dirt in others. Despite this, it is heavily traveled by tourist and locals because it is the only east-west road for 60 miles north or south. During the spring and summer, flash floods often will wash out the road forcing its closure. This occurs most often near the Bullfrog Creek drainage, where it is not unusual to have a 100 yard section of the road washed out. When this happens, a detour of over 150 miles is required just to get to the other side of Capitol Reef National Park which would otherwise be roughly a 30 mile drive. 
   Clearly, there is an public interest in keeping the road open, yet every summer the County and the National Park Service expend considerable capital and manpower to keep the road open after every rain. This situation could be alleviated by placing a series of culverts or other type of structures over the Bullfrog Creek drainage to keep the road from washing out. 
   With this in mind, I ask the Chairman if he believes it would it be appropriate to provide Garfield County, Utah approximately $500,000 from the Federal Lands Highway account to install a structure to keep the road open throughout the year?

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues and I have advocated a small increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I also want to commend Senator COCHRAN's efforts to increase funds for the National for the Humanities. Neither endowment has received a significant increase since their budgets were cut by nearly 40 percent in fiscal 1996. I believe a $4 million increase is warranted given the reforms intended to make the endowments more efficient and more accountable have been implemented and we have seen results. 
   While a positive story could be told about the National Endowment for the Arts, I believe the real story of the NEA and NEH is a local story. And in my case, a Utah story. In previous years, I have outlined the origins of the strong arts and humanities tradition in Utah. The arts flourished in Utah before Utah was even a state. Utah also had one of the first publicly funded arts councils in America. 
   Today, I would like to tell two stories of traveling exhibition programs in the arts and humanities. Both benefit rural areas. Both provide communities with opportunities that might not be available otherwise. These types of programs make a strong case for a small federal investment in the arts and humanities. 
   For the last 35 years, the Utah Arts Council's Traveling Exhibition Program, supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, has toured visual arts exhibitions all over Utah. In some areas, particularly in the more rural regions of the state, the exhibition is the only source of visual arts programming. Utah's San Juan county bussed children from surrounding communities to view these exhibitions. Another rural county boasted a 100-percent citizen participation for one of the exhibits. 
   The Utah Arts Council's Traveling Exhibition Program serves more than 150,000 people in all but two counties of the state each year. Every year the Utah Arts Council receives more than 250 requests for the program, but is only able to satisfy half. Each Traveling Exhibition includes educational materials that emphasize not only the artistic aspects of the exhibits, but also its connections to other aspects of the curriculum. 
   Denise Hoffman, a librarian at the Green River Library and participant in the program, made this comment:  
   We are a very small and isolated town in rural Utah. Almost every student in the grade school comes to the library on a weekly basis. A vast majority of our students will never be exposed to the arts. We use the traveling exhibitions as a basis for learning. By making these displays easily affordable, you cannot count the young lives that have been touched, or guided into the arts. Please consider dollar for dollar what we are getting with this program. It is critical to us.  
   Another program that benefits rural areas is a collaborative project between the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services (SITES)  and state humanities councils. Its goal is to give small rural museums access to Smithsonian resources. What resulted was a small traveling program with Smithsonian type exhibits called ``Museum on Main Street.'' The two projects developed under this program are ``Produce for Victory: Posters on the American Homefront 1941-1945'' and ``Barn Again! Celebrating an American Icon.'' The Utah Humanities Council spearheaded this effort and the following communities have participated in this program: Castle Dale, population 1,704; Vernal, population 6,644; Kanab, population 3,289; Wellsville, population 2,206; Monticello, population 1,806; Delta population 2,998; Ephraim, population 3,363; 
   Heber, population 4,362; and Payson, population 9,510. 
   Castle Dale, Kanab, Payson, Vernal, and Delta hosted their first Smithsonian exhibit using ``Produce for Victory'' as a basis for the communities to remember what was occurring in America during the years 1941 through 1945. Each community developed local programs including USO dances, ration recipe luncheons, reunions of women who worked in munitions industries (``Rosie the Riveter''), discussions of the 1930s and 1940s movies and newsreels, and exhibitions of local artifacts. 
   Kanab had activities all year commemorating World War II. Events included a poster exhibit from the Smithsonian, World War II movies from Brigham Young University's film collection, and countless other very personal contributions from many of the town's people who had directly participated in the war or were relatives of those who had. 
   An immediate result of various groups working together on this project was to make young people aware of those whose lives were directly touched by World War II. Many of the local youth had no idea that they were living next door to people who had first-hand knowledge of this historic event. Grandchildren were talking to grandparents and asking questions about the war. Many teens were surprised to learn that some of those serving in the armed services were no older than their big brothers or themselves. During the celebration, those who had contributed their possessions from that period stood by their displays, ready to describe each artifact. 
   These types of activities help us remember our history, the individual sacrifices that were made for freedom, how individuals coped with difficult times, and how America emerged stronger. Understanding this legacy through these types of exhibits is a worthwhile pursuit. 
   The traveling exhibits that I have described today are in keeping with the goal of bringing our historical and cultural heritage to areas that would not otherwise have the opportunity. Much of the criticism of the NEA has been anecdotal and has painted an ugly picture. Utah's story is anything but. The state arts and humanities councils, assisted by the National Endowments, and the Smithsonian, has demonstrated how arts and humanities can be a positive influence in our communities. 
   Mr. President, I believe a continued federal arts and humanities partnership is worthwhile, and encourage my colleagues to support a small increase. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman GORTON for his leadership on this bill. He has had to balance several competing priorities and has done an admirable job. I appreciate very much his attention to the details of so many important issues.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I want to raise an issue that was recently brought to my attention in Utah. It is a long-term project that I intend to undertake and I hope that the committee will support me in this effort. 
   The Utah Museum of Natural History contains collections of more than one million objects and specimens in the fields of geology, biology and anthropology. It ranks as one of the largest and most comprehensive collections for the western states. Overall, more than 75 percent of the museum's collections are federally owned; that is, recovered from federally managed public lands. Of the remaining 25 percent of the collections, a significant portion was collected on state lands under federally mandated permitting procedures. The museum is a repository for collections from BLM, Forest Service, Park Service and Bureau of Reclamation lands. Additional specimens have been collected from Department of Defense lands as well. 
   There are numerous authorities defining the legal relationship between the federal agencies and museums and research universities such as the Smithsonian's Organic Act passed in 1879, the Antiquities Act of 1906, NEPA and most recently, the National Archaeological Graves Protection and Reburial Act of 1990. The large number of federal collections in the museum is the consequence of the high percentage of federally owned lands in Utah. Utah ranks second among all states in percentage of federal lands; thus, field research in the natural sciences in Utah largely takes place on federal lands. 
   Unfortunately, the current facilities at the Utah Museum of Natural History used to house the federal collections are inadequate. Lack of space, materials, supplies and personnel have created a situation where the collections are in jeopardy of being permanently lost. This is not in anyway caused by the neglect of the museum staff, but it is simply a lack of space and funding to adequately store all of the collections properly. 
   I became interested when this situation was brought to my attention a few months ago. Since that time, my staff have been looking into various options to help remedy the situation. In the meantime, the museum has done a tremendous job putting together a master plan, organizing partners and seeking private donations to relocate the museums. But they are limited in their ability to raise funds without some federal participation and commitment. And with that in mind, I want to seek the chairman's input on that question. Does the chairman believe that the federal agencies such as the BLM, Forest Service and the National Park Service have a legitimate role in helping remedy this situation? 
   MR. GORTON. The Senator raises a good point. Obviously there is a federal interest in protecting these collections. While I cannot commit to providing funding for this project in the future, I will work closely with my colleague from Utah. Until that time, however, I think it would be quite appropriate for the various agencies to lend their resources and expertise by participating the partnership that has been created. I would encourage them to do so. 
   MR. BENNETT. I thank the chairman and I look forward to working with him.

   Mr. BENNETT. Again, I thank the Chairman. I have one final question regarding the Desert Tortoise Recovery program. There is a proposal by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to create a new position of a tortoise recovery coordinator that reports out of the Reno Nevada office. This is of concern to me. As the Chairman knows, Washington County has made tremendous progress toward completing a Habitat Conservation Plan and recovery program. They have put together an effective, balanced team and compared to other recovery units, Washington County and its key partners including the State of Utah, BLM and State Parks have accomplished a great deal over the last five years. All of this was accomplished without a tortoise coordinator to oversee the project. 
   There are a couple of issues I believe should be addressed prior to the creation of proposed coordinator position. Issues such as determining which office would make section 7 evaluations regarding tortoises in Washington County--Salt Lake City or Reno? I would also like to know how the creation of such a position will impact funding and how do we insure that state and local communities are not adversely impacted. In order to preserve the good working relationship among the parties in Utah, I would hope the Chairman would support me in this position until these questions are answered.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Ute Economic Opportunity Act of 1999.'' This bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on September 9, 1999 by Representative CANNON. Currently, the Department of Energy administers the Naval Oil Shale Reserve Numbered 2, which is located in northeastern Utah. A portion of the Oil Shale Reserve exists on the Uintah and Ouray Reservation, which belongs to the Ute Indian Tribe. There have been several discussions that contemplate the transfer of the lands of the Oil Shale Reserve to the Bureau of Land Management. Due to the religious and historical significance of certain lands and the presence of wild horses and burros, the Ute Tribe is concerned that any transfer may infringe on their tribal rights and deviate from the current management direction. 
   This bill would continue the Department of Energy's administration of the Oil Shale Reserve, and also provide a significant opportunity for economic development to the Ute Tribe. The bill requires the Department of Energy to enter into a cooperative agreement with the Ute Tribe to develop a long-term plan to manage, develop, and administer the Oil Shale Reserve. Further, 180 days after enactment of this bill, the Ute Tribe will enter into an oil and gas lease with the Department of Energy to develop the hydrocarbon resources present in the Oil Shale Reserve. It should be noted that the Ute Tribe has a history of responsible stewardship over the development of one of the largest oil and gas fields in Utah. I fully anticipate that the leasing process will go forward in an environmentally responsible manner. I expect nothing less from the Department and the Tribe. 
   Through the management and utilization of these resources, the Ute Tribe will have an opportunity to develop high quality, high paying jobs that are sorely needed on the Uintah and Ouray Reservation while sustainably managing the land. 
   The Ute Economic Opportunity Act of 1999 is an important piece of legislation that will allow the Ute Tribe to pursue economic independence.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there are several provisions in this bill that result directly from the establishment of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. First, we have identified $300,000 within the amount allocated for the monument planning and decision making process. In FY 1999, $500,000 was provided to the two counties, and we anticipate that there will be funds available from the fee demonstration program that could return them to the FY 99 level. 
   Additionally, we provided $100,000 to implement the ``Garfield-Kane County Partnership Action Plan.'' This action plan is the result of a process that began last year to help the counties and communities that have been most impacted by the monument designation. This is not a welfare program; this is to help them with reorganization leading to economic self-sufficiency. The Department of Interior, to its credit, has supported this effort and provided funds for a conference that was held in Kane County earlier this year. The conference was mediated by the Sonoran Institute. The conference report is the basis for the funding. 
   The regional entities have formed a planning commission, the Partnership  Task Force, and are talking with the Utah Five County Association of Governments (AOG) to establish a new and independent entity within that organization, which will provide administrative support and organization. Direction will come from a board composed of elected county and city officials from Kane and Garfield Counties and from portions of the Arizona Counties (Coconino and Mohave), which are north and west of the Colorado River. This also includes the Kaibab Paiute Indian Reservation. 
   It is my understanding that the BLM will fund the Partnership Task Force through the Five County AOG and will cooperate in developing recommendations for the partnership action plan and specific programs. I would ask the Chairman if it is his expectation that the agency will periodically report on the progress being made?

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, a memorial service was held on Monday in Ft. Bliss, Texas, to honor five American men and women who lost their lives last week in the service of this country. On July 23, an Army airplane was reported missing over Colombia with five U.S. military personnel and two Colombians on board. The wreckage was located later in the week and days later, the Department of Defense confirmed the deaths of those on board. 
   Coffins draped with the Stars and Stripes left Bogota, and were flown to Ft. Bliss Texas, a wreching reminder of the continued sacrifice made by American men and women in the Armed Forces and of course their families. 
   One of the soldiers killed in the crash was Private First Class T. Bruce Cluff, a former resident of the city of Washington in my home state of Utah. Private Cluff served as one of 300 soldiers in a Battalion whose uniforms bear a crest that states ``Silently We Defend.'' 
   Mr. President, because we cannot, and should not, allow the untimely loss of those in uniform to go unnoticed, I rise today to pay tribute to Private T. Bruce Cluff, a soldier killed in the line of duty; a soldier who received the Army Good Conduct Medal; a soldier who volunteered to risk his life for the protection of our nation and its defense against aggressors. 
   T. Bruce Cluff was born in Mesa, Arizona, and as a member of the Boy Scouts of America, attained the rank of Eagle Scout at the age of 13. He graduated from Whitehorse High School in 1992, and served a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the state of Montana. Private Cluff attended Dixie College in Utah and worked as a Computer Aided Draftsman before enlisting in the Army in 1997. He completed basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and Advanced Individual Training (AIT) at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. 
   In mourning Cluff's death and announcing his posthumous promotion to the rank of specialist, a statement from the Army read, ``His commander and NCO supervisors regarded his skills--as superlative. His can-do attitude and enthusiasm embodied the motto of his platoon, which reads, `Excellence--Nothing Else is Acceptable.' '' 
   As a reminder to those of use who didn't know any of the soldiers personally, I share writings from George Washington which I believe shed light on a soldier's quiet commitment, and perhaps a tendency to forget what is asked of our men and women in uniform. The winter of 1777 was a bleak time in our nation's military history. George Washington, after his defeat at the Brandywine, established Winter Headquarters at Valley Forge. The soldiers were in rags, were sick and starving. Criticism of Washington from the Congress was loud, and spreading to the public. 
   On December 23, General Washington wrote to the Continental Congress, explaining that ``no less than 2,898 men now in camp are unfit for duty, because they are barefoot and otherwise naked. 
   He then addresses the criticism, ``But what makes this matter still more extraordinary in my eye is, that these very gentlemen--who were well apprised of the nakedness of our troops--should think a winter's campaign, and the covering of these States [New Jersey and Pennsylvania] from the invasion of an enemy, so easy and practicable a business. I can assure those gentlemen, that it is a much easier and less distressing thing to draw remonstrances in a comfortable room by a good fireside, than to occupy a cold, bleak hill, and sleep under frost and snow, without clothes or blankets. 
   Those of us who are in a `comfortable room by a good fireside,' should be reminded that the missions of the military are not comfortable nor are they easy. Even in peacetime, America has troops stationed all over the world, engaged in all manner of missions, and regrettably, none without threat. 
   There will be few who know about the Cluff's loss. Specialist Cluff, to use his new rank, has not had his picture on the cover of any magazine. His life hasn't been the subject of wide media attention. However, his young wife who is expecting their third child, and his remaining two children, have lost a husband and young father. His siblings have lost a brother and his parents have lost a son. This country has lost a good soldier. It mourns with his family and honors his memory. 
   May the Cluffs be comforted in their time of grief. As we remember them and ask God to watch over them and bring them solace, may we also remember the family members of the other military personnel who, with Specialist Cluff, made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation which amends the Central Utah Project Completion Act. This is a simple bill and I hope my colleagues will support it. 
   My father was elected to the Senate in 1950 and it was during that time that legislation was passed that created the Central Utah Project. During his 24 years in the Senate, my father fought to win the initial authorizations as well as provide the annual appropriations for the various projects. Were it not for the foresight of planners in the 1950s, Utah would be grappling with severe water shortages for both agricultural and municipal purposes today. 
   In 1992, the Central Utah Project was reauthorized with the passage of the Central Utah Project Completion Act of 1992 (CUPCA). As part of the 1992 Act, CUPCA provided strict authorization levels for each project and program. Seven years after the passage of the reauthorization bill, planning has neared completion on these projects. During that time, we have learned several things. First, we are pleased that the District and the Bureau have saved money on other projects authorized under CUPCA. At the same time, many of us were surprised how successful the water conservation activities have been. They have been so successful that it appears we are on track to reach the authorized funding in the near future. We have also learned that the acquisition of water rights and instream flows are inadequate in other areas. 
   Recognizing that there are shortfalls in some areas and significant savings achieved in other areas, this legislation simply amends the current law to permit the use of savings achieved in certain areas to be spent on other projects and programs where needed. By doing so, we can ensure that the projects can be completed in a timely and cost-effective manner.  
   By passing this legislation we can continue the progress made in completing the Central Utah Project. I hope my colleagues will support this bill and I look forward to working with the members of the Energy Committee to bring it to the floor for consideration.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I shall try to stay out of the more contentious part of this debate. But there is a point I think I have to make which has to do with the whole health care issue. That is, the health care system in this country is based on employer choice, not individual choice. I have spoken out against that. I did it during the debate on the Clintons' health care program. I have not made much headway, but this debate gives me the opportunity to point out, once again, that the benefits in a health care plan are always determined by the employer and not by the employee. 
   During the debate over the Clinton health care plan, people would say we should give everybody the same plan that you Senators have. I responded by saying I wish I had the same plan I had before I came to the Senate because I worked for an employer who gave me a better deal than the health care plan adopted by the Federal Government. I happened to be the CEO of that company. I, therefore, had something to say about what that deal would be. 
   I know of health care plans that deny pregnancy benefits. I would not want to work in such a place, having fathered six children. I took great advantage of the pregnancy benefits. But an employer could say and does often say: We can't afford pregnancy benefits. If you are going to have a baby, you are going to have to pay for it yourself. 
   Fortunately, during the period of time when I had no health care coverage because my employer could not afford it, we did not have any children. We had our six children under plans that provided pregnancy benefits. But it is not unusual for benefits to vary from company to company, from employer to employer, and for the employer to make the decision. 
   The decision will be made on the basis of the conscience of individual Senators. But let us understand that as the employers of Federal employees, we are not engaged in any unusual activity to make a decision as to which procedures will be covered and which will not, and there are a whole host of procedures in the Government health care plan that are not covered for which other plans pay. 
   That is the way the system works. I would like to change the system and give the individual the right to control those dollars absolutely, but I know of no program under our current tax laws where that is done, except in the case of the self-employed. Unfortunately, within this Chamber, we have made the decision not to allow the self-employed to deduct the entire cost of that decision. 
   I add those particular facts to this debate, trying to stay out of the more emotional side of it. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, Utah has at least 30 dams that currently do not meet current safety standards. Most of these dams were built more than 30 years ago by either the Bureau of Reclamation, the Soil Conservation Service or the state for a variety of purposes such as flood control, irrigation or municipal purposes or for wildlife enhancement. As these dams have aged, safety concerns have increased. We now find ourselves facing tremendous and expensive safety issues. 
   Earlier this year, I requested additional funding for research related to monitoring and manipulating subsurface flows which affect Bureau dams. It is my hope that this research could be utilized to help address dam safety across the West. Unfortunately, given the committee allocation, it was not possible to provide increased funding this year. 
   I know that the Bureau is seeking to conduct more extensive research to determine the possibility of manipulating subsurface flows and the effects on dam safety. Utah State University's Water Research Lab has been identified as a leader in this effort. I also requested funding to be directed toward the Dam Breach Modeling program which would research additional modeling of dam failure scenarios. This research would include water tracking technologies to monitor internal movement of water through dams, and allow the Bureau to explore applying this technology to specific Western dams. 
   The technology would provide the Dam Safety program with additional tools to gather information on internal conditions and analyze dam integrity and make predictions on possible impacts from floods, earthquakes and similar events. It is anticipated that after a testing period, assistance could be made available to federal and state dam safety officials in assessment programs. 
   Utah, New Mexico, Idaho and almost all western states have potentially serious dam safety problems. New technologies could provide information to identify high risk areas and define the critical flows and leaks that threaten a structure. 
   As a member of the subcommittee, I certainly understand the pressures on the chairman because of the budget limitations and personally know that he has done everything he can to meet the enormous and competing demands. I hope that should additional funds become available down the road, the Committee would consider these requests at some funding level.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I understand that the senior Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, is on her way to the floor. I will wait until she is here to express to the entire Senate my appreciation for her assistance as the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee of Appropriations. 
   I have been delighted to have the opportunity to work with her on this legislation and I will make that clear when she arrives. I understand she is in another committee meeting, and in the pattern of the Senate, finds herself torn between two equally important responsibilities. That is a situation with which we are all familiar. 
   I will, for the information of Senators, point out that the legislative branch bill provides $1.68 billion in budget authority, exclusive of House items, for fiscal year 2000. This is $114 million or 6.4 percent less than the fiscal 1999 level. It represents $105 million or a 5.9-percent decrease from the President's budget request. So in this time of difficulty, we are coming in below last year's spending and below where the President recommended. 
   There are increases in the bill, of course. There always will be in an appropriations bill. You cut some places, and you increase others. The majority of the increases in the bill account for cost-of-living adjustments only, and they are estimated at 4.4 percent across the board. 
   The Senate portion of the bill increases funding for the Senate by only 3 percent above the fiscal 1999 level, which is less than the 4.4-percent COLA adjustment. So while the Senate portion of the bill is going up, it is going up less than the mandatory COLA that is required by law. 
   The bill funds 79 percent of the budget request of the Architect of the Capitol. Of the funds provided, 73 percent will fund operations, with the other 27 percent to fund Capitol projects. 
   I have always been one who has insisted on funding Capitol projects. As a businessman, I know that sometimes the most expensive savings you can achieve are savings that you take in the name of maintenance deferral. As things begin to deteriorate around the Capitol, it is tempting to say we can put it off for another year and look good in the short term. All you do when you do that is raise your costs in the long term. So throughout my tenure on the Legislative Branch Subcommittee and particularly my tenure as the chairman of that subcommittee, I have always been a champion of funding the Capitol projects and funding the maintenance projects to their fullest level, believing that in the long run that saves money. 
   Why then am I standing here today and saying that we are not going to do that in this bill, and we are not giving the Architect of the Capitol the funds that were requested? Well, there are several reasons for that. I think it is worth an explanation. 
   The subcommittee did not fund the Architect's request for $28 million for Capitol dome renovations. I have been in the Capitol dome with the Architect of the Capitol, and I have seen firsthand how desperately in need of renovation it is. However, the full scope of the project will be determined during the paint removal process which is currently underway. The paint removal process is not expected to be completed  until next summer. Therefore, I think it prudent for us to delete the funds from this bill until we have the completion of that process and have the information available to us that will come as a result. That is why we do not recommend proceeding until the full scope of the project has been determined. That is where a large part of the savings that we referred to have come from. 
   I see the Senator from California has arrived. I wish to make public acknowledgment of the great contribution she has made to the Legislative Branch Subcommittee. This is her first assignment on the subcommittee as its ranking member, and I have found her not only delightful and cooperative to deal with but, perhaps even more appreciated, fully engaged. It is one thing to have a colleague who is nice to deal with but who never shows up and never pays any attention to any of the issues. The Senator from California not only shows up but comes with her homework having been done, a full agenda of her own, and complete understanding of the issues. I appreciate very much the opportunity I have had of working with her and welcome her to the subcommittee and to this particular bill.

   Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, as one who voted against the air war and called for the suspension of bombing on the grounds that it was not working, I rise to acknowledge clearly, and indeed even joyfully, that we have reached a significant milestone and have turned a significant and most welcome corner in our humanitarian effort to stop the butchery in the Balkans. I congratulate President Clinton, Secretary Cohen and, of course, the men and women of all ranks in the U.S. military for their ability to project American military power for good in a distant land. 
   I also congratulate Secretary Albright for her ability to hold together an occasionally fractious coalition. With the bombing stopped and NATO troops moving unopposed into Kosovo, it is certainly a time for celebration. It is not, however, a time to suggest that the problems of the Balkans are at an end, or even that the end is in sight. There have been many mentions of Winston Churchill in the last few months. I am reminded of one of Churchill's comments from World War II, made as he celebrated America's entry into that war:  
   It is not the end of the war. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is the end of the beginning.  
   Let us review where we have been, where we are, and what we still have to do before there is peace in the Balkans. 
   First, where we have been. As happy as we are with today's headlines, let us remember that we failed to meet our initial objectives. Secretary Albright told us that we had to bomb to prevent widespread atrocities in Kosovo and a flood of refugees over its borders into neighboring countries. The bombing failed to do that, and the resultant human suffering has been immense and is continuing. 
   Even at this point, let us not deceive ourselves about the effectiveness of the bombing. One of the reasons I was wrong in suggesting that the bombing would not work was that I did not know that the Kosovar Liberation Army would mount a serious offensive on the ground. It failed. But it caused the Serbian military to leave its hidden sanctuaries in order to repulse the Kosovars. Only then, while the Serbian military was engaged in ground action,  was the force of NATO air power able to inflict heavy damage in the field. Prior to that, the results of our bombing on Serb military capacity were frustratingly meager. I find it interesting that the KLA offensive was neither foreseen in advance, nor now, in our jubilant mood, widely reported after the fact. Those who claim that the bombing worked all by itself need to take a second look at what really happened. 
   Next, where are we now? The refugees are still not back in their homes, in their villages. Their homes are still not rebuilt. Their economy, which will permit them to feed themselves, is still in shambles. Further, the Kosovar Serbs, as opposed to the Kosovar Albanians, are now in fear of their lives, and a new flood of refugees is flowing north. Their numbers are far fewer than those of the returnees, but the Serbian refugees entering that part of Yugoslavia will swell the ranks of the still-unsettled refugees that came there from Bosnia, where any form of long-term peace is still elusive. The Yugoslav economy--indeed, the regional economy--including neighboring countries such as Romania, is in shambles in no small part because of our attacks on the infrastructure in and around Belgrade. 
   Winter comes early in the Balkans and the prospects of widespread suffering remains high. So what do we still have to do? Our first priority should be the humanitarian relief required to alleviate the suffering in both parts of Yugoslavia, Serbia as well as Kosovo. Hand in hand should be efforts to repair the damage the bombing has done so that the economic activity that is the only hope for self-sufficiency can begin. But our hardest challenge is to keep the killing from breaking out again on both sides. It may be easy for some to say that the Serbs deserve whatever revenge the Kosovar Albanians will mete out, 
   and that they only get what they asked for simply by being Serbs. 
   That is the attitude held by most ethnic groups in the region that got us into this mess in the first place. It should be repugnant to all Americans. All of them should celebrate the ethnic diversity from which each one of us comes. 
   The biggest long-term burden NATO's occupying force bears is the responsibility to see that no new round of ethnic hatred and retaliation takes place, whoever initiates it and whatever its supposed justification. 
   In sum, this is the time to be glad, because, with an unexpected and strong assist from the Kosovar Liberation Army, we made a deal whereby the bombing has been stopped and the rebuilding can start. It is not a time to cry, ``Hurrah, we won,'' and then walk away from the immense humanitarian tragedy we were unable to prevent and to which in some degree our bombing contributed. 
   Above all, it is not a time for us to think there are any easy answers or short-term solutions or that the antagonisms of the region are easily divided into good guys and bad guys. Americans must recognize that we are in Kosovo for a very long haul now and working against very long odds if we are ever going to help the various factions achieve any hope of living peacefully side by side. In our time of congratulations, let us recognize that we are only ``at the end of the beginning.'' 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Reauthorization Act of 1999. This legislation will reauthorize the funding of this program to a level of $175 million and will permit these important projects to continue forward for several years. 
   I do this because the Colorado River is the life link for more than 23 million people. It provides irrigation water for more than 4 million acres of land in the United States. Therefore, the quality of the water is crucial. 
   Salinity is one of the major problems affecting the quality of the water. Salinity damages range between $500 million and $750 million and could exceed $1.5 billion per year if future increases in salinity are not controlled. In an effort to limit future damages, the Basin States (Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) and the Federal Government enacted the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act in 1974. Because the lengthy Congressional authorization process for Bureau of Reclamation projects was impeding the implementation of cost-effective measures, Congress authorized the Bureau in 1995 to implement a competitive, basin-wide approach for salinity control. 
   Under the new approach, termed the Basinwide Program salinity control projects were no longer built by the Federal Government. They were, for the most part, to be built by the private sector and local and state governments. Funds would be awarded to projects on a competitive bid basis. Since this was a pilot program, Congress originally limited funds to a $75 million ceiling. 
   Indeed, the Basinwide Salinity Program has far exceeded original expectations by proving to be both cost effective and successful. It has an average cost of $27 per ton of salt controlled, as compared to original authority program projects that averaged $76 per ton. One of the greatest advantages of the new program comes from the integration of Reclamation's program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's program. By integrating the USDA's on-farm irrigation improvements with the Bureau's off-farm improvements, very high efficiency rates can be obtained. 
   Because the cost sharing partners (private organizations and states and federal agencies) often have funds available at specific times, the new program allows the Bureau of Reclamation to quickly respond to opportunities that are time sensitive. Another significant advantage of the Basinwide program is that completed projects are ``owned'' by the local entity, and not the Bureau. The entity is responsible for performing under the proposal negotiated with the Bureau. 
   In 1998, Bureau of Reclamation received a record number of proposals. While still working through the 1998 proposals, the Bureau also sought out 1999 proposals which are just now being received and evaluated. Although, not all proposals will be fully funded and constructed, funding requirements for even the most favorable projects surpasses the original $75 million funding authority. In fact, if all proposals go to completion and are fully funded, the Bureau might find itself in the position that no future requests for proposals can be considered until Congress raises the authorization ceiling. In an effort to prevent that from occurring, I am introducing this legislation today. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and I look forward to working on this legislation with them.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am reluctant to get into this fight because, as I said before, I am unburdened with legal education. Occasionally when I hear these legal debates, it makes me grateful for the fact that I did not go to law school. 
   However, I feel the need to stand and comment on some of the things that have been heard and some of the statements that have been made with respect to this particular amendment. 
   It is my understanding that anybody who commits an intentional act of fraud has no relief as a result of this bill. If anybody can contradict that, I will be happy to hear it, because I do not want, in any way, to be part of supporting a bill that protects people from intentional fraud. That is not my purpose. 
   I must stand, as the chairman of the Senate Special Committee On The Year 2000 Technology Problem, and tell my colleagues that this is a unique situation. This has the potential of creating a unique chain of events that requires a unique solution. That is the purpose of the McCain-Dodd-Wyden bill, and that is why the bill has a 3-year sunset in it. We are not changing the world forever. We are crafting, as carefully as we can, a piece of legislation to deal with the unique circumstance of the Year 2000.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, again I witness this clash between great legal minds. Yet, I am informed by a number of other legal minds the Kerry amendment would, in fact, destroy the effect of the bill. As a businessman, I always ended up asking my legal team whether it was appropriate for me to sign a particular lease or contract. I had to learn to depend on good lawyers. I think we have hired good lawyers in this situation and I am accepting their advice. I am moved by the eloquence of my friend from Massachusetts, but I shall not vote with him. 
   I want to once again focus on what it is we are doing here. We are dealing with a unique situation the likes of which we have never seen in international commerce and probably never will see again. That is why specific legislation is necessary. 
   Let me go back to a statement made by my friend from Massachusetts in the earlier debate when he said: We want people to be driven to examine their inventory to make sure it is compliant, but if the liability is limited they will not do that. This is not a question of examining your inventory to make sure it is compliant. We are already getting examples of people who have done everything prudent and possible to make sure that things were compliant with Y2K, only to discover after they had done everything prudent that it still didn't work. There are bugs hidden in this kind of problem that cannot in reasonable fashion be discovered in advance. There is a presumption on the part of the Senator from Massachusetts that those bugs were there because of some misrepresentation or fraud. My concern is that there will be that presumption on the part of a lawyer bringing suit if those bugs occur in equipment that at one time or another has passed through the hands of a very wealthy corporation. 
   This is where proportionality of joint and several liability comes in. If a corporation with deep pockets has at one time or another had its hands, figuratively, on a product where such a Y2K glitch occurs, there will be an obvious invitation to sue that corporation and then settle out of court for a large settlement because the corporation will decide, on business terms, it is cheaper to settle than proceed with the suit. 
   I have had the experience as CEO of a company of settling a lawsuit where I felt the merits were firmly on our side but where the economics said you do your shareholders a better service by taking this settlement than you do by going to court. I have had personal experience with that. I know how those kinds of decisions are made. In a situation where there will be unforeseen consequences and products that have passed through many hands in order to finally get to where they go, the temptation to sue the deep pockets will be overwhelming unless we pass this legislation. Every lawyer that I have spoken to who has examined the legislation from that point of view has said you cannot adopt the Kerry amendment. It will gut the legislation. It will render the whole thing moot, as far as we are concerned. 
   So I stand here not as a lawyer but as a businessman who has now, for 3 years, immersed himself in the Y2K issue and, frankly, who feels he understands that issue fairly well. I call on my colleagues to defeat the Kerry amendment, to pass this legislation, and to give to American firms--not just high-tech --give to American firms that will be involved in products that will suffer from Y2K problems the ability to solve those problems without the specter of huge lawsuits and huge settlements hanging over them. 
   Let me go back to one thing I said and repeat it. As I have been immersed in this issue for the period of time I have, I have come to realize that it is not strictly a high-tech issue. Yes, the high-tech community has been the most visible in pushing for this legislation. But they are by no means the only part of the American economy that will be affected by this issue. There will be municipalities that can be sued. There will be cities around this country that will suddenly discover that essential services do not work, that will have done everything they thought reasonable to get there only to have some glitch that they were unaware of come out of the blue. 
   Then the lawsuits will start. The question will be who was in the supply chain to produce whatever the device is that failed. Let's see who has the deepest pockets. It may not be a high-tech company at all. States are scrambling now to try to pass their own limited liability. I think that is a mistake. I think the Federal legislation makes a lot more sense. But let us understand, once again, we have a unique situation here. We already have anecdotal evidence that shows us how capricious it can be, in spite of the greatest effort to remediate and be in control. We do not want to turn this into a playground for plaintiffs' lawyers who want to take advantage of the class action circumstance, sue the deepest pockets, take a settlement, and walk away in a way that is of no advantage to anybody. 
   If we are making a mistake in this bill, if as we draft it there is mischief, it is not permanent mischief because the bill is gone at the end of 3 years. Everything is over at the end of 3 years. No one--no one--will make any attempt to extend it. Certainly I will not. By virtue of what the voters of Utah did, I will be here 3 years from now, if I am still alive, and I will certainly oppose any extension of this bill. I would think everybody would oppose any extension if somebody were to bring it up. 
   We are facing a unique situation. We have a piece of intelligently crafted legislation to try to deal with that situation, and we should not let ourselves get convinced that we are somehow changing the basis of American jurisprudence for all time as we try to take a prudent step in this particular circumstance. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Just so the record is clear, the subject of the Kerry amendment came up in that discussion, and Mr. Grove, if I am quoting him correctly, said that his lawyers felt that the Kerry amendment would destroy the bill and leave it with no value. Indeed, my memory says he said that if the Kerry amendment was adopted, they would be better off without any bill. I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he has the same memory or if I am embroidering things.

   We hear again on the floor the threat of a Presidential veto. We hear that increasingly, as if the President should write legislation and we should supinely accept whatever the President recommends, that our function is simply to listen to the President, pass legislation that he announces in advance is acceptable and, thereby, abdicate our legislative responsibilities. 
   I am perfectly willing to risk a Presidential veto. I think that is the appropriate posture for a Member of the Senate. 
   I ask consent that following the debate in relation to amendment No. 610, the Senate proceed to an amendment to be offered by Senator MURKOWSKI or his designee and no other amendments in order prior to 6 p.m., and that at 5:50, there be 10 minutes for explanation followed by a vote in relation to the Kerry amendment No. 610.

    Mr. BENNETT. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1999. This legislation would authorize additional funds for lupus research and grants for state and local governments to support the delivery of essential services to low-income individuals with lupus and their families. The National Institute of Health (NIH) spent about $42 million less than one half of one percent of its budget on lupus research last year. I believe that we need to increase the funds that are available for research of this debilitating disease. 
   Lupus is not a well-known disease, nor is it well understood. Yet, at least 1,400,000 Americans have been diagnosed with lupus and many more are either misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. More Americans have lupus than AIDS, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, sickle-cell anemia or cystic fibrosis. Lupus is a disease that attacks and weakens the immune system and is often life-threatening. Lupus is nine times more likely to affect women than men. African-American women are diagnosed with lupus two to three times more often than Caucasian women. Lupus is also more prevalent among certain minority groups including Latinos, Native Americans and Asians. 
   Because lupus is not well understood, it is difficult to diagnose, leading to uncertainty on the actual number of patients suffering from lupus. The symptoms of lupus make diagnosis difficult because they are sporadic and imitate the symptoms of many other illnesses. If diagnosed early and with proper treatment, the majority of lupus cases can be controlled. Unfortunately, because of the difficulties in diagnosing lupus and inadequate research, many lupus patients suffer debilitating pain and fatigue. The resulting effects make it difficult, if not impossible, for individuals suffering from lupus to carry on normal everyday activities including the demands of a job. Thousands of these debilitating cases needlessly end in death each year. 
   Title I of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1999 authorizes $75 million in grants starting in fiscal year 2000 to be earmarked for lupus research at NIH. This new authorization would amount to less than one half of one percent of NIH's total budget but would greatly enhance NIH's research. 
   Title II of the Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 1999 authorizes $40 million in grants to state and local governments as well as to nonprofit organizations starting in fiscal year 2000. These funds would support the delivery of essential services to low-income individuals with lupus and their families. I would urge all my colleagues, Mr. President, to join Senator MURRAY, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator SCHUMER, and myself in sponsoring this legislation to increase funding to fight lupus.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to call for a suspension of the bombing in Kosovo, not because of anything Milosevic has done, such as the release of three American servicemen; not because of differing opinions within NATO, such as those currently being expressed by the Italians and the Germans; not because of the inadvertent damage done to accidental targets, such as the Chinese Embassy; and not because of any personal animus or distrust of any individuals in this administration. No; I oppose continuation of the bombing in Kosovo because it has not worked. It is not working and shows no signs of working in the future. 
   The bombing has been of no help to the Kosovars, hundreds of thousands of whom have lost their homes, their neighbors, their children and perhaps even their lives while the bombing has gone on. It has been of no help to the Albanians or the Macedonians who have seen hundreds of thousands of refugees flood cross the borders into their ill-equipped countries. It has been of no help to NATO, an alliance that has seen its military stocks drawn down to dangerously low levels with no effect on the atrocities going on in the killing fields. And the bombing has been of no help to our relationships with nations outside of NATO, particularly Russia and China, who have vigorously opposed our decision to proceed. 
   Again, in short, the bombing has not worked, even though we have persisted for a longer time than we bombed in Desert Storm. My call for suspending the bombing comes from the modern wisdom that says: If at first you don't succeed, try something else. 
   There are those, including my colleagues on the Senate floor, commentators and columnists for whom I have the utmost respect, who say we cannot even consider suspension of the bombing. We are at war, they say; we must press on to victory. Anything else would be dishonorable, and on a practical geopolitical level, would send the wrong signal to others who might choose to confront us in the future. 
   Such language is often called Churchillian, echoing the electrifying rhetoric of the indomitable prime minister speaking in the darkest days of World War II. 
   No one has a higher regard for the magnificent rhetoric and the deeds of Winston Churchill than I, but, to me, the mantra, ``Because we're in, we have to win,'' is more suitable for a bumper sticker than it is for Winston Churchill. 
   Let me take you to a Churchillian episode that I think applies here, and it comes not from the darkest days of World War II but World War I. 
   Those who remember their history will remember that Winston Churchill fell into great disregard during World War I as a result of his sponsorship of the Dardanelles operation. He was removed from any position of responsibility. But because he was still an officer in the British Army, he agreed, indeed sought for, the opportunity to go to the front in France. And so, as Major Churchill, he went to the front, and unlike most British officers of the time, he really went to the front. He went all the way to the front lines and saw for himself over a period of time the horrors and the futility of trench warfare. He saw it firsthand, and he came away convinced that it was not working. 
   When he returned to England, he became Minister of Munitions and put his full support and strength behind searching for an alternative. If you will, he put aside the patriotic rhetoric of his time and sought for a policy that would work. William Manchester, in his biography of Churchill called the ``Last Line,'' refers to Churchill as the father of the tank. It was Winston Churchill who caught the vision of the fact that you could do something different and created the modern tank, or created the 
   prototype of what became the modern tank, and revolutionized warfare, eliminating the failures of trench warfare. 
   If at first you don't succeed, try something else. The legacy of Winston Churchill was that he was willing to try something else when he saw the reality of the failure on the ground. I think, frankly, that is the Churchillian example we should seek to follow now: Suspend the bombing and try something else. 
   There are many suggestions on the table. The one, of course, we hear the most these days is send in the ground troops. To those who urge this, I ask, as I asked when the bombing was proposed in the first place: Will it work? Will it accomplish our goals? And with that question, we get the next obvious question: What are our goals? 
   When Secretary Madeleine Albright made the case for the bombing to the Senators in the Capitol, she told us if we did not bomb, the following would happen: First, there would be brutal atrocities and ethnic cleansing throughout all of Kosovo with tens of thousands of people being slaughtered and hundreds of thousands driven from their homes. 
   Second, she said there will be a flood of refugees across the borders into neighboring countries, swamping their already fragile economies. 
   Third, she said there will be splits within NATO. This alliance will be torn apart by disagreements. 
   And finally, she said Milosevic will strengthen his hand on his local political situation. 
   That was 8 weeks ago. Now, 8 weeks later, the bombing has failed to prevent any of those results. All four of them have taken place--the ethnic cleansing and the brutality and the atrocities have gone on; the refugees have appeared across the borders; NATO is split with arguments going on among its top leaders; and Milosevic has been strengthened as the leader, martyr, hero, if you will, of the Yugoslavs. We have not achieved a single goal that the bombing set out to accomplish. I come back to the same question: What are our new goals? 
   As best I can understand them, from the various statements that have been made, one list of the new goals would be as follows: No. 1, removal of all Serbian influence in Kosovo; No. 2, a return of the Kosovars physically to their land; No. 3, a rebuilding of their homes and villages; and No. 4, an international police force in there for an indefinitely long period of time to guarantee that their homes will always be protected.  
   Let us accept those goals for just a moment. I ask the same fundamental question I asked in the beginning with respect to bombing. Will it work? Will continuation of the bombing achieve these four new goals when it did not achieve the four old ones? And what about ground troops? Will ground troops achieve these new goals? 
   On the first question, as to whether the continuation of the bombing will achieve these new goals, there is disagreement from the experts. In this morning's Washington Post, General Short says: ``Yes, we will see the achievement of these goals within a matter of months.'' Last Friday, the Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said, ``No, there was no indication that bombing would achieve the goals.'' 
   I ask this fundamental humanitarian question: Do we have to continue to destroy the economy of Yugoslavia, depriving the civilian population of power and water, as we did over the weekend, raising the specter of the epidemic spread of typhoid while we decide who is right, while we decide which opinion is the correct one? Can we not suspend the bombing while that debate goes on? 
   With respect to ground troops, and those who say ground troops are the only answer, those who are calling for an invasion and an indefinitely long occupation of part of Serbia, that part known as Kosovo, to them I would refer the words of Daniel Ellsberg that appeared in the New York Times last Friday. I find them chilling. I would like to read them now at some length. I cannot paraphrase them and put them in any better form than Mr. Ellsberg himself. He says, referring to a ground invasion in Kosovo:  
   ..... I believe, it would be a death sentence for most Albanians remaining in Kosovo. 
   By all accounts, it would take weeks to months to deploy an invasion force to the region once the decision to do so was made, and Slobodan Milosevic already has troops there fortifying the borders. Wouldn't the prospect of an invasion lead him to order his forces in Kosovo to kill all the military-age male Albanians and hold the rest of the population as hostages rather than continuing to deport them?  
   A very, very important question. 
   Daniel Ellsberg goes on:  
   We don't know how many male Kosovars of military age--broadly, [those] from 15 to 60 years old--have been killed already.  
   He says:  
   But even if the number is in the tens of thousands ..... that would mean that most of the men were still alive. Facing invasion, would Mr. Milosevic allow any more men to leave Kosovo to be recruited by the K.L.A., or to live to support the invasion? The Serbs could quickly slaughter 100,000 to 200,000 male Kosovars. (In Rwanda five years ago, an average of 8,000 civilians a day were killed for 100 days, mostly with machetes.) 
   Obviously, Mr. Milosevic and his subordinates are brutal enough to do that. If they haven't done it already (and there is no testimony [to suggest] that they have on that scale) it may well be because they fear that such an annihilation would make an invasion inevitable. A commitment now to ground invasion would remove that deterrent, just as the commitment in March to begin bombing in support of an ultimatum and the consequent withdrawal of international monitors removed an implicit deterrent against sweeping ethnic cleansing and expulsion. 
   As for to the remaining civilians in Kosovo--women, children and old people--tens of thousands of them could be used against the invasion as human shields, in a way never before seen in warfare. Fighting in built-up areas, NATO troops would probably be fired on from buildings that were packed on every floor with Kosovar women and children. Using the traditional means--explosives, artillery and rockets--to destroy those buildings would make NATO forces the mass executioners of the people we were fighting to protect.  
   The column goes on. I shall not continue with it except to summarize the grim conclusion. Mr. Ellsberg says:  
   ..... We bombed Vietnam for seven and a half years in pursuit of goals we refused to compromise and never secured.  
   I find that a chilling summary in terms of some of the language we are hearing now: We must never compromise until our goals are secured. The first goals laid out were not secured. We now have a new set of goals and we are determined once again not to give in. 
   When I first went into the briefing room to hear Secretary Albright, Secretary Cohen, National Security Adviser Berger, and General Shelton give us the justification for proceeding in this area, I went in with no preconceptions one way or the other. Contrary to assumptions that have been made in the press about those of us who voted against the bombing, I did not carry any impeachment baggage into that briefing. 
   I have a history of backing President Clinton when I think he is right. I supported him on the recognition of Vietnam, on most favored nation status for China, on the Mexican peso bailout, on NATO expansion, on NAFTA and GATT and fast track, all to the discomfort of some of my constituents. I did so because I thought the President was right. And I went into that briefing very much capable of being convinced. 
   But during the briefing, as I became more and more uneasy about what I was hearing, when it came my turn to speak, I said to Secretary Albright: Let me give you a little bit of history. 
   I did that because she had quoted history to us, talking about the Balkans being the beginning of World War I and the battleground of World War II. 
   And she said: If we don't act quickly enough, this will be the spark that sets off World War III. 
   I did not choose to argue with her history. World War I did not begin because of a fight over the Balkans. While there were battles in World War II which occurred there, to be sure, the pivotal points in World War II were in places like North Africa, Stalingrad, Normandy, and Bastogne, not to mention, of course, Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, and Leyte Gulf. 
   No. I said to her: Madam Secretary, let me give you a little piece of history. This comes out of the Eisenhower administration, presided over by a military general who had achieved international fame for his strategic vision. This is when he was President. 
   I said, ``A group of his advisers came to him to describe an international situation and to recommend a military solution. They laid out all of the military actions they wanted to take and then said, Mr. President, it will achieve these results.'' 
   President Eisenhower listened very carefully and then asked: ``Are you willing to take the next step?'' They replied, ``What do you mean, Mr. President?'' 
   He said, ``If this doesn't work, this first step that you have outlined, are you willing to take the next step?'' 
   ``Oh, Mr. President,'' they said, ``the next step won't be necessary. There won't need to be any next steps. This first step will work.'' 
   President Eisenhower asked again, ``You have not answered my question. Are you willing to take the next step?'' 
   ``Well, let us explain to you, Mr. President, why the next---- 
   He said, ``I accept your analysis that this will probably work. I accept your analysis that people will probably react in the way you are suggesting they will react. But I am asking you this question: `Are you willing to take the next step if the first one does not work?' And if the answer is `No', then don't take the first step.'' 
   I asked, ``Madam Secretary, my question to you is, `Are you willing to take the next step?' If this doesn't work, what do we do?'' 
   I got conversation, but I did not get an answer to my question. I came out of that briefing saying, unless I can get an answer to that question, I will vote against the bombing. I was not satisfied and I did vote against the bombing. 
   I did not prevail in this Chamber. A majority of the Members voted in favor of the bombing, and so we have now had 8 weeks of it. 
   That date has an interesting meaning for me, because in this conversation, in the briefing, they were asked, ``How long will it take for us to find out if this is going to work?'' We were told repeatedly, ``We can't tell you that. We don't know.'' 
   Finally, in some frustration, I spoke out of turn and said to the briefer, ``How long would you be surprised if it were more than?'' 
   I got kind of a dirty look and then grumpily the fellow said: ``8 weeks.'' 
   Well, it has now been 8 weeks, and it hasn't worked, which is why I am here saying let's suspend the bombing while we talk about something that might. Let us stop destroying the economy of Yugoslavia while we talk about what might work in Kosovo, because our destruction of water works and television stations and power-generating plants in Belgrade has had no effect on the  killing in Kosovo. Can't we stop killing civilians who are not involved in this while we talk about what our options might be? 
   I think one of the most trenchant and insightful analyses of what happened to this country in Vietnam was written by Barbara Tuchman in a book called ``The March of Folly.'' In that book she described how people persist in going after solutions that do not work, because they do not want to admit that it won't work, and they are sure that if we just keep bombing a little bit longer, somehow something will work out. 
   Shortly after I had my exchange with Secretary Albright, the President, President Clinton, was asked, ``What will you do if the bombing does not work?'' He was asked by the Prime Minister of Italy. According to the Washington Post, he looked startled at the question, then turned to National Security Advisor Sandy Berger for an answer. Mr. Berger gave him the answer, ``We will continue bombing.'' 
   To me, that is folly. To me, that is not Churchillian. To me, that is not looking around to see what else might be there. I suggest, again, I call for a suspension of the bombing while we review our options, admit that the bombing hasn't worked and try to devise a new strategy that will. Perhaps there is none. After all of this analysis we may come to the conclusion there is nothing we can do now that the brutalities have taken place and the Kosovars have been driven from their homes. There may be nothing we can do effectively to restore them. For those who say how humiliating it would be for the United States to admit that, I ask this question, ``How humiliating will it be if we go forward and fail to achieve our goals? Wouldn't we have been better off in Vietnam if we had admitted that we were not getting it done long before the time came when that humiliating scene we all saw on our television screens of the helicopters above the Embassy in Saigon was broadcast throughout all the world?'' 
   I voted for the supplemental bill that provided the military funds with respect to the operation in Kosovo. I did so because I lost the first debate. The bombing went on. The funds were spent. The President has exhausted all of the funds of the Department of Defense through the balance of this year, and it would be irresponsible, in my view, not to replenish those funds so the Defense Department can function now. I voted to replenish the funds that have already been spent. But I call on us to stop spending those funds now, while we undertake a comprehensive review of our strategy and address, once again, the fundamental question 
   that was not answered in the beginning, and has not been answered so far, which is still, ``Will it work?'' 
   I conclude by saying that the historic figure upon whom I called for the rationality of answering that question is Winston Churchill, the man who went to the front lines and saw that trench warfare was insanity and came back to become the father of the tank, who looked for another alternative. There must be something better than what is happening in Kosovo right now. Let us suspend the bombing and search for it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I have an additional 5 minutes under my control, which I yield to the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, 2 minutes is all I will need. 
   In a perfect world, I would oppose the amendment with respect to the unitary thrift situation, but as the Senator from Texas has made clear, we do not live in a perfect theoretical world. We have existing institutions who have obligations to their shareholders and who have past history. However much I might like to see the past history be different, it is as it is. 
   Under those circumstances, I think we cannot penalize people who have gone forward on assurances from the Federal Government and say that those assurances will not now be honored just because we do not think they should have been given in the first place. 
   For that reason, Mr. President, I will be joining with the chairman of the committee and voting as he does on this issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment has been cleared on both sides. 
   It addresses the CRA issue in what I hope is a noncontroversial way in that it calls for reporting of what happens to the CRA loans. Many of these loans are being made now with no regulation at all and no public understanding of what is happening. I, for example, asked a simple question as I went through the CRA debate. I said, What is the rate of default of CRA loans compared to non-CRA loans? And, specifically, what is the rate of default of those loans that are made through the advocacy groups that become loan brokers? 
   I was told the rate of failure for CRA loans generally is about six or seven times higher than normal loans but there was no information as to the rate of default among those loans that were made through the advocacy groups that have become loan brokers. I think we are entitled to know that. 
   This is simply a sunshine amendment that will report the facts. It does not change the regulatory situation in any way, it does not damage CRA in any way; it simply says the Congress will know what is happening with respect to CRA loans that are currently being made in the dark.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened to this debate with some interest. I have enormous respect for members of the Banking Committee on which I have served since I came to the Senate. I know there is good intention on both sides of the issue, on both sides of the aisle. 
   I echo the comments of the chairman of the committee in that much of the debate that I have heard has been focused on the wrong issue; that is, you would think that this was an attempt on the part of the majority in the committee to repeal CRA. I do not condone redlining. I recognize that the decision which was made by the Congress in 1977 to create CRA was motivated by a genuine abuse that required a genuine Federal fix. 
   At the same time, I recognize also that under Secretary Rubin's leadership, attempts have been made to alleviate the regulatory burden of CRA, that there has been a recognition on the part of this administration--I think belatedly, but nonetheless I will accept it whenever I can get it--a recognition that CRA has gotten out of hand and has become, in some instances, a paperwork burden that is nonproductive and anticompetitive and puts an undue burden on places where it should not be. 
   The question is not, Should we abolish CRA? The answer to that is clearly no. The question is not, Should we turn our backs on those people who have been benefited by CRA? The answer to that is no. 
   The question is, Can we streamline CRA, as we are going through the process of modernizing our financial institutions, in a way that recognizes the reality of the marketplace? And there the answer is yes. 
   One of the criticisms which has been made, and I think with some justification, is that a good part of the debate has been anecdotal; that is, one situation has been described, and we extrapolate from that, and then another has been described, and we extrapolate from that. 
   I agree with those members of the committee who have suggested at some point it would be well for the committee to have hearings on the whole CRA matter and examine it at great detail. I think that is a salutary thing to do. 
   But we have an opportunity here in this bill to take some steps which I consider to be relatively modest and relatively straightforward. The one I want to focus on is the exemption of CRA, the CRA requirement for institutions that have $100 million or less in aggregate assets. 
   I want to share with the Senate the reaction of banks from my home State that have been contacted about this. And this is their information. This is not some professor at some university. This is the everyday banker doing business in the everyday community. And I will go beyond simply quoting the letters because I want to put it in context so you can understand the market. 
   I have said around here before--and undoubtedly in the spirit of the Senate where there is no such thing as repetition--I will say, again, that if I could control what we engrave in the marble around here to remind us of our duty--not to denigrate the marvelous phrases  that are here--I would have engraved in stone, at least in our committee rooms, the phrase: ``You cannot repeal the law of supply and demand.'' 
   We try to do that continually in Congress. We try to think that markets do not matter, that governments are smarter than markets, that governments can make decisions that interfere with the law of supply and demand and produce beneficial results with no side effects. People have been trying to do that in government not only for centuries but for millennia. And they always fail. 
   Here are the market realities with respect to CRA. 
   I first quote from a letter of the Cache Valley Bank. No one in this Chamber knows where Cache Valley is; but I know where Cache Valley is. I have spent a lot of time there. My family has done business there. We have owned a business there. The president of the Cache Valley Bank says in his letter:  
   Our community is a middle class farming community with a university. Most all of our customers are of modest income, small businesses and small farms. The rich professionals have gravitated to the local credit unions where they know they can get something for nothing.  
   That last sentence indicates how he feels about the competitive impact of credit unions in Cache Valley. 
   He says:  
   We are chartered to serve our community. We have no business going outside our community. We live off the ability to say we are a hometown institution.  
   Let me underscore that last sentence again. ``We live off the ability to say we are a hometown institution.'' 
   In Cache Valley, there are branches of large banks, large banks that are located someplace else. There are, as an earlier somewhat sarcastic comment indicated, credit unions. They happen to be very large credit unions. We have some of the largest credit unions in the United States in Utah because of Utah's law. There is competition in Cache Valley for the banking customer. 
   How does he deal with that competition? He says:  
   My bank is ..... a $90 million institution operating from one office .....  
   One office--so he does not have branches around the city. The credit union does. He does not have the reach of advertising that the large banks which are there as his competition do. He has one office. And he makes his living advertising himself as a hometown institution. 
   This, in marketing, is what is known as a marketing niche. He recognizes that he cannot compete with the big banks throughout the entire city. He recognizes that he has a particular niche in the market that he can fill, and he goes after it and he fills it. 
   He says:  
   We do what the CRA regulation intended us to do because it makes good sense. The documentation and time spent telling the regulators that that is what we do is just wasted by both us and the regulators. I have never had a customer come in and ask to see our CRA file.  
   Then, with the optimism that comes from every small businessman, he says:  
   As I will probably [pass] the $100 million proposed limit some day, I can see that not having to comply would give smaller institutions a slight advantage from costs they would save. The real issue is if the whole rule for community oriented institutions makes any sense. It doesn't and no one has provided any evidence that it does.  
   He is not operating in a vacuum. He is not operating in a situation where there is no credit available to anybody else if he does not serve his niche. He is operating in a highly competitive situation, and yet he is examined as if he is the only institution, and he is looked at in terms of his lending to his market niche. 
   All right. Let me go down the highway a little from Cache Valley to the First National Bank of Morgan. This is a smaller bank. This is a smaller community. The president of this bank says that they have $37 million in current assets. They serve a county, the population of which is approximately 7,000. In Utah, given our family size, a total population of 7,000 means that there are probably about 2,000 families there. I do not know how many of those are borrowers. This is a relatively small base for him to serve. 
   Once again, while it is an isolated farming community, in today's modern world there is competition there. The big banks can go after his customers on the Internet if they want. 
   They can open ATM stations or put branches there, if they want. There is a big bank just down the highway, within 20 miles of this small institution. How does he survive under these competitive conditions? He survives by serving the community. This is what he has to say:  
   Exempting our institution from CRA requirements would allow bank personnel to spend more time with our customers in developing new products rather than gathering information to satisfy CRA documentation requirements. Competition is the greatest enforcer of CRA. The delivery of financial services is a highly competitive business. If my institution is not offering free checking or mortgage loans, then my competitor down the road will be taking advantage of my financial institution's shortcomings.  
   I think he is absolutely right. In today's competitive world, you do not operate in a vacuum. If he wasn't doing his job, even though he is in a small, rural community, with Internet banking and advertising over television, the large institutions would come in. 
   It is interesting, again, referring to Utah's somewhat unique situation, in many communities where the local bank was perceived as having something of a monopoly or a free ride in the community because of the physical isolation, it was not another bank that came in to offer competition; it was a credit union, operating under Utah's credit union laws. The competition produced the kinds of challenges that competition always produces. Once again, you cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. If there was demand in that community that was not being met by the local institution, competition came in and met it. 
   Now, a little further down the highway, I want to refer to the Frontier Bank of Park City. Here the president of the bank says:  
   As president of a nonmetropolitan community bank, I am of the opinion that existing CRA regulations are largely superfluous for both my institution and its direct competitors. The fact remains that we have and will continue to lend to all segments of our community because it is good business, not because it has been defined by regulation. Additionally, the time spent documenting our community lending efforts for regulatory purposes is in itself counterproductive as we could instead redirect our energies towards additional lending and community development activities.  
   An interesting quote, Mr. President. He feels that CRA gets in the way of community developing activities that he would otherwise engage in. 
   When I first went on the Banking Committee, some 6 years ago, I had never heard of the CRA. I heard at that time institutions coming in and complaining that the CRA documentation burden was overwhelming and that CRA had become more of a documentation issue than it had been a lending issue, that if they could fill out the documents in such a way as to satisfy the regulators, it didn't matter what their lending practices were. 
   We had some testimony--I can't go back and put my hand on it now--that made it clear that CRA was failing in its purpose to produce a meaningful impact for those in need in communities where they were not getting served. 
   I am hoping that the reforms established by Secretary Rubin have begun to lift that burden and change that situation, but I am satisfied now that we have enough evidence that indicates that the vast majority of small banks with capitalization under $100 million are spending their time on CRA, filling out documents and meeting with regulators, spending their time performing the bureaucratic chores necessary to file a report, where they could be spending their time better serving their communities. 
   Therefore, I will vote to see to it that the language that was adopted in the committee report remains there. I will oppose the Bryan amendment.

   Mr. BENNETT. I want to answer some of the things the Senator has been saying here and ask him a question in that context. 
   The Senator has asked the question, why we are taking this up, and why does it matter, and is there any urgency. My question to the Senator is, is he aware of the fact that Robert Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, and Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve system, both testified before the Senate Banking Committee that this legislation was of the highest urgency and that if it did not pass as quickly as possible, the entire banking system of the United States would be adversely affected by virtue of foreign competition? Is the Senator aware of that testimony from the administration and the Federal Reserve Board?

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed the presentation by my friend from Minnesota. I return his friendship, and he is my friend. We disagree on just about everything, and we disagree about most of the things he said here today. I want to make a few comments about some of the positions he has taken before I talk about the bill. 
   As I listened to the Senator run down the litany of things he thinks we ought to solve with legislation--we ought to solve farm prices with legislation; we ought to solve preparation for school 
   with legislation; we ought to solve education, generally, with legislation; we ought to solve the amount of money people earn with legislation, and on down the list--he reminds me of a comment that I found very insightful that was made by a head of state in another country as I was visiting there. This man said to me, ``Politicians think that money comes from the budget.'' Money does not come from the budget. Money comes from the economy. If the economy doesn't work, there is no money in the budget. And if I may, Mr. President, I think that discussing financial modernization has a great deal to do with all of the issues that the Senator from Minnesota was discussing because it has to do with the health of the economy. 
   If the banking system, the financial system, and the economy does not work efficiently, if it does not work carefully and properly, the economy as a whole will suffer, the amount of tax revenue coming into the Government will suffer, and we can have all of the discussions we want about solving all of the social problems with legislation, and then we will turn around and find that the cupboard is bare. 
   It is very important that we recognize the impact of this legislation on the Nation's economy. As I said in my question to my friend from Minnesota, we heard testimony in the Banking Committee from the member of the administration most charged with focusing on this area of the economy, the Secretary of the Treasury, and with the head of the independent agency most charged with keeping the economy strong and vital, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that it was essential that we modernize our financial legislative structure in this country. 
   Why? They told us that foreign banks are coming to the United States, and as the American banks go overseas, they are competing in a different regulatory framework. They said that the American framework is outdated, it is outmoded, it is expensive, and that it gets in the way of America's ability to compete. 
   The big banks that my friend from Minnesota attacks so vigorously, the last time I checked, all paid taxes on the revenues they received. The best way to make sure that we do not get those tax revenues is to say, let us hobble those banks in their competitive structure with foreign banks. Let's see to it that they cannot compete in the same kind of atmosphere as their foreign competitors, in the name of preventing them from concentrating power, and then see how much taxes we get from those big banks. Taxes are a percentage of profits; if there are no profits, there are no taxes and there is no money in the budget to pay for all of the programs that the Senator from Minnesota wants to fund. 
   Now, he made another comment that I found fascinating, from a personal point of view. He said that, of course, the big banks don't like CRA because it forces them to do what they should be doing. He stands up for the little banks that he wants to protect from the big banks that, in his view, want to gobble them up. In my experience with this legislation, it has been exactly the reverse. The big banks have said to me: We don't much care about the CRA provisions. We have learned to live with CRA. We have learned to handle our banking practices in such a way that gets us appropriate CRA ratings. And some of the big banks have said: Don't pay any attention to the CRA amendments in this bill because we can live with them just fine. 
   No. The protest about CRA has come, ironically, given the position of the Senator from Minnesota, from the small banks, the little bank. 
   Let me give you an example that I have heard of, secondhand, but I think summarizes what we are dealing with here. I have heard of a bank in California that was opened by a group of Chinese Americans. What do you do in the marketplace when you are trying to find a niche that will allow you to survive, whether you are in the banking business, or the clothing business, or the automobile business, or whatever kind of a business? You do look around for some community that is not being served properly, and say to yourself, ``I can fill that niche.'' The oldest business advice in the world is find a need and fill it. Here were a group of  Chinese Americans who decided that other Chinese Americans for some reason or another were not getting access to the credit they needed. They found this need and they hoped they could fill it. They did. They were successful. They prospered. 
   Then comes the CRA regulators, and they said, ``Let us see your books. Let us look at your loans.'' They came back and said, ``You are only making loans to Chinese Americans. That is, you are not complying with the Community Reinvestment Act that requires you to make loans to Hispanics or African Americans or other minorities that we, the regulators, will identify and determine.'' The people at this bank said, ``Of course we are only making loans to Chinese Americans. That is what we set up to do. That is the market we set up to serve.'' ``Well, you will accept the penalties and strictures of CRA regulation if you do not go out and find statistically enough African Americans and Hispanics to meet our requirements.'' 
   This was a community that these Chinese Americans did not understand instinctively. This was the community that they were not set up to serve. Maybe you can say that it was a good kind of thing for them to reach out beyond their natural business area and start serving these other sectors, but it created a burden on this small bank, and it was a very small bank that the managers of the bank objected to. 
   In my own State of Utah, I get the same reaction. The big banks don't much care about CRA. They don't like it. They find it burdensome. But they have learned to live with it. Banks that have written in that are complaining are the little banks, and they are complaining for the same reason in the example that I have given. They feel they are serving their communities and they are being forced to try to reach beyond their natural communities to try to find somebody who can statistically qualify under CRA. 
   This is from a very small bank in Utah. The President of the bank says, ``We have and will continue to lend to all segments of our community because it has been defined by regulation. The time spent documenting our community lending efforts for regulatory purposes is in itself counterproductive, as we could instead redirect our energies toward additional lending and community development activities.'' 
   In other words, they are spending more time filling out forms for CRA than they are investing in their community. 
   Another one from a very small town in Utah, and it is surrounded by the family farmers that the Senator from Minnesota was talking about: ``Exempting our institution from CRA requirements would allow bank personnel to spend more time with our customers and developing new products rather than gathering information to satisfy CRA documentation requirements.'' 
   We will have a great deal more to say about the CRA issue, I am sure, when it comes up. I simply wanted to make those points in response to the points that were made by my friend from Minnesota, because he is very clearly talking to different people than I am talking to. He is talking to the people in the crossroads cafes. And I think that is fine. But I think when it gets to the issue of banking regulation, he might spend some time talking to people who run banks and talking to people who borrow from banks. 
   He made another point that I will talk about and then get specifically to the bill. 
   He talked about the concentration of power, and he railed at great length against corporations that he felt were destroying our democracy. ``Fewer and fewer people,'' he said--I wrote that phrase down--are controlling our economic power. 
   I want to share a statistic that I saw in the paper last week that has an interesting slant on this. 
   Back in, say, 1950--my memory is not sharp enough to give you the exact year, but it was sometime in the 1950s--the percentages of Americans who owned stock in corporations was 4 percent. Today it is over 50 percent. 
   I would say to those who, like my colleague from Minnesota, are concerned about the concentration of power in the hands of a few people, who does he think owns Citibank? Who does he think owns these corporations that he says are so terrible? They are owned by Americans. They are owned by individuals. Fifty percent of Americans now own stock, and the number is going up all the time. 
   This is one of the reasons that the class warfare arguments that we have heard around this Chamber for so long are beginning to wear thinner and thinner, because the people who own the corporations are ordinary, everyday, hard-working Americans. The days of J.P. Morgan being the controller of these institutions are over. J.P. Morgan is dead, his heirs scattered, and the controlling shareholder ownership of these corporations is in the hands of the teachers' pension fund--in the hands of ordinary people who have invested their savings in these corporations and have a stake in seeing to it that these corporations survive. That is why the class warfare arguments get thinner and thinner with each passing year. 
   We are in a sense, Mr. President, turning Karl Marx on his head. He wanted the people to own all of the means of production. That was tried in the Soviet Union in the name of the government as they attacked the terrible capitalists in the United States, and ironically it is the capitalists that are seeing to it that the people ultimately own the means of production, but they own the means of production in their own name with shares held in their own name, which they can control and which they can vote and which they can sell if they don't like what the corporation is doing. And we are getting the people's ownership of the means of production through capitalism rather than through the forced distribution of wealth that Karl Marx and his followers practiced in modern communism. 
   Having given that reaction to the political science lecture from my friend, who was once a professor of political science--I was never a professor, but I was once a student of political science, and I like to engage in these kinds of debate--I would like to say just a few words about the bill. 
   The fact that it is just a few words is a testament to the expertise of our chairman who has worked harder and more personally on a piece of legislation than any chairman I have ever seen. We have resolved the controversies in this legislation to the point where there are only a few left. The Senator from Texas has led the fight in doing that. 
   When we first started this, when I first came to the Banking Committee, the number of issues was huge and the gap between those issues was very wide. I would go out and people would ask me where we were on financial modernization. Unlike my friend from Minnesota, I did get those questions. I would go out in places where people were interested. And I would say repeatedly through my first term of service in the Senate that we were nowhere and we were not going to have financial modernization legislation, because the issues were so contentious and the gap between the two sides was so great that we were simply not going to get it done, and, quite frankly, I was not paying any attention to it for that reason. I didn't want to waste my time becoming cognizant of all of the ins and outs of these arguments when the arguments were going nowhere, and the legislation was going nowhere. 
   We made a major step towards resolving these last year when Senator D'Amato was the chairman of the committee, and we finally began to grapple with some of these issues and tried to bring them closer together. But Senator GRAMM has brought us even closer together and produced a bill on which there are now only relatively few issues in contention rather than the great many issues that were in contention 4 or 5 years ago. 
   I think that is an extraordinary achievement, not only on the part of the chairman who has led the issue, but, frankly, on the part of the committee as a whole. The fact that we are having this debate when we should have been having it a few years ago, according to those who are following the issue, demonstrates how far we have come. 
   This reminds me in some ways of the debate we had in the telecommunications bill where we had huge forces on both sides of the issue struggling, literally, for survival. We had telephone companies, cable companies, long-distance carriers, local carriers, all fighting over what would happen to their future.  
   We finally came together on a bill that virtually everybody could buy off on. They weren't happy with it, but they said they could live with it. We made a landmark step forward in telecommunications. 
   I think that analogy holds true here. Insurance companies, when I first came to the Senate, were bitter in their opposition to any kind of change that would affect them; banks were chomping at the bit for more competitive opportunities and complaining that laws passed in the 1930s were freezing them out; testimony which I have referred to from Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin indicated we are being savaged by foreign competition because our regulatory structure gets in the way; the securities industry and all the other folks, everybody agreed we needed reform but nobody could agree on the form of that reform. 
   Now we have a bill before the Senate that, however reluctantly, the insurance companies have said, ``We can live with,'' and the banks have said, ``We can live with''--the big banks and the little banks that are not usually on the same page on everything; the insurance agents and the insurance companies are not necessarily always on the same page. 
   We have reconciled these various interests now. The regulators have said they can live with this and that. There is only one major regulatory argument left, and we will do our best to work our way through that one and find a compromise. 
   The time to pass the bill is now. The moment has come when all of these forces are together. Let us not waste that moment. Let the Senate not shatter it all and say we will deal with it later. The forces of competition that led Secretary Rubin and Chairman Greenspan to speak of the urgency of this are still there and their pressures are still there. The passage of time, as we get farther and farther away from the 1930s when our present regulatory structure was put in place, is not on our side in terms of making the financial services in this country efficient, more effective, and more competitive. 
   We need this bill. We need it now. We should not lose the opportunity we have to seize the moment while there is a degree of agreement among all of the parties of the bill to get it done. 
   I salute the chairman for his personal effort in getting us where we are. I urge the Senate to pass the bill.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Financial Institutions Insolvency Improvement Act of 1999. Recognizing that the changes to our Nations' banking laws have not kept pace with changes in our capital markets, this bill would strengthen the laws that enforce and protect certain financial agreements and transactions in the event that one of the parties involved becomes insolvent. This legislation would also harmonize the treatment of financial instruments under the bankruptcy code and the banking insolvency laws. 
   The legislation that I am introducing is based largely on the recommendations made in March of 1998 by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. This same working group reiterated on April 29th of this year, in their report on hedge fund activity, that Congress should pass this legislation. However, in an effort to keep this legislation free and separate from the ongoing bankruptcy debate, I am only introducing those portions of the proposal which amend banking law. I will be chairing a hearing on this legislation on the Financial Institutions Subcommittee tomorrow morning. 
   Since the adoption of the Bankruptcy Code in 1978, Congress has recognized that certain financial market transactions qualify for different treatment in the event that one of the parties becomes insolvent. Specifically, many financial instruments are exempted from the automatic stay that is imposed on general commercial contracts during a bankruptcy proceeding. This is largely due to the fact that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), by law, becomes a trustee during any bankruptcy proceeding. 
   Mr. President, the ability to terminate, or close out and ``net'' financial products is an essential and vital part of our capital markets. Congress has recognized that participants in swap transactions should have the ability to terminate and ``net'' their swap agreements. Simply put, netting means that money payments or other obligations owed between parties with multiple contracts can be offset against each other, and one net amount can be paid by one party to the other in settlement. Cross-product netting means that parties can net out different kinds of financial contracts, such as swap agreements being offset with repurchase agreements. By eliminating the need for large fund transfers for each transaction in favor of a smaller net payment, netting allows parties to enter into multiple-transaction relationships with reduced credit and liquidity exposures to a counterparty's insolvency. 
   Many parties involved in financial transactions have entered into them for hedging purposes. My legislation encourages this type of behavior by clarifying that cross-product close-out netting should be permitted for positions in securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts, repurchase agreements and swaps. 
   For example, in certain cases, the protections for financial contracts in the bank insolvency laws have not kept pace with market evolution. Assume, for example, that Party A and Party B have two outstanding equity swaps in which the payments are calculated on the basis of an equity securities index. If Party A enter insolvency, it is not entirely clear whether Party B's contractual rights to close-out and net  would be protected by the current ``swap agreement'' definition in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. If both of the parties are ``financial institutions'' under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act or the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation EE and the swap agreements are ``netting contracts,'' then Party B might (although it is not entirely clear) be able to exercise its close-out, netting and foreclosure rights. 
   However, if one of the parties is not a ``financial institution'' or the contract does not constitute a ``netting contract'' (for example, because it is governed by the laws of the United Kingdom), then Party B could be subject, among other things, to the risk of ``cherry-picking''--the risk that Party A's receiver would assume responsibility only for the swap that currently favors Party A, leaving Party B with a potentially sizable claim against Party A (which would be undersecured because of the impairment of netting) and the risk that its foreclosure on any collateral would be blocked indefinitely. This could impair Party B's creditworthiness, which in turn could lead to its default to its counterparties. It is this sort of ``chain reaction'' that can exacerbate systemic risk in the financial markets. 
   Finally, Mr. President, it is important to recognize that the framework for the bill I am introducing was contained in S. 1301, the bankruptcy bill introduced by Senator GRASSLEY last year which passed the Senate by a vote of 97-1.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical Information Protection Act of 1999. Trying to find the right balance between legitimate uses of health care data and the need for privacy has been a very difficult road to go down; however, I feel that great progress has been made and that the legislation that I am introducing strikes the right balance between the desire the patient has for increased confidentiality and the need our health care system has for information that will enable it to provide a higher quality of care. I am pleased that Senators MACK, MURKOWSKI and SANTORUM have joined me as co-sponsors of this legislation and I am hopeful that a number of other senators will soon join us as well. In addition, I am pleased to include in the record a list of groups that have come out in support of this legislation. I am grateful for the many comments and suggestions I have received from a wide variety of organizations and individuals. 
   Most of us wrongly assume that our personal health information is protected under federal law. It is not. Federal law protects the confidentiality of our video rental records, and federal law ensures us access to information about us such as our credit history. However, there is no current federal law which will protect the confidentiality of our medical information against unauthorized use and ensure us access to that same sensitive information about us. This is a circumstance that I believe should and must change. 
   At this time, the only protection of an individual's personal medical information is under state law. These state laws, where they exist, are incomplete, inconsistent and in most cases inadequate. At last check, there were approximately 35 states with 35 unique laws governing the use and disclosure of medical information. Even in those states where there are existing laws, there is no penalty for releasing and disseminating the most private information about our 
   health and the health care we have received. 
   As our health care delivery systems continue to expand across state lines, efficiency, research advances and the delivery of the highest quality of care possible depend upon the flow of information. This year alone, a large number of states have either considered passing new legislation or have attempted to modify existing laws. As states act to meet the concerns of their residents, the patchwork of state laws become ever more complex. If this trend continues, the high quality care and research breakthroughs we have come to expect and demand from our health care system would be jeopardized because health care organizations would be forced to track and comply with multiple, conflicting and increasingly complex state laws. 
   Clearly, in today's world, health information must be permitted to flow across state lines if we are to expect the highest level of health care. For example, in Utah, Intermountain Health Care (IHC), the largest care provider based in my state also provides care in four other western states. IHC currently maintains secure databases of patient information which each of its member facilities in Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming draw upon to provide and improve care. Requiring them to comply with multiple state laws does not add to the quality of health care they provide, but does add to the cost of health care they provide. Many IHC patients live in one state yet their closest hospital, clinic or physicians office is in another state. I am sure this example appears throughout the country in one form or another given the consolidation of the health care industry and the large percentage of us who live near state lines. 
   In addition, we are seeing an emergence of telemedicine and health care services over the internet that adds another degree of complexity to this entire circumstance. Technology is not only improving the quality of care and improving patient access to services, it is also making the need for one strong federal law more critical. The majority of providers, insurers, health care professionals, researchers and patients agree that there is an increasingly urgent need for uniformity in our laws that govern access to and disclosure of personal health information. 
   Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that if we do not act by August of 1999 the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to put in to place regulations governing health information in an electronic format. Thus, we could have a circumstance where paper based records and electronic based records are treated differently. I do not believe Congress wants to protect one form of medical records and not another, and I do not think that we should permit the Secretary of Health and Human Services to implement regulations without further direction from the Congress. Congress should not neglect its responsibility and duty to legislate and provide appropriate direction to the executive branch. I urge my colleagues to work with me to pass legislation that would give HHS clear direction and provide each American with greater protection of their health information.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Bill Lamb upon his retirement for his thirty-six years of dedicated service with the Bureau of Land Management. Mr. Lamb retired on April 2, 1999 after four successful years as BLM's State Director in Utah. 
   As native Utahn, Bill Lamb began to work for the BLM in 1963 at the age of 22. A graduate of Utah State University, he served in a number of positions varying from a range conservationist, Director of the Arizona Strip to a budget official here in Washington. For the last four years Bill has served as the Utah State BLM Director. I know that I speak for all of the members of the Utah delegation when I say that it has been a privilege to work with him. 
   I have watched Bill perform with grace under pressure, always dealing with the contentious land management issues in Utah with an even-hand and a listening ear. His well-deserved reputation for always being honest and candid helped sooth over the hard feelings and frayed nerves brought on by the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. He was instrumental in the successful completion of the historic Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998 which traded State Trust lands locked up in the Grand Staircase for other federal lands in Utah. 
   Bill worked to preserve important wildlife habitat and at the same time, increased public participation through the creation of the Washington County Desert Tortoise Habitat Conservation Plan and the reestablishment of the citizens' advisory board. He always strived to maintain a balance between conservation and utilization and in the process earned a reputation for being one of the most able and affable leaders within BLM. I will miss his valuable advice and perspective tremendously. 
   Secretary Babbitt said: ``Bill Lamb has done a remarkable job in one of the most demanding positions in the BLM.'' I could not agree more. I thank Bill for his service that was at many times thankless. He will be sorely missed. I wish him great success in his future endeavors.

    Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to recognize an exceptionally special event that occurred yesterday, April 19, 1999. John Stephenson, Deputy Staff Director for the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 (Y2K) Technology Problem, and his wife welcomed the arrival of Eric Tyler, the newest member of the Stephenson family. Eric arrived yesterday at 11:53 a.m. weighing in at a healthy 6 pounds 15 ounces and measuring 19 inches long. I am extremely pleased to offer my sincere congratulations to John, Penny, and Eric's older sister, Kaitlyn. 
   I must say that the staff leadership within the Y2K committee has been a prolific one. Late last year on September 17, 1998, Robert Cresanti, Committee Staff Director, and Colleen, his wife, introduced Katja Maria, their first-born child, who arrived measuring 20.5 inches and a hearty 8 pounds 10 ounces. This is an excellent opportunity to express my personal heartfelt congratulations to Robert and Colleen. 
   As I ponder these events, I wonder if there is any connection to the fact that we now have another member of the committee professional staff that is expecting their third child. You might question if the due date is targeted for January 1, 2000. I will tell you that at this point, the expected delivery date is much earlier, November 26th. We will anxiously await yet another addition to the committee staff's offspring.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to note a significant event in the life of a native son of Utah and for those of us here in Washington. After working for over thirty years in government and private service, Anthony T. Cluff is leaving the leadership role he has held at one of the preeminent trade groups in Washington, The Bankers Roundtable. 
   Few individuals have contributed so much to this city. 
   Tony worked as an economist at the Treasury Department and later with the American Bankers Association and the Securities Industry Association. Then he spent 8 years on Capitol Hill as a member of the Senate Banking Committee staff and served several years as Minority Staff Director under Senator John Tower of Texas. He also served as a staff member to my father here in the Senate. 
   For nearly two decades he has steered the association that represents the nation's leading banks--The Bankers Roundtable and its predecessor, the Association of Reserve City Bankers. During his tenure, he has elevated the prominence of the group, enhanced its message and provided his members with important professional guidance. Under his leadership, the Roundtable expanded its range of activities and took leadership roles in interstate banking legislation, payments system regulation, environmental liability reforms and addressing the challenges of new technology for the banking industry. Most of all, Tony imparted to the association and its staff his values of hard work, doing what is right and speaking the truth; these values are reflected in the approaches that the association takes in working with government. 
   Tony Cluff was born in Logan, Utah, and has maintained his ties to Utah despite spending most of his time in Washington. For though he has many responsibilities here, many of his family and friends remain in Utah and the West. 
   With long service to his country and to the industry he has represented, Tony is leaving The Bankers Roundtable to pursue other interests that will afford him more time to write, to be with his children and grandchildren and to enjoy life a bit more. He leaves his work ``on top,'' with an unblemished record and with the knowledge that there are many in this city and throughout the country indebted to him. 
   I want to wish Tony and his family the very best and express my thanks for all that he has done.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I had not thought to address this subject, but the opportunity presents itself here and I find that I have reactions to this morning's newspaper that I would like to share with the Senate. 
   There were two things that happened yesterday, both of which are reported in this morning's paper. I think they come together with an interesting connection. The first one was a briefing held here in this building, on the fourth floor, on the issue of Kosovo and what the United States is about to do there. Attending that briefing, appropriately reported in this morning's paper, were the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, the President's National Security Adviser and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Basically, they told us we are on the brink of going to war; that is, that the United States is prepared, with its  NATO allies, to attack a country within its own borders to resolve a dispute among its own people in a way that the United States feels is appropriate. 
   There are those who have advised us to stay out of a civil war, not go in the borders of another sovereign nation in order to resolve the dispute within that nation. But let us assume the stakes here are high enough to justify disregarding that advice. The second piece of advice that we are given is, if you do go into a civil war, pick a side. It is not entirely clear to me, from attending the briefing, that we know exactly which side we are for and what outcome we want. Because the third advice that comes along is, if you are going to go into a civil war and you are going to pick a side, make sure it is going to win. Again, in the briefing we had yesterday I was not satisfied that those four representatives of the administration had demonstrated a compelling case. 
   But I do not rise to issue a challenge to them on those grounds. Instead, I rise because of the connection, as I say, between two events: No. 1, a briefing of the Senate of the United States on the eve of the United States committing an act of war; and, No. 2, a report as to what the President of the United States was doing last night. In this morning's newspaper we are told that the President conducted a boffo performance before a dinner made up of representatives of the press, that he received three standing ovations, and in the Style section of the Washington Post we are told some of his best one liners. This is why I find such a jarring disconnect between the President preparing one liners in the White House for a reporters' dinner and the President's advisers talking to the Senate about going to war. 
   During the briefing that we had in this building yesterday, prior to the United States committing an act of war, we were told that one of the reasons we had to go ahead with this action was because we had gone so far down the road, in consultation with our allies, it would damage our treaty obligations with our allies if we did not proceed. I must confess I was offended--indeed, perhaps outraged by that logic--not because of what it said about what the administration had done with respect to our allies, but because of what it said about what the administration had not done with respect to its constitutional responsibilities. In the Constitution of the United States, the power to declare war is vested in the Congress of the United States. 
   Very clearly, very specifically, without equivocation, Congress shall declare war. 
   We are on the verge of actions that are the equivalent of the United States going to war. The justification we are receiving for taking those warlike actions is that the administration has made commitments to foreign governments. Why is the administration entering into conversations, consultations and other relationships with foreign governments about going to war and not talking to the Congress of the United States about going to war, instead, preparing one liners for a dinner with members of the press so the President can get standing ovations for his comedic abilities, the President competing with Bob Hope and David Letterman, while the United States is on the verge of sending its young men and women into harm's way in a situation which, according to the President's advisers, will ``take casualties''? 
   The phrase, ``we will take casualties,'' is a euphemism to say that Americans are going to be killed. They are going to come home in body bags, and they will be killed in a war that Congress has not declared. They will be killed in a war that takes place because the administration has consulted with our allies and is worried about embarrassing themselves with our allies but cannot bother to bring themselves to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to come to the one agency that, under the Constitution, has the authority to declare war--that is, the Congress of the United States. 
   Indeed, in that briefing we were told that American forces will face the most serious challenge militarily that we have faced since the gulf war, and some said the most serious air defenses we would face since the Second World War. Yet the administration does not bother to talk to Congress about this and gain congressional authority for these actions. Instead, the administration spends its time talking to our allies. 
   Don't make any mistake, I am not objecting to the fact that the administration has consulted with our allies. I think that is right and proper that we should do that. Don't they have any sense of proportion or constitutional responsibility in this White House? Don't they understand that the Constitution says Congress has the right to declare war, not the President? 
   The last time we went into major military confrontation was over the gulf war. At that time, the White House was in the hands of a Republican President. That Republican President, whom I consider a good personal friend and for whom I have the highest affection, was going down this same road. He was preparing to take America to war without a congressional authorization to do so. There were those in this body who stood and said, ``Mr. President, you cannot take us to war without the approval of Congress.'' 
   President Bush and his advisers resisted that logic for a while. Interestingly enough, one of the Senators who spoke out most vigorously, saying to the President you have no right to take us to war without congressional authorization, is now the Secretary of Defense. Then-Senator Cohen said repeatedly, to his own administration and his own party, you cannot take us to war without congressional authorization. 
   I am delighted and pleased that ultimately President Bush came to realize that truth and that America did not go to war in the gulf without congressional authority. President Bush had made all of the same kinds of commitments to allies that we now hear that President Clinton has made to our NATO allies with 
   respect to Kosovo. It would have been enormously embarrassing for President Bush had the Congress not approved his action. He risked that embarrassment because he recognized his constitutional responsibilities. He came to Congress. The vote was close. He ran the risk of losing that vote, but ultimately, the Congress approved America's going ahead with the gulf war. We went ahead with the gulf war. 
   Yes, we did take casualties, but we set a precedent that is in concert with the constitutional responsibilities that we all face. America could say we went to war with the proper constitutional authorization. 
   I fear we are on the verge of going to war without the proper constitutional authorization. I fear the President of the United States, because of his concern--if we can believe what we were told in the Capitol briefing yesterday--over our relationship with our allies, is not willing to risk his constitutional responsibility to come to Congress. 
   I wish that instead of perfecting his one liners for the correspondents dinner last night, the President had been working on a message to Congress. I wish the President of the United States would come before a joint session of the Congress and explain to us what vital national interests are at stake here and why it is necessary for the United States to consider attacking another sovereign nation. 
   Obviously, he must feel the reasons are compelling or he would not have gone so far down the road as he has already gone. Let him share those compelling reasons with the people of the United States. Obviously, he feels he has a case to make or he would not have pilots standing at the ready to begin bombing. Let him make that case before the Congress of the United States. Let him recognize that when he took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, similar to the oath that we took, he cannot ignore the phrase in the Constitution that says that Congress has the right to declare war, not the President. It could not be clearer. 
   The difference in the President's priorities could not be clearer. Instead of preparing a message to Congress, he was preparing comedic one liners for a correspondents dinner. 
   Do my colleagues know what one of those one liners was, Mr. President? It is one of the things that offended me the most, reading the paper this morning. He referred to the fact that the vote in the Senate on the impeachment trial had acquitted him and said, ``If it had gone the other way, I wouldn't be here tonight.'' Then the appropriate  comedic pause, and he said, ``I demand a recount.'' Laughter. 
   Mr. President, I suggest, in the strongest terms I can muster, that the President should not be making light of the dangers of his appearing before a group of correspondents while his administration is in the process of preparing to send young Americans to their death. Flying over Kosovo with the air defenses that are embedded in those mountains firing at you is more dangerous than appearing before a group of correspondents who might write nasty columns about you. For the President to joke about the hazards of his appearing before that dinner on the eve of sending Americans into harm's way, where we are certainly going to see some of them come home in body bags, is to me deeply offensive. 
   Mr. President, I conclude with what is obvious about my position. The President of the United States has a constitutional duty before he sends Americans to war to come to 
   the Congress of the United States and get some form of declaration of war. I believe he will abrogate his constitutional duty and violate his oath if he does not do that. Without his coming to us and without our adopting constitutionally accurate support for his actions, I will vote against everything that he proposes to do, against the appropriations. 
   I will vote in every way I can to say the President of the United States has violated his oath and violated the Constitution if he proceeds in the manner that we were informed about in our briefings yesterday. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I can't pass up the opportunity to embarrass BOB KERREY. I know, as we all do, that he did not ask for this and that it is always uncomfortable to come to your own wake, but he deserves it. I want to participate in it and do what I can to not only add to his embarrassment a little, but to let him know how well regarded he is on both sides of the aisle and among those who may disagree with him on all of the great issues that the minority leader just listed. 
   I served in the military at a time when the only shots I ever heard fired were in basic training. After I got out of basic training, I ended up in classroom and spent my time trying to teach surveying to a group of draftees who didn't understand what the word meant. The only reason I was doing that is because my particular military specialty, for which I was being 
   trained, was being phased out in the way the military always does. They train you for an obsolete skill and then make you an instructor to teach that skill to other people who do not need it. 
   I have absolutely no basis for identifying with the group, the very small group of people who have heard shots fired in anger, who have faced the difficulty and the challenge of combat. I can only read about it. I can only hear about it. I cannot identify with it in any personal way. 
   So why am I taking the time to stand here and talk about the contribution of BOB KERREY when everyone who has had those kinds of experiences has talked about it? I am standing because of an experience I had 2 years ago--3 years ago now--with the former majority leader, Bob Dole. I was on the campaign trail with Senator Dole, and we were out making the usual kinds of stops. I was told our next stop was in Battle Creek, MI. Battle Creek, MI, to me means breakfast cereal. I had no idea why Senator Dole wanted to go to Battle Creek, MI. 
   We went into a building in Battle Creek, a Federal building. It was under renovation, but the lobby had not been renovated. I felt as if I had walked into a movie set. It was the 1940s all over again. This building, being renovated into a Federal office building, had been a Federal hospital. It was the hospital where Bob Dole spent, on and off, 3 years of his life. They had found the place--that is, the floor--where Bob Dole's bed had been when he was taken there in a condition where he could do nothing for himself. He couldn't brush his teeth himself. He certainly couldn't go to the bathroom for himself. He was just taken there and placed in a bed and left there, as they began to work on him. 
   We walked around the floor. As I say, it was being renovated. Finally, Senator Dole identified the place on that floor where his bed had been. He stood there and said, ``Yep, that's the view out of the window; that's where the bathroom was, where I would be wheeled,'' so on, so forth. ``Okay, let's go.'' 
   It was the working press that said, ``Wait a minute, Senator. Don't leave. Tell us how you feel.'' 
   Probably for the first time in public, Bob Dole told us what it was like in a military hospital without any prospects, without any immediate hope, completely paralyzed by his condition. The thing that struck me the most and the thing that brings me to my feet today was his description of some of the other things that happened in that war. 
   He said, catching me completely by surprise, ``Over there was where Phil Hart had his bed.'' 
   And he said, ``Over there''--or maybe it was down the hall--``was DANNY INOUYE.'' He said, ``Phil wasn't hurt as badly as the rest of us, so he could get out from time to time. The Hart family owned a hotel down the street, and he would go down to the hotel and get some decent food for us and smuggle it in so that we didn't have the hospital food all the time.'' 
   He said, ``DANNY INOUYE was the best bridge player in the whole hospital.''  Subsequent to that, I talked to Senator INOUYE on the subway and said, ``I understand you were the best bridge player in the hospital in Battle Creek.'' He said, ``Oh, no, I wasn't very good; it's just that Dole was terrible.'' 
   Then Bob Dole said, ``As I got a little better, they began to move my bed around the hospital, because I could tell jokes and I would cheer some of the others up.'' 
   Why do I bring this up? Of course, we all know Bob Dole. We have named a building after Phil Hart. I don't know what we will name after DANNY INOUYE, but he is still here. I bring this up with respect to BOB KERREY because we honor these men not solely for what they did in the military, not solely for what they did to rebuild their bodies, but for the example they set to rebuild their lives. To me, that is more heroic than the instant in battle when your instincts take over and you do what your duty tells you you have to do. I say that without ever having been there. So I could well be wrong. 
   But how much heroism is involved in pulling yourself together when you are lying in a bed unable to brush your own teeth and say, ``I'm going to rebuild my body, I'm going to rebuild my life, I'm going to go to law school or found a restaurant,'' or do whatever it is that has to be done to such an extent that you are qualified in the eyes of the voters in the State in which you live to represent them in the U.S. Senate. 
   We are surrounded by heroes, not just because of what they did while under enemy fire, but what they did in the years following when they gave our children and our contemporaries the example of never giving up, of never allowing what happened to them to destroy them. Bob Dole was such a hero; Phil Hart was such a hero; DANNY INOUYE, JOHN MCCAIN, MAX CLELAND, and BOB KERREY. 
   I will never join the select group of people who receive military honors or military medals, but I am proud to be part of the select group that knows and works with these heroes, these men who have demonstrated to us that what you do over a lifetime is many times more important than what you do in an instant, and BOB KERREY stands at the first rank of that select group, and I salute him.

   Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   As I have said somewhat facetiously, today is ``Y2K Day in the neighborhood.'' We have had a series of events with respect to Y2K legislation, starting with the debate this morning on the Small Business Administration bill offered by Senator BOND of Missouri. We then went into a closed session where it was my privilege, along with Senator DODD, to make a presentation to Members of the Senate with respect to the impact of Y2K on our national defense and our intelligence capabilities. And now this afternoon, we have 3 hours to discuss the funding request for the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problems and, in that process, take the opportunity of the debate to lay out for the Senate and for the television public exactly what we are dealing with. 
   To summarize ``Y2K in the neighborhood,'' I have a single chart that we used in the press conference earlier that outlines what it is we are talking about. 
   Specifically, as you see, Mr. President, it says, ``Y2K--What is it?'' There are some who think it is a rock band and we will make that clear. And then, Why are we vulnerable? Where are the greatest risks? What is being done? What should we be doing next? And what can we expect? It is in the framework of those questions that I will be making my presentation today. 
   In the closed session, we talked about national defense issues, international assessments country by country and the preparedness of the U.S. intelligence community. I report to the Senate as a whole, for those Senators who were not able to be there, that we announced these conclusions to the Senators who were there and, I might say, Mr. President, we were very gratified by the number of Senators who did appear. The room was full, and the Senators were very attentive, which I think is appropriate given the significance of this issue. 
   We believe that there is a low-to-medium probability of exploitation of Y2K by any terrorist groups. People in the press conference asked me, ``Well, can you be specific?'' And the answer is no. We know of no intention on the part of terrorist groups to exploit Y2K uncertainty, but these groups are there, they are up to mischief, and so we say there is a probability, but it is at the low end of things. 
   There is a low probability of a nuclear launch coming by accident as a result of Y2K. Again, we cannot rule it out absolutely, but we think the probability of it is very low. 
   There is a medium probability of economic disruptions that could lead to civil unrest in various parts of the world, and we will discuss that here in the open session as we outline for you how vulnerable some parts of the world may be to Y2K interruptions.  
   There is a high probability of an economic impact with consequences unknown. Here we can only guess, but I think there is a high probability that Y2K will, in fact, produce some kind of economic dislocation that we will feel. 
   As far as U.S. preparedness is concerned, the U.S. Armed Forces will not lose their mission-critical capability, their war-fighting capacity. The United States will remain the world's superpower, and the U.S. intelligence community will not lose its capability to carry out its duties. 
   To go to, first, the question--What is Y2K?--in case there is anyone who really doesn't understand what we are talking about here, it goes to the inability of a computer to recognize the difference between 1900 and 2000 as a date if that computer is programmed for only two digits for the date field for years. This goes back to the 1960s, maybe even the 1950s when memory space was very, very expensive, very, very crucial and, in order to save space, programmers said, ``Well, we can just drop the ``19'' off the year and go to ``69'' for 1969, ``70'' for 1970, and so on. And when someone said, ``Well, what happens when you get to the year 2000 and you get two zeros and the computer will think it is 1900?'' The answer on the part of those programmers was, ``This program will be obsolete and abandoned long before we get to the year 2000.'' 
   They didn't realize the ingenuity of programmers. They figured out a way to preserve those ancient programs and to lay other layers of programming on top of them in such a fashion that the old programs look like the new ones, but deep down in the bowels of all of that programming, you have programs that are scheduled to fail when they get to the crucial time when they go over from 99 to 00. 
   There are many other manifestations of it, going down to embedded chips, computers no bigger than my little fingernail that nonetheless have in them the capacity to fail over this issue. But basically that is the issue. That is what Y2K is. The failure of computers, when they have to transition from 1999 to 2000, those computers that are programmed with two digits for the annual date may fail--some of them certainly will fail--and that is what Y2K is all about. 
   By the way, people ask, What does ``Y2K'' stand for? ``Y'' stands for year, ``2'' stands for 2--that is fairly easy to follow--and ``K,'' from the Greek, standing for kilo, meaning 1,000. It is computer speech for the year 2000. My wife says to me, ``Why do you use that acronym? You just confuse people. Why don't you say `year 2000' instead of `Y2K.' '' And I say, ``Well, it's quicker.'' She says, `` `Y2K,' `year 2000,' you only save one syllable. What is the point? You just do it to confuse people.'' But I guess I have been in Government long enough now that confusing people is part of the program. 
   So what is Y2K? I think that is the answer to the question. 
   Why are we vulnerable? We are vulnerable because at virtually every point of importance in the modern economy and modern activity there stands the computer--whether it is on a chip or in a huge mainframe--with the capacity to fail. 
   Let's take an event that we hope never happens to any of us, but that is a demonstration of a true emergency--a fire in a building--and see what happens. Here is a picture of a burning building. 
   In order to muster the firefighting capability to deal with this emergency, you have a number of people and a number of systems that are involved. There is the computer-aided dispatching system to send the firefighter to where the challenge is. There is the telecommunications system where the telephone calls go back and forth to send the message from the dispatching system; the building security and fire detection systems that make the phone call back to the dispatching system. 
   The firefighters jump in their cars or their trucks. The trucks have to be filled with fuel. And the pumps that control the fuel supply that goes into the firetrucks all have computers in them--embedded chips. The traffic control system that controls the ability of the fire engine to get through town all has computers in it. The water supply, when they get to the hydrant, is regulated by computers. And, of course, the personnel management systems that get the firefighters into the fire station in the first place now are all managed by computers. 
   A single event we take for granted, all of the things that are done to bring to bear on this event--some firefighting capability, but there are computers at virtually every step of the way. 
   Now, just another example of how interconnected we are in this world. Let's take a single transaction that takes place this time across international lines. This will be, perhaps, a little hard to follow because the chart is relatively smaller and less dramatic than a burning building, but just let me walk you through this as to what happens when there is a commercial transaction that goes across national lines. 
   An import-export kind of transaction. Every red arrow that you see there on the chart, Mr. President, is a transmission of information by computer. Every single time something takes place with the purchase and delivery of an item across national lines --you start the contracts, the negotiations by the Internet, a checking of credit, the contract by the Internet--all the way through. The white arrows on the chart are where something physically moves, when you are moving a piece of merchandise out of a factory onto a ship or out of the truck into a retail store or whatever. 
   Without going through all of the steps, I just point out that there are more red arrows than there are white ones. There are more opportunities for computer failure to ruin the ability of this transaction to go forward than there are physical opportunities for it to fail. We are so heavily interconnected in this world now that we are completely vulnerable to a computer failure. And at every red arrow on that chart right now there is a computer with a potential Y2K problem. 
   Someone once said to me, This problem is really very simple. You just get into the computer and find out where the date is and fix it; change it from two digits to four digits. And I say, yes, that is very simple, very simple problem, very simply solved. The only problem is, you do not know where that date field is, particularly in those old programs that I talked about. 
   It has been likened to this kind of a challenge: Suppose someone said to you, Mr. President, the Golden Gate Bridge has some bad rivets in it, and if you do not replace those faulty rivets, the Golden Gate Bridge will fall down. All you have to do is very simple: Knock out the bad rivet, put in a good rivet, and the bridge is made secure. 
   Now, one out of seven of those rivets in the Golden Gate Bridge is bad, and we cannot tell you which ones they are. You 
   have to go through the Golden Gate Bridge and check every rivet to see which seventh rivet has to be fixed. And by the way, if you do not get every single one, the bridge will collapse, and you do this remediation work at rush hour while the bridge is being used. That is roughly comparable to the challenge that we face here. And that is why we are vulnerable. OK. 
   The next question is, Where are the greatest risks? Well, we can answer that two ways. On our committee, we have decided to rate the greatest risks in terms of which sectors of the economy have the greatest importance to us. And when you rank risk by importance, No. 1 immediately leaps to the top of the list; and that is power. 
   If the power goes off, it does not matter if your computer works otherwise. The only computers that will work in the world, if the power goes off, will be those that have batteries, and that is about 2 or 3 hours, and they are all gone. So we have put our first focus on power. 
   Second, telecommunications. If the telephone goes off, the power grid fails, because many of the signals that keep the power grid functioning go over telephone lines. So once again, everything stops. 
   Third, transportation. If transportation fails, you cannot get coal, for example, from coal mines into power-generating plants. If the switches on all of the railroad lines fail--and they are controlled by computers--there is no coal in the powerplants. The power grid fails, everything fails. 
   You begin to see, again, how interconnected everything is. 
   Fourth, finance. If the banks cannot clear checks, if there can be no transfer of funds, if the financial system collapses, then business collapses. Once  again, the chain starts, and you end up ultimately with no power, all the rest of it. 
   Then, general government. We are so dependent on government services to keep the economy running that if the general government services were to fail--in the Federal Government, for example, if the Health Care Financing Administration were to fail and be unable to make any Medicare reimbursements, it would ultimately destroy the health care industry, because 40 percent of the health care reimbursements are Medicare reimbursements. And you simply could not keep a health care facility going if you cut their cash by 40 percent and left it that way for a while. 
   Finally, general business. 
   Those are the ranks of importance that we have looked at in our committee. 
   Let me take this opportunity to make this statement about what we found. The committee has been operating for roughly a year now, and in that process people who have looked at the list I have just recited have gotten very excited. Indeed, they have begun to create a cottage industry of panic. 
   You can get on the Internet and you can look up any kind of web site, and they will take the possibility of computer failure in any of the areas I have just outlined and translate that into what has come to be known in the world of Y2K hyperbole as TEOTWAWKI. Now, TEOTWAWKI is the acronym that stands for ``The End Of The World As We Know It.'' They use that phrase so often, they created an acronym. Now you can get on the Internet and they will talk about TEOTWAWKI. 
   Mr. President, I am here to announce that TEOTWAWKI is not going to come to pass. We are satisfied, as a result of the hearings we held, and the interviews we held, and the investigations we have undertaken on the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, that the world is not, in fact, going to come to an end over this problem--certainly not in the United States. We will have problems. There is no question, given the ubiquitous nature of the problem, that it will cause interruptions and difficulties in the United States, but it will not bring everything to a halt. It will not cause the shutdown of vital services. In our opinion, it will be a bump in the road for the United States. 
   Now, people say: What does that mean? How serious a bump and how long will it last, Senator BENNETT? I don't know, and I don't know anybody who does, because this is a moving target, there are so many potentials for challenge, that we cannot quantify it with the kind of accuracy that the press always searches for when they ask you these questions. It will have an impact. It will be felt. But how long it will last and how deep it will go I don't know. That is why the committee is going to continue, so that we can continue to study it, and as we get closer to it, we will be in a better position to make that kind of assessment. 
   Now, if we ask the question, Where are the greatest risks? --not in the pattern of the impact on the economy that I have talked about, but on our current state of readiness--we find that the greatest impact, based on what we now know in the committee, is probably going to be in the health care field. This is the field that we think is the least prepared to deal with the year 2000 problem in the United States. 
   One of the reasons for that is it so fragmented. There are so many hospitals. There are so many separate doctors' offices. Some of them have done nothing to prepare for the year 2000. Frankly, some of them can solve their problem in an afternoon. Some of them that are operating off of a single PC can get a patch downloaded from the Internet that can solve their problem. Some of them are going to require substantially more than that. And some of them, frankly, are far enough behind the curve, if they are not on top of it by now, it is too late and they ought to start thinking about contingency plans. We simply do not know. What we do know causes us to believe that health care is vulnerable. 
   Senator DODD, I am sure, will be addressing this in greater detail because he is the one who has focused on this to a greater extent than any other member of the committee. 
   Another area of readiness that we are concerned about is local government. I gave this Y2K speech at a Rotary Club meeting in a small town in Utah and people asked me, ``What should we do to get ready for Y2K?'' I gave them the same answer I always give them, which is, you should take charge of your own life; you should check with your own bank to make sure they are going to be Y2K compliant; you should check with your own 
   employer to be sure he or she is getting things under control; and, among other things, I said, call your mayor to make sure your water system is going to be all right in your local community. 
   I have done that in Salt Lake City. I have had some long discussions with the mayor of Salt Lake, and she assures me it will be safe for me to be in Salt Lake on New Year's Eve because the water system will work. 
   After I gave the speech, a man came up, shook my hand, and said, ``You have caused me some problems.'' I asked why, and he said, ``I am the mayor.'' I said, ``Mr. Mayor, is your water system going to be all right?'' He said, ``I don't have the slightest idea but I am sure going to find out.'' He said, ``It never occurred to me that we had computer problems in our water purification plant.'' 
   We have held hearings on this issue. I have been in a water purification plant. While I think most local governments are responsible enough and will be on top of it, I am concerned that there will be local governments where there will be critical emergency response systems that will fail--fire departments, ambulances, and so on, water systems, federally funded services. Many of the federally funded services are administered at the local level. Welfare checks are mailed out by county governments, not by the Federal Government, in many instances. And in these communities, there can be serious disruption even while the Nation as a whole is doing fine. 
   In the economy as a whole, the area that is at the greatest risk is where we find medium-sized businesses. The big businesses are probably just fine. Citigroup announced when we first got into this they were going to spend $500 million fixing their year 2000 problem. That went up to $650 million by the time we got around to drafting the report. Now, the day the report is issued, we are told they are spending closer to $800 million to get this solved. But Citigroup will get it solved. They have the money and the muscle and the will to get it taken care of. 
   The very small businesses will probably get it solved because, again, for them, they are dealing with a single computer that runs their payroll and maybe does their taxes, and they do everything else by hand. They can solve that problem in a short-term period of time. The middle-sized businesses that don't have the money of a Citigroup and that have a much bigger problem than a mom-and-pop store are running into difficulty. The surveys we are conducting tell us that these companies are where the problems are going to be. 
   Now you may say, so what? We should really care if an individual business here or an individual business there should fail or should have serious problems. In today's economy, we live in a world of outsourcing and just-in-time inventory. That means that General Motors has literally tens of thousands of suppliers. General Motors does not make everything themselves; they outsource. That is a fancy name for buying it from somebody else. They are dependent on these medium-sized businesses for their parts. One of the scary things is that many of these medium-sized businesses on which General Motors and other big manufacturers are dependent are overseas. 
   I used to run a very small business, so small that it wouldn't really attract anybody's attention, but the key component of our business, without which we had no product, was manufactured in Taiwan, and if we were unable to get that from Taiwan because of Y2K problems in Taiwan, we were out of business. We sold our product to a much bigger company. They were dependent upon us. They could have all of their computers Y2K compliant and be unable to get product from us and therefore have to drop a major product line for them. We couldn't supply it because we couldn't get this product from Taiwan. You see the chain of suppliers that runs throughout the economy in this just-in-time inventory world. 
   When I say I am concerned about medium-sized firms as an area of high  risk, it could affect big firms and could affect the economy as a whole. 
   Now, the next question after where is the greatest risk: What are we doing about it? What is being done? Here, I think, it is time for the Senate and the Congress, if I might, to be a little bit self-congratulatory. When this problem first came to the attention of the Congress, Senator BURNS of Montana has said he held hearings on this issue, or had been involved in hearings on this issue back in the early 1990s. He said we couldn't get anybody interested; nobody paid any attention. He was on the Commerce Committee. He said the thing just kind of dropped without a trace. 
   We first became aware of this on the Senate Banking Committee in 1996. That is where Senator DODD and I became zealots on this issue, 
   and we began to work on this with respect to the financial services area. The more we got into that, the more we realized that it encompassed all of the things that I have described here this afternoon. 
   One example demonstrates what I am talking about when I say that Congress can be a little bit self-congratulatory about the question of what is being done. My son-in-law works for one of the major banks in this country. He said at a family gathering, ``You know, I don't know what's happened, but the bank examiners from the Federal Reserve who come into our bank now have only one thing on their minds, and that is Y2K, and they have made it the top priority in the bank.'' I thought, you know, we have finally done something in Congress that has produced a result because, at Senator DODD's suggestion, we got the bank regulators before our subcommittee of the Banking Committee and we raised this issue with them; we discovered several things. No. 1, they were not raising it as part of the safety and soundness examination they were doing in banks. No. 2, their own computers weren't going to work in the year 2000. They would not be able to conduct their regulatory activities if we didn't get it fixed. The mere act of holding a hearing and bringing these people forward produced a salutary result that actually got out into the economy and changed the way things are being done. 
   Well, now, I think we can take some credit for having raised that alarm. Senator MOYNIHAN wrote to the President and urged him to appoint a Y2K czar or coordinator. The President did not respond. I wrote to the President after we had our hearings in the Banking Committee and recommended it. He did not respond to me, either. But in February of 1998, he did, in fact, appoint a Y2K coordinator. I think the track record says it is the Congress that possibly spurred that. And we now have a President's Council on the Year 2000 Conversion, headed by John Koskinen, working very diligently to make sure the Federal Government and the economy as a whole is ready for this. We are doing everything we can to create awareness of the challenge. At the same time, we want to be sure, in words that we have used before, that while we are ``Paul Revere,'' we are not ``Chicken Little.'' We have to get everybody aroused to the fact that the British really are coming. They have to get out of their warm beds and pick up their muskets and get ready for this; but the sky is not falling and it will not be TEOTWAWKI; it will not be the end of the world as we know it. 
   Well, I see that the vice chairman of our committee, Senator DODD, has come on to the floor. Soon I will reserve the remainder of my time and give him an opportunity for a statement about this. 
   Other members of the committee have expressed an interest to come to the floor and talk about this issue. I want to acknowledge the tremendous support we have had on this committee. This is a unique kind of committee in that we have had tremendous bipartisan support. My staff and Senator DODD's staff function almost as one on this committee. We have made every effort to keep any kind of partisanship out of it. We go out on field visits together. Senator DODD has been indefatigable in his effort to keep this thing going, and he prods me in areas where I need it and keeps the committee focused in areas where sometimes I stray in other places. It has been one of the most satisfying legislative experiences that I have ever had. 
   Other members of the committee, the same way. Senator MOYNIHAN was into this issue before we even discovered it and came onto the committee with great enthusiasm. Senator SMITH of Oregon, who came to the Senate as a businessman, took charge of dealing with business and Y2K's impact on business and has been tremendously helpful. We have had Senator BINGAMAN, who we have asked to focus on the national defense issues. Senator COLLINS, as a representative of the Governmental Affairs Committee, has held hearings in that committee based on what she has come up with out of our committee. Senator KYL did all of the heavy lifting on the committee for last year's bill on disclosure and has been enormously valuable. 
   And then we have, unlike any other committee in the Senate, two ex officio members, TED STEVENS of Alaska and ROBERT C. BYRD of West Virginia; and the fact that the Federal Government received literally billions of dollars in emergency funds in the last supplemental, which, I think, have dealt with the true emergency. I think we are responsible for our being where we are in many of the government agencies. I don't think that would have happened if the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee were not involved directly and particularly in the work of this particular special committee. 
   So, with that tribute to my fellow Senators on this committee and the work that has been done, I will reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President, to allow the vice chairman of the committee and the ranking Democrat, Senator DODD, to make his statement. 
   Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BENNETT. Thank you. 
   In the list of questions I laid out at the beginning of my presentation, we are now at the point where we are asking the two questions: What should we be doing next and what can we expect? 
   The Senator from Connecticut talked about the liability bill. I agree with him absolutely that we cannot take this particular emergency and turn it into a stealth operation to slip through other legislation, even though I would be for it. The Senator from Connecticut would be opposed to it. I would love to do that. But I think that would be an inappropriate thing to try to do. 
   It has just come to my attention a demonstration of why we need some kind of limited liability relief tied to this. I had an interview with an individual who is following Y2K matters, and she said, ``What are you going to do about insurance companies that are canceling policies over Y2K?'' And quite frankly, I was skeptical. I said, ``I don't know of any insurance companies that are canceling policies.'' 
   Well, she sent me one. And here it is; it arrived today. I think that is appropriate since this is the day we are talking about Y2K. Here--in an area that the Senator from Connecticut has pioneered, health care--is an insurance company that has sent out an endorsement on one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight different health care policies that they write. 
   They say:  
   The following exclusion is added to Section III [of these policies]: 
   This Policy does not apply to, and the Company will not pay any DAMAGES or CLAIM EXPENSES ..... arising out of, or in any way involving any actual or alleged failure of any ..... ``equipment'' ..... [relating to]:

   Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Chief Justice, as I have sat through this trial, I have not spent much time on questions of reasonable doubt or where the preponderance of evidence lies. Whatever the importance of those concepts in a typical court, the constitutional implications of what we are considering are much more serious than the issues decided in a normal trial. I will not vote to remove a sitting President on the turning of a legal issue. 
   Accordingly, early in the trial I decided that I would not vote to convict under the First Article of Impeachment. It struck me as overly legalistic. I listened to the lawyers argue about the proper form of the article, and I heard about questions of materiality--not a term I use in everyday conversation--and I decided that while the case was there, it was shaky. In order to be sure I would render impartial justice, I asked myself if I would remove Ronald Reagan in a similar circumstance. When I realized I would not, I decided that I could not vote to remove Bill Clinton. 
   Once I had made that decision, I more or less tuned out further discussions on Article One, from either side, and concentrated on Article Two. 
   Here the issues seemed more disturbing. The Constitution guarantees that the most ordinary of citizens has the right to her day in court, regardless of her hair or her nose or her choice of attorneys. The man she sues, even if he is the most powerful man in the country, does not have the right to lie while testifying under oath in her case, to deny her truthful discovery just because it would embarrass him. He does not have the right to encourage others who are beholden to him, either for their jobs or for favors he has done for them, to do the same, even by interference. He does not have the right to coach and mislead potential witnesses. He does not have the right to use the awesome power of the White House public relations apparatus to spread false and malicious rumors about people--calling them ``stalkers,'' ``trailer park trash'' and ``liars''--just because he thinks they might embarrass him if they tell the truth. 
   It has been said that it was understandable for President Clinton to do all these things because he was just trying to cover up a sexual affair, and, after all, everyone lies about sex. Well, not everyone. We have had other Presidents whose sexual improprieties have been made public at awkward times --Grover Cleveland, while a candidate for President, was exposed as having fathered a child out of wedlock. Asked by his panicked political allies what to do he said, ``Tell the truth, of course,'' and won the election. Bill Clinton should take such notes. 
   What finally convinced me to vote for Article Two was the statement of my good friend, Dale Bumpers. I thought he was magnificent. He told us that the fundamental purpose of the Constitution was to ``keep bullies from running over weak people.'' 
   I was struck by that. I wrote it down. Then I asked myself, ``In this case, who is the bully, and who are the weak people?'' 
   While publicly posing as a helpless victim of a relentless prosecutor, it was President Clinton and the people in his famous ``war room'' who were the bullies, using presidential powers and presidential lies to run over the rights of Paula Jones and, if necessary, Monica Lewinsky. 
   Any President who is willing to lie and smear and stonewall, whether under oath in a courtroom or before a TV camera, speaking confidentially to his aides or privately to his family--any President who is so ruthless, disdainful of the truth and callous of the rights of others that he is willing to do anything to ``just win, then''; any President who readily uses the power of his office for his personal ends regardless of who is hurt--that President is a bully and, as such, a threat to the constitutional liberties of us all. 
   Dale Bumpers said that the Constitution was written to keep bullies from running over weak people. That's called justice. William Jefferson Clinton tried to obstruct that justice. And I decided to vote to remove him from office. 
   So there I was--ready to vote not guilty on Article One, guilty on Article Two. I sat down and wrote a fancy speech outlining these conclusions, showed it to a few friends, notified my staff and sat back to let things play out. 
   As the trial proceeded, however, something was gnawing at me. The perjury charge kept creeping back into my mind. That something, as I confronted it, was my experience with the Clinton political apparatus and its modus operandi. At the heart of everything that apparatus and its operatives do, whatever the situation, is the process of lying. 
   Some of their lies have been whoppers, some trivial. Most have been dismissed as mere ``spin,'' relatively few have been under oath, but the continuing pattern of distorting, avoiding and, when necessary, simply denying the truth goes back to the 1992 campaign. It has carried through the three Senate investigations in which I have participated. On a parochial note, it defined the process of creating a stealth National Monument in my state. It has permeated the entire PR campaign connected with the Lewinsky affair. The New York Times calls it ``habitual mendacity.'' 
   If this were a standard trial, as juror I would not know any of that. I would have to make up my mind solely on the basis of the evidence presented here. Some would say I still should. 
   I believe that the Framers of the Constitution dictated otherwise. They chose the Senate as the trial court of impeachment deliberately, giving us extensive powers as both judge and jury, and they were not naive enough to think that we would check our understanding of the history of the accused President at the door as we took up this burden. They intended for this to be different than a typical trial court. 
   When I realized that, I began to rethink my earlier decision. With such a pattern of ``habitual mendacity'' running through his entire public career, could I really say that Bill Clinton's perjurious testimony before the Grand Jury didn't warrant removal? 
   I made my decision to change my vote to ``guilty'' on Article One during the closing arguments when Charles Ruff, the President's attorney, asked us a question with respect to an alleged high crime or misdemeanor. He asked, ``would it put at risk the liberties of the people?'' 
   As I watched a replay of the President's testimony repeating obvious lies while under oath, I realized that the answer is yes. A President who has demonstrated a capacity to lie about anything, great or small, whether or not under oath, does threaten our liberties. We cannot be sure of anything he says, we cannot trust his word, whatever the issue. We will always be fearful of where that trait of his could take us, and we should be. 
   So now I will vote guilty on both Articles, with a clear conscience that I have done my duty. And I would vote  the same if the President's name were Ronald Wilson Reagan.

   Mr. BENNETT. Your Honor, as an introductory matter, I think this could really lead to confusion, and I think it's important that the record be clear. For example, it says, the last line, ``contact means intentional touching, directly or through clothing,'' I mean just for example, one could have a completely innocent shake of the hand, and I don't want this record to reflect--I think we're here today for Counsel for the Plaintiff to ask the President what he knows about various things, what he did, what he didn't do, but I, I have a real problem with this definition which means all things to all people in this particular context, Your Honor.

   Mr. BENNETT. Well, Mr. Fisher, let me refer you to paragraph two. It says ``contact between any part of the person's body or an object and the genitals or anus of another person.'' 
   What if the President patted me and said I had to lose ten pounds off my bottom? I--you could be arguing that I had sexual relations with him. Your Honor, this is going to lead to confusion. Why don't they ask the President what he did, what he didn't do, and then we can argue in Court later about what it means. 
   Judge WRIGHT. All right, let me make a ruling on this. It appears that this really is not the definition of contact under Rule 413 because Rule 413 deals with nonconsensual contact. This definition would encompass contact that is consensual, and of course the Court has ruled that some consensual contact is relevant in this case, and so let the record reflect that the Court disagrees with counsel that this is not, about it being the definition under Rule 413. It's not. It is more in keeping with, however, the Court's previous rules, but I certainly agree with the President's Counsel that this, the definition number two is too encompassing, it's too broad, and so is definition number three. Definition number one encompasses intent, and so that would be, but numbers two and three is just, are just too broad.

   Mr. BENNETT. Your Honor, I object to this record being filled with these kinds of things. This is going to leak. Why don't they ask--they have got the President of the United States in this room for several hours. Why don't they ask him questions about what happened or didn't happen? 
   Judge WRIGHT. I will permit him to refer to definition number one, which encompasses knowing and intentional sexual contact for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire. I'll permit that. Go ahead. 
   Q. All right, Mr. President, in light of the Court's ruling, you may consider subparts two and three of Deposition Exhibit 1 to be stricken, and so when in my questions I use the term ``sexual relations,'' sir, I'm talking only about part one in the definition of the body. Do you understand that, sir? 
   A. I do. 
   Q. I'm now handing you what has been marked Deposition Exhibit 2. Please take whatever time you need to read Deposition Exhibit 2.

   Mr. BENNETT. Your Honor, again, what I am very worried about, Your Honor, is first of all, this, this, this appears to be a--I mean what I don't want to do is have him being asked questions and then we don't, we're all ships passing in the night. They're thinking of one thing, he's thinking of another. Are we talking criminal assault? I mean this is not what a deposition is for, Your Honor. He can ask the President, what did you do? He can ask him specifically in certain instances what he did, and isn't that what this deposition is for? It's not to sort of lay a trap for him, and I'm going to object, to the President answering and having to remember what's on this whole sheet of paper, and I just don't think it's fair. It's going to lend to confusion. 
   Judge WRIGHT. All right, do you agree with Mr. Bennett?

   Mr. BENNETT. Your honor, I have no objection where the appropriate predicates are made for them to ask the President , did you know X, yes or no, what happened, what did you do, what didn't you do. We are--acknowledge that some embarrassing questions will be asked, but then we will know what we're talking about, but I do not want my client answering questions not understanding exactly what these folks are talking about. 
   Now, Your Honor, I told you that the President has a meeting at four o'clock, and we've already wasted twenty minutes, and Mr. Fisher has yet to ask his first factual question. 
   Judge WRIGHT. Well, I'm prepared to rule, and I will not permit this definition to be understood. Quite frankly there's several reasons. One is that the Court heretofore has not proceeded using these definitions. We have used, we've made numerous rulings or the Court has made numerous rulings in this case without specific reference to these definitions, and so if you want to know the truth, I don't know them very well. I would find it difficult to make rulings, and Mr. Bennett has made clear that he acknowledges that embarrassing questions will be asked, and if this is in fact an effort on, on the part of Plaintiff's Counsel to avoid using sexual terms and avoid going into great detail about what might or might not have occurred, then there's no need to worry about that, you may go into the detail.

   Mr. BENNETT. Your Honor, excuse me, Mr. President, I need some guidance from the Court at this point. I'm going to object to the innuendo. I'm afraid, as I say, that this will leak. I don't question the predicates here. I question the good faith of counsel, the innuendo in the question. Counsel is fully aware that Ms. Jane Doe 6 [Monica Lewinsky] has filed, has an affidavit which they are in possession of saying that there is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape or form, with President Clinton, and yet listening to the innuendo in the questions---- 
   Judge WRIGHT. No, just a minute, let me make my ruling. I do not know whether  counsel is basing this question on any affidavit, but I will direct Mr. Bennett not to comment on other evidence that might be pertinent and could be arguably coaching the witness at this juncture. Now, Mr. Fisher is an officer of this court, and I have to assume that he has a good faith basis for asking the question. If in fact he has no good faith basis for asking this question, he could later be sanctioned. If you would like, I will be happy to review in camera any good faith basis he might have.

In preparation of the witness for this deposition, the witness is fully aware of Ms. Jane Doe 6's (Monica Lewinsky's) affidavit, so I have not told him a single thing he doesn't know, but I think when he asks questions like this where he's sitting on an affidavit from the witness, he should at least have a good faith proffer.
