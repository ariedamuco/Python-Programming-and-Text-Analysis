Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, earlier today, we passed an Omnibus Appropriations bill that expressed important Congressional intent regarding the education of American children. By passing legislation to reduce class size in public schools, we are doing something concrete, common-sense, and effective to improve the quality of education across America. I am very proud of this Congress today. 
But although there has been plenty of attention this last week devoted to the issue of class size reduction through helping local school districts to hire qualified teachers, I feel we are in danger of overlooking the true significance of the policy and funding we have passed here today. 
By making this investment, which we will be increasing over the next several years, we are sending an important message to every community in this nation. The message is `we have been listening. We have heard you. You've been saying that class size reduction is important because it makes a tangible difference in real-world public schools.' 
This new law will not solve every problem in every school in America; that is not the appropriate federal role. Local communities make the decisions that improve local schools. The federal role is to support local decisions. I want people to know that Congress is finally listening; this place is starting to ring with your voice. This class size effort will help jump-start discussions in every local community and every state legislature--where the class size decisions that affect all schools will be made. And, this appropriations bill puts us all on the road to doing something tangible to helping the students in America's schools. 
Some in Congress have made the argument: `who do you trust to make decisions regarding the education of your children, your local educators and school boards, or some faceless bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.?' 
For 5 years, I was a school board member in the Shoreline School District. I saw first-hand how every decision gets made in a school district, including how many teachers get hired, and what the budget will be for supplies, and what changes will be made to the bus schedule. And in those years and all the years since, I have heard local citizens say about the laws that affect their schools that they want their government to learn how to listen to the people it represents. 
I have not heard people say that the government should walk away from its responsibilities, to support the children in public schools across America. I have not heard people advocate that the federal government should ignore its responsibility to prevent unfair treatment, or that it should ignore national priorities. 
I have heard many times, however, parents and other local citizens ask very loudly for government to set goals, to get us on the right path, to do what works, to streamline its efforts, and to invest in common-sense solutions. 
At the top of this list is class size reduction. Class size is common-sense, and it does work. 
The research shows it: 
A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR program, which compared the performance of students in grades K-3 in small and regular-sized classes, found that students in small classes (13 to 17 students) significantly outperformed other students in math and reading, every year, at all grade levels, across all geographic areas. 
A follow-up study of the STAR program in 1995 found that students in small classes in grades K-3 continued to outperform their peers at least through grade 8, with achievement advantages especially large for minority students. 
Other state and local studies have since found that students in smaller classes outperform their peers in reading and math, perform as well or better than students in magnet or voucher schools, and that gains are especially significant among African-American males. 
A 1997 national study by Educational Testing Service found that smaller class size raises average achievement for students in fourth- and eighth-grade math, especially for low-income students in `high-cost' regions. 
Particularly of note in the 1997 ETS study was the finding that in eighth-grade, the achievement effect comes about through the better discipline and learning environment smaller class size produces. As policy-makers try to make decisions that will affect students in the critical years of middle-school, class size makes a difference in terms of both behavior and academic achievement. 
In addition, state organizations representing thousands of local educators know that hiring more high-qualified teachers to reduce class size works: 
Larry Swift, Executive Director Emeritus of the Washington State School Directors' Association says it well:  
As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for all of our students, it becomes increasingly important that all of our resources be used efficiently and effectively. The most valuable resource in today's schools is the people who devote their time and effort to make schools successful--the teachers. Reducing the ratio of students to adults is particularly critical for youngsters with a variety of learning challenges that must be overcome if those students are to meet the new, higher learning standards. 
Kenneth Winkes, with the Washington Association of School Principals says: 
It is increasingly evident that students entering our schools have diverse and unique needs which can only be addressed by principals, teachers, and support personnel who are not overwhelmed by crowded classrooms. Rather, educators must be able to devote attention to each student in smaller, more manageable classes. 
Lee Ann Prielipp, President of the Washington Education Association says: `When educators have too many students in a class, it is hard for them to give each student the individual attention that students need. It is this individual attention that is at the heart of the learning process, and it is crucial in helping our students succeed.' 
And, as I've pointed out before, students themselves have thoughts about the importance of class size reduction: 
Brooke Bodnar, age 16, recently moved from a school with larger classes to Olympia High School, which has smaller classes. She says: `. . . with smaller classes I'm learning so much more. Class is going so much faster.' 
Jared Stueckle, age 16, a junior at Selah High School, believes that education should be a higher priority in funding, and that class size is a good investment. Jared says: `The classes in which the number (of students) is lower I generally do better, but in a crowded class, the teacher does not give us enough individual attention.' 
Meghan Sullivan, age 15, a 10th grader at Tumwater High School, says: `. . . reduction is needed especially at the K-5 grade levels. This is the beginning of their education and this is where they form study habits and learning skills, so it's more important to get some one-on-one contact with teachers.' 
Antonella Novi, age 18, a senior at Anacortes High School, says: 
`Smaller class sizes enrich the learning experience for the student and the teaching experience for the teacher.' 
Jaime Oberlander, age 16, a junior at Tumwater High School, says: 
`I know that I have learned more in smaller classes. I have a stronger relationship with the teacher. I am less intimidated to participate in class discussions or ask for help when I need it. I also receive more feedback from my teacher . . . my teacher can spend more time critiquing my work and helping me to learn.' 
The American people have said over and over how important class size reduction is to them. When students start school in the fall, parents usually ask two questions: `Who is my child's teacher?' and `How many students will be in my child's class?' This is because, next to parents and family, the teacher is one of the most important adults in every child's life. We want that teacher to be the best-trained, most-qualified person available. And, we want the number of students in class to be manageable, so each student has access to the teacher, and the teacher is not reduced to doing `crowd control.' 
Qualified teachers in small classes can provide students with more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction and less on discipline and other tasks, cover more material more effectively, and work more closely with parents. Today Congress has done something significant and important--taken the first step to helping local communities increase the 
number and quality of the teachers in America's schools. 
I want to thank all those who helped this happen, from the President and his staff, to Secretary Riley and those who work so diligently, to Senator Daschle and our Democratic Leadership in both the Senate and the House. I want to particularly thank Senator Harkin, who worked with me on a strategy to turn the early defeat of the Administration's larger class size proposal into a one-year version, funded through an existing program--a clear victory for every student in America. I also want to especially thank Senator Ted Kennedy for his stalwart efforts to negotiate the final elements of this bill in consultation with me. His work is always excellent, here particularly so. 
And I'd like to single out the people who joined me as co-sponsors of my bill, the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Improvement Act of 1998: Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Daschle, Moseley-Braun, Boxer, Levin, Robb, Lieberman, Reed, Lautenberg, Landrieu, Torricelli, Bryan, Kerry, Akaka, Glenn, Bingaman, and Mikulski. And I would like to thank Senator Russ Feingold who has given so much time and attention to the issue of class size reduction, and recognizing local efforts. 
Finally, I would like to thank a few key staff people who worked on this issue all year: Marsha Simon, Ellen Murray, and Bettilou Taylor from the Appropriations Committee staff and Bev Schroeder with Senator Harkin, Joan Huffer with Senator Daschle, and Danica Petroshius with Senator Kennedy and Amy Abraham with the Budget Committee. I would also like to thank Greg Williamson, Micki Aronson, April Graff, Kennie Endelman and Minerva Lopez with my staff. 
As with all things, the class size legislation would not have passed without the efforts of many, many people all working with determination, willing to make compromises on details and get to the important goals. 
On other educational issues, we have also made progress this year. The funding levels for adult and family literacy programs have seen modest improvement--something I've worked hard for, and something that needs more improvement. And children's literacy has seen an important first step, in passage and funding for the Reading Excellence Act. Reading efforts around the country and in my state should look on this national attention to reading as the first step to further support. 
On education technology, we have made such important investments. Not only did we fund $75 million for teacher technology training for pre-service teachers, but this year we passed the Higher Education Act, which includes my Teacher Technology Training bill, and we have provided another $75 million to fund the partnerships that will make the new law possible in every local community. 
On funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, we have included the $500 million I asked for in my budget amendment earlier this year, and we did not have to jeopardize other educational priorities to do it. In addition, by including special education teachers in the class size proposal, we have taken important steps to helping local communities deal with the important educational needs of all students. 
There were also mis-steps in this bill--cuts to our schools that did not need to happen, negative language that will stir up unnecessary ill-feelings, or funding shifts, such as the one under the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program, that should have been done in a way more reflective of local expertise. But all in all this is a good bill for education, and puts us on the right path. 
The Americans I talk to about education funding usually cannot believe that education is really a priority in Congress. After all, only 1.8 percent of overall education spending goes to education. This is the next great challenge. People want Congress to live up to its responsibilities, to look at its priorities, and to listen to people in communities across this great nation. This year, we made some important investments. Next year, we reauthorize the major K-12 education laws. We must look to all of these processes with respect for local knowledge, with bipartisanship, and with a steadfast determination to making education better for all students.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Omnibus Appropriations measure before us contains an important provision regarding foreign ownership and control of United States fishing vessels as well as a resolution of disputes regarding the North Pacific pollock fishery. More than one year ago, Senator Stevens introduced S. 1221, the American Fisheries Act. A major purpose of this legislation, and a goal I strongly support, was to further increase the level of ownership of U.S. fishing vessels. The Americanization of the U.S. fishing industry began in 1976 with the passage of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act which established a 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and prioritized access to fishery resources within the EEZ to American citizens. This legislation is an historic milestone in international marine policy and set a precedent that all coastal nations have followed. It was an important step in securing American control of the vast fishery resources off our coastlines. 
Eleven years later, another step was taken to further Americanize U.S. fisheries. The 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act required U.S. citizens to own and control at least 51% of any U.S.-flag fishing vessels. This Act also included grandfather provisions that, because of drafting errors, allowed any current U.S. flag fishing vessels that did not meet the new standard to be exempt from the new ownership standard and allowed vessels under contract to be rebuilt into fishing vessels in foreign shipyards to retain their U.S. fishing privileges. The two grandfather provisions allowed a far greater degree of foreign owned and controlled fishing vessels to remain is U.S. fisheries than had been intended. Although the United States Coast Guard correctly interpreted these grandfather provisions in a legal sense, there has been ongoing controversy regarding Congressional intent with these grandfather provisions and their application by the Coast Guard. 
Eleven years later, the American Fisheries Act will finally resolve this issue. It requires a real, effective, and enforceable U.S. ownership threshold for U.S. flag fishing vessels. Under this Act, U.S. citizens must own and control 75 percent of the ownership interest in any U.S. flag fishing vessel. I strongly support these provisions as an important step in our ongoing efforts to Americanize the fisheries of the United States EEZ. It is time to more fully ensure that the vast fishery resources of the United States are harvested by Americans. These provisions will go a long way to making that the case. 
In addition to the further Americanization of U.S. fisheries, the Title included in the Omnibus Appropriations measure also resolves the long-standing allocation battles surrounding the North Pacific pollock fishery. When S.1221 was introduced by Senator Stevens in September 1997, one of the goals in addition to Americanizing the U.S. fishing fleet was to phase out a number of Seattle-based catcher processors that had used the grandfather provisions of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act to enter the pollock fishery. Senator Slade Gorton and I strongly opposed the original legislation because of the devastating impact this phase out would have had on Washington state jobs andthe Puget Sound economy. However, there were a number of Washington state constituencies who strongly supported the legislation and the phase out of these catcher processors. 
In the interest of resolving this issue, Senator Gorton convened a meeting in August 1998 of all the major participants in the North Pacific pollock fishery to explore the possibility of reaching a settlement of the dispute. My good colleague from Washington state established a number of principles which all the parties agreed to and guided the discussion of potential solutions. Those discussions led to the conclusion that 4 key issues needed to be addressed: Americanization, decapital-ization, rationalization, and reallocation. This meeting led to a series of intense negotiations among the major North Pacific pollock fishery participants, led by Senator Stevens office, that provided the framework for the legislation before us. 
While my colleagues from Alaska and Washington have provided a much more detailed outline of the provisions of the American Fisheries Act, I would like to summarize some of the key aspects. 
This bill includes a substantial reallocation of the North Pacific fishery resource, one of the most valuable fishery resources in the world. The 1.2 million metric ton fishery is worth approximately $250 million annually. For the last 6 years, there has been tremendous allocation disputes regarding this resource before the North Pacific Fishery Management Council. Prior to 1992, the offshore component of the fishery harvested approximately 85% of the resource. In 1992, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council reduced this harvest level by allocating 35% of the resource to the onshore component of the fishery, that is, catcher boats delivering to onshore processing plants. Recently, the Council recommended to the Secretary of Commerce increasing this percentage to 39%. This bill provides 50% of the resource to the onshore sector, 10% to the mothership sector, and 40% to the offshore sector, permanently resolving the long-standing allocation battles over this valuable resource. With each percentage point of the total allowable catch valued at approximately $5 million, this shift in harvest opportunity represents anywhere from a $55 million to $75 million reallocation. 
To offset this massive move of fish, the legislation includes a substantial reduction in the excess fishing capacity in the offshore sector. Overcapitalization has been an ongoing problem in all North Pacific fisheries and is the source of the allocation battles that ensue over these fisheries. This act will permanently remove nine pollock factory trawlers from the pollock fishery, in fact, from the U.S. EEZ entirely. Eight of these vessels will be scrapped, preventing them from being used in any fishery in the world. In exchange for retiring these vessels and transferring the pollock catch history associated with them to the onshore sector, the owners of these vessels will be paid $90 million. An additional $5 million will be paid to the remaining participants in the offshore sector of the fishery for the additional reduction in the offshore allocation. $20 million will be provided by the federal government as it bears responsibility for the failure of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act to effectively keep foreign fishing vessels out of the U.S. EEZ. The remaining $75 million will be paid by the onshore sector through a federally-guaranteed loan. 
Replacement of the capacity represented by these removed vessels is prevented by statutorily establishing either through explicit listing of the vessels or specific criteria for participation, the factory trawlers, motherships, catcher boats, and onshore processors that can continue to participate in the North Pacific pollock fishery. This listing of the eligible fishery participants is essential to preventing recapitalization of the fishery and ensuring that steps toward rationalizing the fishery can proceed. It has not been done without controversy, however. There has been a great deal of concern among the fishing industry in Washington state and Alaska about the exclusive listing of onshore processors. Many fishery participants have made a distinction between addressing overcapitalization on the water and on the land. Many have argued that the exclusive listing of onshore processors will deny fishermen competitive markets for their fish. Others are concerned that it locks in substantial foreign investment in the processing sector of the fishery while at the same time the bill seeks to further Americanize the harvesting of fish in the U.S. EEZ. I share these concerns. However, the need to rationalize this fishery necessitates this action. In the absence of this provision, the ability to proceed with the formation of fishery cooperatives as a means to end the race for fish could not be successful. In the end, I feel the potential benefits such rationalization could provide for both the resource and the industry dependent upon it justify this action. Nonetheless, I think it imperative that both the Council and the Congress closely monitor the impacts of this provision to ensure it achieves our goal of improving the situation for fishermen. If not, additional measures may need to be taken. 
This bill relies in great measure on the ability and willingness of the North Pacific pollock fishery sectors to form fishery cooperatives. Fishery cooperatives, authorized under current law, are a privately negotiated allocation on a company-by-company or vessel-by-vessel basis of a portion of the total allowable catch. Similar to an individual fishing quota program, cooperatives provide fishery participants with the certainty they need to stop the race for fish, and harvest and process the fish on a more flexible schedule with greater attention to bycatch, efficiency, and safety. The existing fishery cooperative in the offshore sector of the Pacific Whiting fishery has shown tremendous benefits in these regards and has helped rationalize the fishery. It is hoped that cooperatives can do the same in the pollock fishery. 
In the interest of ensuring that small, independent fishermen are the true beneficiaries of fishery cooperatives, the bill includes a number of requirements for fishery cooperatives in all three sectors which are designed to provide these small, independent fishermen with sufficient leverage in the negotiations to protect their interests. 
In addition, the bill attempts to ensure adequate protections for other fisheries in the North Pacific and Pacific from any potential adverse impacts resulting from the formation of fishery cooperatives in the pollock fishery. The formation of fishery cooperatives will undoubtedly free up harvesting and processing capacity that can be used in new or expanded ways in other fisheries. Although many of these vessels and processors have legitimate, historic participation in these other fisheries, they should not be empowered by this legislation to gain a competitive advantage in these other fisheries to the detriment of participants who have not benefitted from the resolution of the pollock fishery problems. 
While we have attempted to include at least a minimum level of protections for these other fisheries, it is clear to many of us that unintended consequences are likely. It is therefore imperative that the fishery management councils not perceive the protections provided in this bill as a statement by Congress that these are the only protections needed. In fact, the opposite is true. Although the protections provided for the head and gut groundfish offshore sector from the pollock offshore sector are more highly developed and articulated in the bill, the protections for other fisheries are largely left for the Councils to recommend. Those of us involved intimately in the development of this legislation strongly urge the Councils to monitor the formation of fishery cooperatives closely and ensure that other fisheries are held harmless to the maximum extent possible. 
In particular, the legislation directs the North Pacific Council to address the issue of latent capacity in the Bering Sea crab fishery. I am deeply concerned by the recent failure of the North Pacific Council to address this issue in response to this legislation. The relatively minor level of protection provided in the bill for the Bering Sea crab fishery should in no way be construed by the Council as sufficient to protect the crab fishery from potential adverse impacts of pollock fishery cooperatives nor should it be deemed sufficient to address the issue of overcapitalization of the crab fishery and the need to remove latent capacity. I strongly urge the Council to take measures to further reduce latent capacity in the crab fishery beyond that which the License Limitation Program addressed and to avoid rewarding speculative participation in anticipation of the developing industry-funded capacity reduction program being developed by the crab industry. At the same time, the Council should ensure that true historic participants in the crab fishery who have made legitimate investments to harvest crab are not eliminated. 
The American Fisheries Act title in this Omnibus Appropriations measure is an important next step in our efforts to Americanize U.S. fisheries and ensure their long-term sustainable use. I support this provision and will work with my colleagues to ensure that is effectively and fairly implemented. In closing, I want to thank Senator Stevens, Gorton, and Murkowski for their hard work on this legislation. I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of Trevor McCabe, Jeanne Bumpus, Bill Woolf, Martin Kodis, and my own staff, Justin LeBlanc. Without their dedication and perseverance, we would not have put this legislation together.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a young man who was wrongly, viciously struck down in the prime of his life. Matthew Shepard was an innocent, kind, young man pursuing his education and enjoying the life of a college student. Tragically, he is now a reminder of what happens when we do not stand up to hate and bigotry. 
On Monday night in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, hundreds of people from all walks of life came together to remember Matthew and to call for action to end hate crimes. Many people in Washington were outraged and shared in our Nation's sorrow. I was touched by this response and join with so many others in expressing my own deep sense of hopelessness. I know that this was not just an isolated incident. Hate crimes are a real threat. We cannot be silent any longer. 
A week ago today, I joined many of my colleagues down at the White House in celebration of the signing of the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. I was proud to be there to call attention to the importance of this act. I was proud that the legislation increased opportunities for young students and improved access to quality education for all students. I thought about how important it was for us to be focused on the needs of young Americans and their families striving to achieve a higher education. 
I thought of the many college students and high school students I have met who would benefit from these opportunities. I thought about my own college age children and the opportunities they would have. I knew this was a big accomplishment. 
Today, my thoughts are with another young college student who will never experience the opportunities and improvements we worked so hard to achieve. My thoughts have gone from improving opportunities to how to prevent the terrible heartache that Matthew Shepard's family and friends are now experiencing. 
When I first heard of this horrible crime I immediately felt deep sympathy for Matthew's parents. How frightening it must have been for them to fly half way around the world to be with their child who was almost unrecognizable because of the violent attack he suffered. I can't imagine the pain they must be experiencing. There are simply no words that I could offer in comfort. 
I then felt deep sorrow for the community and the University. To know that those who committed this violent and hateful crime are part of their community must be unbearable. This community will never be the same. 
I now feel sorry for our Nation. What we have lost? A young man with so much potential. What might Matthew Shepard have become? We know that he was interested in political science and very interested in this field of study. Could Matthew have become a U.S. Senator? 
I think now that maybe Matthew can teach us all. We need to use this tragic and despicable crime to attack hate as we attack any other disease that kills. We must treat hate crimes as the deadly threat that they are and do more to prevent them. Hate is nothing more than a cancer that needs to be stopped.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Jeffords to acknowledge and celebrate World Population Awareness Week. 
World population stands today at more than 5.9 billion and increases by more than 80 million per year, with virtually all of this growth in the least developed countries. 
A total of 1.3 billion people--more than the combined population of Europe and North Africa--live in absolute poverty on the equivalent of one United States dollar or less a day; 1.5 billion people--nearly one-quarter of the world's population--lack an adequate supply of clean drinking water or sanitation; more than 840 million people--one-fifth of the entire population of the developing world--are hungry or malnourished. 
Demographic studies and surveys indicate that in the developing world there are at least 120 million women who want more control over their fertility but lack access to family planning. This unmet need for family planning is projected to result in 1.2 billion unintended births. 
The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo determined that a combination of political commitment and appropriate programs designed to provide universal access to voluntary family planning information, education and services can ensure world population stabilization at 8 billion or less rather than 12 billion or more. 
We are pleased to support the week of October 24-31, 1998 as World Population Awareness Week.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I really regret the objection and I rise today to really plead with my colleagues to lift the hold on this really simple, bipartisan resolution that simply encourages our children to stay away from gun violence. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Kempthorne, who has been working with me to try to move this resolution. 
In 2 days it will be October 8, the day this resolution calls upon the President to establish a Day of National Concern for Young People and Gun Violence. In 2 days, the Senate will have missed an opportunity to send a message to our kids that gun violence is the wrong way to solve problems. 
Fortunately, groups like the National Parent-Teacher Association, Mothers Against Violence in America, the American Medical Association, and others are spreading the word without our help. They are encouraging young people all over this country to sign a pledge and promise they--will never take a gun to school; will never use a gun to settle a dispute; and will use their influence to prevent friends from using guns to settle disputes. That is what this resolution is about. 
Mr. President, this is exactly the message the United States Senate should be sending to our children. We want them to make a personal commitment against violence. We want them to help convince their friends to do the same. We want them to join together to fight against youth violence. Just like we should be doing. 
We must pass this resolution. Let me read to you a list of the Senators who have committed themselves to establishing this day of concern and helping steer kids away from violence: Senators Kempthorne, Lautenberg, Smith of Oregon, Kennedy, Baucus, Specter, Robb, Akaka, Sarbanes, Chafee, Lieberman, Faircloth, Jeffords, Gorton, Reid of Nevada, D'Amato, Daschle, Rockefeller, Kerrey of Nebraska, Lugar, Feingold, Bumpers, Abraham, Craig, Collins, Wellstone, Cochran, Grams, Graham of Florida, Durbin, Boxer, Hutchison, Levin, Glenn, Moseley-Braun, Biden, Moynihan, Feinstein, Dodd, Bingaman, Torricelli, Johnson, Breaux, Warner, Frist, Inouye, Landrieu, Burns, Kohl, Kerry of Massachusetts, Wyden, Conrad, Bumpers, Mikulski, McCain, Snowe, Nighthorse Campbell, and Bennett. There are 59 Senators who are cosponsors of this simple resolution to prevent gun violence amongst our youths. 
We all are convinced the best way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual children and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution gives parents, teachers, government leaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a special day to focus on the problems caused by young people and gun violence. October is National Crime Prevention Month--the perfect time to center our attention on the special needs of our kids and gun violence.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, Senator Wellstone and I are introducing the Battered Women's Economic Security Act. This legislation was developed in order to address the numerous economic obstacles facing victims of domestic and family violence as they try to escape this violence. 
I know that Senator Wellstone joins me in applauding Senator Biden's efforts in crafting legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act programs. Senator Biden developed a bipartisan bill to build on the success of VAWA and expand those programs aimed at the immediate needs of victims of domestic violence. 
The legislation we are introducing today takes the next step. As a result of VAWA and the increased federal commitment to addressing the domestic violence crisis, we now have an infrastructure in place that helps the community respond to this violence. VAWA has been a success in helping local law enforcement, and the courts, prosecute those who batter and abuse women. VAWA provides a strong law enforcement component as well as services to provide immediate and emergency assistance to victims. But, the road to recovery is much longer and much harder because of economic barriers. 
As I learned last year in my efforts to maintain a safety net for victims of family violence, often times it is basic economics that trap women and children in violent homes and relationships. Economic barriers threaten the success of VAWA and work to maintain the threat of violence. 
We all know the cost of domestic and family violence. But, there is a much greater cost to the community that is often overlooked. How many police officers have been caught in the cross fire when responding to domestic and family violence calls? How many innocent children grow up in a violent home and bring this violence into the classroom or future relationships? We have made a commitment to ending domestic violence, however, in order to succeed we must tear down the economic barriers. 
We have insurance policies that discriminate against victims of domestic violence. Some insurance companies think that victims of domestic violence are engaging in high risk behavior similar to a race car driver or sky diver. Life, homeowners, auto and health insurance are essential elements of economic security. Eliminating this protection for victims of domestic violence threatens their ability to achieve economic independence. It also discourages women from coming forward and reporting this violence and abuse for fear that their insurance company will use it against them. 
Don't let anyone tell you this does not happen. I can give many examples of insurance discrimination faced by victims of domestic violence. Just ask Kaddas Bolduc from Washington, whose estranged husband burned down her home. Her insurance company refused to honor her homeowner's policy as they decided this was not arson, but a violent response to the break up of a relationship. Her husband had been released from jail shortly before the fire. She was told that she had no claim and no way to rebuild her home. I would have to say that this is a serious economic barrier that must come down. 
I have met with many domestic violence advocates in Washington and have listen to their concerns about finding long term security for victims. I have heard horror stories about the lack of affordable housing or the inability of victims to secure safe housing. Many landlords refuse to rent to a victim for fear that the violence will follow her. Many women do not have a lease or mortgage in their name. They have no real credit history and certainly cannot prove that they were reliable tenants. As a result they have a difficult time finding housing. Shelters are simply temporary solutions and in many communities the need far outweighs the availability of emergency shelter space. 
We need to expand Section 8 opportunities for victims of domestic violence in order to ensure that they can find long term housing. A safe, affordable home is often a goal that many battered women are unable to achieve. Many women end up back in violent homes or relationships as they have no where else to go. In order to end domestic and family violence we must provide greater housing assistance and opportunities to those who have suffered this violence. 
Currently, there are many barriers to work for victims of domestic violence. Safe, 
affordable child care would be the greatest barrier and I believe the bonus provisions included in this bill will provide the incentives to the states to address this problem. We need to expand child care options and benefits for victims of domestic violence, but we cannot do it at the expense of other low income women an families struggling to stay off of welfare. I believe we need to work with the states in addressing the unique needs of victims of domestic violence. 
Unfortunately, the violence can follow women into the work place which jeopardizes their health and safety as well as their job. Many women are unable to take leave to seek relief in the courts. They do not have the luxury of taking time off to file for a restraining order or to testify against their abuser. They cannot take sick leave to seek medical attention or treatment. Many employers simply do not offer or provide the flexibility that these women need. Included in this legislation we are introducing today is the Employment Protection for Battered Women introduced by Senator Wellstone. I believe these provisions will help battered women maintain their jobs without jeopardizing their safety. 
But when the threat of violence becomes so great as to jeopardize the woman and her coworkers she must be able to leave the job immediately. Unfortunately, many states refuse to allow these women the ability to collect unemployment compensation as they rule that she left on her own accord. However, many women are forced to leave a job and should not be penalized because they are being harassed and have been subjected to abuse in the past. Our legislation includes provisions that would allow a victim of domestic violence to collect unemployment compensation when they are forced to leave their job due to the thereat of continued violence. 
I have also heard first hand from advocates who have been working with women in an effort to change their Social Security number in order to flee a violent abuser. It is impossible to secure employment without giving out one's Social Security number. It is impossible to rent an apartment or even establish credit without a Social Security number. Yet giving out this number can make it easier for an abusive husband or boyfriend to track a woman down. The ability to change their Social Security number becomes the difference between economic dependency and economic independence. Yet it is easier to change one's number based on superstition than it is because one is trying to flee a violent relationship. 
The Office of Victims Advocacy at the Washington State AG's office told me that it can take as long as six months to change a Social Security number and that is in a case where there was a clear need to change the victim's identity. But, in most cases it takes more than 12 months and for some it may never happen. The Social Security Administration must work to correct this threat. Included in our legislation is a requirement that the Social Security Administration expedite requests from victims of domestic violence for a change in their Social Security number in order to achieve economic independency faster and safer. 
The legislation is the result of months of drafting and working with domestic violence advocactes to address the many economic barriers facing victims. In working to strengthen the Family Violence Option in welfare reform, I became painfully aware of the barriers that punitive welfare reform provisions had created. But I realized that this was only one of many barriers. 
VAWA took the first step in dedicating federal resources to addressing the domestic violence crisis, but its whole focus is law enforcement and emergency response. We need to go to the next level to truly end violence against women. We need to address these economic needs and problems. I believe our legislation meets this test and will eliminate many of the economic barriers that trap women and children in violent homes and relationships. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Conference Report. I seek clarification from the Chairman on two matters related to flood control measures along the Cowlitz River in Washington state necessary to mitigate impacts from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. That eruption reduced the Cowlitz River channel capacity to one tenth of its pre-eruption level. In 1985, Congress enacted Public Law 99-88 which authorized and directed the Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) to construct, operate, and maintain a sediment retention structure with such design features and associated downstream actions as are necessary. An October 1985 Decision Document identified specific levels of protection for Cowlitz River communities, consistent with risk assessments and NED criteria.

Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding me time. 
Mr. President, as a member of the conference committee, I wish to express my deep appreciation for the committee's work and its leadership in crafting the higher education reauthorization bill that is so vital to our country's future. This bill is a major victory for students and teachers across America. The committee provided the opportunity to hear from countless witnesses from across the Nation who testified on everything from default rates to job hunting, campus crime to child care. 
Mr. President, throughout the committee's effort on this bill, I worked to strengthen our Nation's commitment to providing the strongest training possible for schoolteachers. I am most pleased with the bill's focus on teacher training and, in particular, its emphasis on technology training. 
A year ago, I introduced the Teacher Technology Training Act to add technology to the areas of professional development and teacher training that are included in current law. I thank the chairman and the ranking members of both sides for their cooperation and support in adding these critical pieces to the bill. 
The work of the committee on the teacher education provisions is really very historic and is a drastic overhaul of the previous teacher training section. Teacher quality grants will institute State level reforms to ensure both current and future teachers will possess the skills and academic knowledge to teach children effectively in their assigned areas. As a member of the Labor Appropriations Subcommittee, I will fight to ensure that this section is finally funded at a level that does make a difference in the classroom. 
This teacher quality section particularly highlights training in the effective use of technology in our classrooms. All of us have witnessed the tremendous impact that technology now plays in our daily world. It affects the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and the way our children learn in school. Young people today are in the midst of a technology explosion that has opened up limitless opportunities and possibilities in the classroom. In order for students to tap into this potential and be prepared for the 21st century, they have to learn how to use new technologies. But all too often teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their instruction without being given the training to do so. 
We simply cannot allow students to teach our teachers in the rapidly expanding area of technology. I have toured several teaching schools and found them well supplied with up-to-date equipment. However, teaching students are often not provided adequate instruction in the use of that technology beyond simple communication purposes. It is not enough for a teacher to be able to just e-mail. They must use this education technology to advance their curriculum and to provide their students with resources along the information highway. 
Last year, amazingly, just 10 percent of new teachers reported that they felt prepared to use technology in their classrooms; and only 13 percent of all public schools reported that technology-related training for teachers was mandated by the school, the district or teacher certification agencies; and only 18 States required preservice technology training. 
This act will significantly turn those numbers around and provide our teachers with the training so critical to harnessing new technologies. So, again, I thank the conferees for their leadership on this effort. I also thank my colleague, Senator Wellstone, for his work on the TANF amendment. It is so important for literacy instruction and lifelong learning. I know this issue remained unresolved, and I hope my colleagues will listen to Senator Wellstone and will soon see the direct link between educational opportunities and economic self-sufficiency. 
I believe this first generation of the new millennium will benefit immensely from the efforts put forth over this past year. From increases in financial aid, to campus security improvements, to technology instruction, this legislation will stand as a proud trademark of this Congress. 
I thank the Chair. I yield my time back to my colleague from Minnesota.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Kennedy amendment and as a cosponsor of the minimum wage increase. 
I cannot sit idle as I hear of those struggling to live on today's minimum wage. I thought, like many of you, that the minimum wage earner was my daughter or one of her friends: a teenager flipping burgers or taking food orders to earn some extra cash for new clothes or a movie. 
That is the misperception though. The sad fact is that 71 percent of those workers who benefited from the last increase were adults over the age of 20. This increase will benefit those that need it most--working families at the bottom. A full-time, year-round minimum wage worker in 1997 earned only $10,712, $2,000 less than the $12,803 needed to raise a family of three out of poverty. Some 40 percent of minimum wage workers are the sole income-earners in their families. 
I am immensely troubled with the fact that 58 percent of those struggling with a minimum wage are women. These millions of women, many of them single mothers, would benefit directly from this increase. 
These single moms are trying. Trying to raise two kids on a below-poverty income. And how does Congress reward these single parents? By attacking Medicaid that would have paid for her son's asthma medicine. By cutting her child care support that allows her work. By taking away funding for nutrition programs that pay for her kids to eat at school or day care. By eliminating her Head Start Program that gives her kids a chance at starting school ready to learn. By refusing to add one dollar to her hourly wage--a wage that pays for heat, clothing and food. 
Aren't these the individuals and families we are trying to keep employed and off of federal support? Instead, this Congress has targeted the low-income family through cut after cut and a resistance to move them above the poverty line. 
This amendment does not eliminate jobs, it barely keeps people working, who otherwise would be completely reliant on public support. Today's minimum wage is 18 percent below the 1979 level. Each year we wait means a loss of $2,000 to that single mother. To that low-income family, that would have meant more than seven months of groceries, four months of rent, a full year of health care costs, or nine months of utility bills. 
I did not reach my decision to support the minimum wage easily. I have listened carefully to the concerns of small-business owners from across my state, who have highlighted the implications of this increase. I don't want to see prices for the American consumer rise or jobs eliminated. But I don't think an increase to the minimum wage will end employment in small business, either. 
Now is the time to adjust that inequality and demonstrate a true commitment to our working families. A slight increase in this wage provides those who work hard and play by the rules an increased opportunity and a chance to succeed. If any of my colleagues oppose the minimum wage, I urge them to try living on $10,712 this year and then reconsider their vote.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to address a bill introduced earlier this week called the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998. This bill takes the best ideas and puts them to work providing Americans with the tools they need to make their families safer, their communities healthier, and their schools freer from violence. 
I know all of us would like a simple solution to the crime problems facing this great nation. But all of us know, in our hearts, that there is no easy solution. We must come together, join with our neighbors, our police, our leaders, and our children to tackle the terrifying problems facing us. 
We must be tough on criminals. We need to continue to send the message that if you do the crime, you will be doing time--hard time. No one can accuse the U.S. justice system of coddling criminals. We have among the highest percentage of our population in prison, more than almost any other country in the world. 
In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which I supported, we strengthened penalties for violent, and drug-related crime. We also provided grants to states to build jails and prisons if they required serious violent offenders to serve at least 75 percent of their sentences. We've hired more than 75,000 new police officers to implement to time-tested program of community policing. Our crime bill has worked. 
Now we need more of the same. We need to extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust fund to pay for these important community-policing and grants to state and local government. 
We need to extend the Violence Against Women Act. Preventing domestic violence and providing a safe haven for victims of domestic violence has been a top priority for me. I intend to introduce legislation to ensure victims of domestic violence are not further victimized through insurance, job or social security discrimination. Should this bill be considered by the Senate, I would seek to amend it by adding provisions of my Battered Women Economic Security Act to it. 
Another top priority for me in this bill is reducing crime in our schools. As a parent and former educator, I share America's horror that our children are not safe in their schools. We simply must invest time and resources into solving this fundamental problem. This bill will provide an additional $10 million for the Safe and Drug Free School program and establish partnerships between schools and local law enforcement. Through my Senate Advisory Youth Involvement team, I am learning from students how they believe we can best solve school violence problems. I will be sharing those ideas with my colleagues when we debate this bill. 
In my meetings with law enforcement officers around my state, I learned we have some critical problems in our juvenile justice system. While I believe juvenile justice is fundamentally 
an issue for our state legislatures to address, there is a federal role in several areas. First, we often should treat those 16 and 17-year-olds who commit violent federal offenses as adults. This bill gives prosecutors important discretion to prosecute these offenders as adults. 
In addition to getting tough on our most hardened young criminals, we must replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies. There are many efforts in my state of Washington that bring out the best in kids and communities and they are truly making a dent in the juvenile crime problem. Best SELF in Skagit county; Teamchild in King county; community justice in Spokane county and on the Colville Indian Reservation; Safestreets in Seattle; and TOGETHER! in Thurston county are several examples of communities joining together to make a difference with their youth. It's amazing how far just a few thousand dollars can go in these community-based programs; they need our continued support. 
Mr. President, this bill also targets gangs, illegal drugs, and domestic and international terrorism. It extends a recently-passed bill I strongly supported, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, and provides other safeguards for our law enforcement officers. It reauthorizes the Drug Czar's office, which coordinates the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program that is helping establish a coordinated campaign against drug importation and use while also focusing resources of prevention and treatment of abuse. 
No bill is perfect and I cannot say I agree with every provision included in this 1220-page bill. However, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 continues to move this country in the right direction. Violent crime must continue to drop. With all of us joining together to fight crime and embrace healthy communities and schools, America can again become a safe place to raise and educate all of our children. 
I thank Senator Leahy for his fine leadership on this bill and encourage all Senators to work to pass comprehensive, bi-partisan legislation to prevent crime and strengthen families and communities.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to in support of the President's veto of the so-called Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act and urge my Colleagues to join me in defeating this real threat to women's health. 
Most of what has been said here today in support of this ban is troubling, because some have implied that women make health care decisions in haste without much thought or understanding. Let me assure my Colleagues that women have the ability to make informed health care decisions. We are more than capable of understanding the difference between pre and post viability. We are more than capable of making wise health care decisions in consultation with our physicians and family. We do not need Members of Congress making our health care decisions. I believe that most women would argue that health care decisions are best left to physicians and patients. 
We argue that patients and doctors should make health care decisions. Not insurance bureaucrats. Yet today many of my Colleagues are trying to make a major health care decision for many women in this country. Not just a health decision but for some women a life or death decision. This is why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists oppose this ban. They understand the threat to women. They know first hand the complications that can develop throughout a pregnancy. They have experienced first hand the risk that many women face throughout a pregnancy. They are the one's we should be listening to in this debate. 
That is the issue. Protecting the life and health of the woman. This is not about choice or even about the Constitution. This is about protecting the life and health of women. 
Let me point out to my Colleagues, post viability abortions are prohibited except when necessary to save the life and health of the woman. This is the law of the land and I support it. But the legislation that the Administration wisely vetoed would undermine this standard established by the Supreme Court and includes no exception to save the woman's health and the life exception is so narrow that few could meet the test. There is no exception to protect a women's ability to have additional healthy children. There is no exception to give the doctor the ability to do what is right for his or her patient. This is a dangerous precedent that we cannot allow to go forward. 
I have come to this floor many time to advocate on behalf of women's health. I have had many successes in increasing funding for research and in working to eliminate gender bias in research. I have worked to increase funding for breast cancer research. I have fought to improve and expand mammography coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. I have worked to increase focus on cardiovascular disease, the number one killer of American women. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have always considered women's health one of my top priorities. 
I am here today for the same reason, to continue my fight for the lives and health of women. I urge my Colleagues to talk to women who have had to make this decision to have this procedure. Listen to what their doctors told them and why they made the decision forced upon them. I know that if you could hear what they have endured and the heartache they have faced you would understand why today's vote is a women's health vote and why this ban is such a danger to women. 
Let women and their doctors make these difficult decisions. This ban is a serious threat to women and their families. Please do not jeopardize a women's health and threaten her life based on gruesome diagrams that simply do not tell the real story. 
I would urge all of those who believe that this legislation is necessary to take the time to listen to phyisicans and women who have had this procdure. I can guarantee that this procedure is only done in the final weeks of a pregnancy when it becomes medically necessary to save the women's life or health.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Gorton in introducing legislation to improve access to health insurance for low income children in Washington State. This bill would amend the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to allow our State access to their allotment of federal funds to provide health coverage to an additional 90,000 eligible children. 
This is not an effort to supplant state funds. This does not take funds from other states. It simply allows Washington to access their allotment of SCHIP funds to cover those children who currently lack any health security. Because of their lack of access to health insurance, these children have little or no access to health care and no access to preventive services. 
These are children whose parents work hard but do not have access to health insurance or cannot afford the cost of premiums. These parents work hard and pay taxes, unfortunately they have little discretionary income to provide important health security for their children. 
Last year, this Congress made a commitment to cover the 10 million uninsured children in this country. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included an expansion in children's health insurance benefits as a down payment on meeting the needs of these 10 million vulnerable children. This Congress took the right step in working to achieve the goal of guaranteeing every child in this country a healthy childhood. What we are attempting to do in this legislation that we are introducing today, is to honor this commitment to the children in Washington State. 
In 1994 Washington State stood up for our vulnerable children. We implemented an expansion in our Medicaid program to cover children up to 200% of poverty. We knew at the time that it was a huge undertaking, but we recognized that investing in our children's health was a wise investment. Because of the final language adopted in the Balanced Budget Act, Washington could not access their SCHIP funds to cover newly enrolled children below the 200% of poverty threshold and above the federal Medicaid requirement. 
As a result, Washington State was penalized for being a leader in children's health. We are here today proposing a technical fix that rewards Washington State and allows them to cover an additional 60,000 to 90,000 children. This is not done at the expense of other States, but rather by using Washington's existing allotment. 
I can assure my colleagues that Washington State will honor our commitment to our children. But without access to these funds, enrolling these children will be almost impossible. If we all share the same goal of insuring these 10 million children, we must enact this legislation. The health care needs of low income children in Washington are just as great and just as important as they are for low income children in other states. 
I am hopeful that we can act on this legislation. This technical remedy will go a long way in meeting our shared goal of guaranteeing access to quality, and affordable health care for all children.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague in the House, Representative Jack Metcalf, to introduce the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act. 
Mr. President, I have always believed that the best way to solve problems is to bring people together and find consensus on an issue. The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act is the direct outgrowth of just such an approach. 
The Northwest Straits include the marine waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the San Juan Islands, and the northern portion of Puget Sound. It is a scenic and unique ecosystem critical to a broad array of sensitive fish and wildlife, including orcas, sea birds, salmon, bottom fish, and bald eagles. 
Recognizing the importance of this precious marine ecosystem, the Northwest Straits were proposed for inclusion in the National Marine Sanctuaries program in some capacity as far back as 1979 when the National Marine Sanctuary Program was in its infancy. Although the Northwest Straits lie entirely within state waters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spent the next seventeen years evaluating the inclusion of this special area into the marine sanctuary program. This process involved substantial public participation. In recent years, it became clear there was insufficient local support to move forward with a Northwest Straits Marine Sanctuary designation for the area. 
In response to these local concerns, Rep. Metcalf and I included a provision in the 1996 reauthorization of the Marine Sanctuaries program barring final designation of a Northwest Straits Marine Sanctuary without Congressional approval. Having thus put the marine sanctuary process on hold, in the Spring of 1997 we established a Citizen's Advisory Commission (the Commission) to identify the key marine resources and values of the Northwest Straits, as well as the threats to them, and recommend appropriate protective measures and a means of coordinating related federal, state, and local actions. The Commission is broadly representative of local interests including County and Port Commissioners, environmental and conservation groups, shipping interests, academics, and Indian Tribes. 
The Commission met diligently for eighteen months to fulfill their mission. In addition to the Commission members, a representative of Governor Gary Locke participated in meetings and federal, state, and local agencies provided information and technical assistance. All Commission meetings have been open to the public and interested parties. The Commission has researched and reviewed the issues surrounding the Northwest Straits exhaustively and presented their formal recommendation to Representative Metcalf and myself on August 20. 
The Commission has concluded that the very fabric of the Northwest Straits is unraveling, manifesting problems and trends that cross geographic and jurisdictional lines. While the ecosystem is complicated, the trends are simple: bottom fish, sea birds, invertebrates, salmon, and even some marine mammals have declined precipitously since 1980. This depletion of marine resources has hurt economies and communities around the Northwest Straits and further degradation portends far more serious impacts in the future. Existing management schemes, while sufficient in terms of legal authority, have failed to achieve the coordination and focus to change these trends. 
While the Commission has not reached a consensus to endorse or reject any future alternative management scheme, the Commission recommends a set of steps that would not displace current management responsibilities but seek to compliment them by supplying key missing ingredients for success: sound science and broad support for solutions. These steps include the establishment of a network of local, county-based Marine Resources Committees (MRCs) committed to making all possible progress at the local level to protect and conserve the resources of the Northwest Straits using existing state and local authorities, and based on sound scientific information and the overall needs of the Northwest Straits ecosystem. The MRCs will coordinate activities through a Northwest Straits Commission consisting of representatives of the MRCs, Indian Tribes, the scientific community, and state agencies. The Commission will provide technical assistance, integrate science, develop an ecosystem-level coordination, and coordinate funding. 
In addition, the Commission will assess the performance of the MRCs against a series of benchmarks. These Benchmarks of Performance shall include the assessment and establishment of a scientifically-based regional system of Marine Protected Areas, the assessment and establishment of a scientifically-based regional system to protect nearshore habitat, a net gain in open shellfish harvest areas, and discernable increases in bottom fish and other key marine indicators. Should these benchmarks fail to be met, further consideration of alternative approaches, including a marine sanctuary designation may be resumed. 
In addition, this bill calls for a review of the effort after 5 years by the National Research Council, with particular emphasis on the achievement of the Benchmarks of Performance. With the authorization for this `Local Marine Conservation Initiative' expiring in 6 years, this NRC report will help us assess the accomplishments of this effort to determine whether it should be continued. 
Mr. President, the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act represents the right way to address environmental challenges. By pulling all of the interested parties together to analyze and research not only the issue, but each other's perspectives, partnerships can be forged that will provide long-term benefits. This pragmatic and achievable proposal will truly improve resource protection in the Northwest Straits. It is an innovative, exciting way to address the marine conservation challenges before us. I am excited about this approach and the way it empowers local communities and local citizens to take the initiative to protect their home waters. In many ways, this approach is a test or experiment. The local leaders have the next several years to demonstrate that a coordinated, informed, and empowered local decision-making process can provide true protection for the Northwest Straits. I believe they can meet this challenge. I look forward to Congress' timely consideration of this legislation.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is the sixth year I have been a Member of the U.S. Senate. And this is the sixth year I can recall debating campaign finance reform. I have voted to pass campaign reform legislation in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, and now 1998. We actually passed a good bill in the Senate in 1993. Each time it has been killed off by filibuster. 
Each time I thought, this is it. This is our chance to make some changes that the people of this country will notice and respect. This is our chance to restore a measure of faith in American democracy. While I've had my share of disappointments, today we are here again with a rare and valuable opportunity to actually get a bill signed into law. 
Mr. President, it is critically important that we pass campaign reform legislation. The health of our democracy is not good. Yes, the economy is strong, crime is down, and people are generally feeling good about their lives. But there is an undercurrent that I find deeply troubling, and it's been building for the past two decades. 
People simply do not like government. They do not trust government, and they do not feel like they are part of the process. They are losing faith and I think it would be terrible if we did not do something to re-invigorate peoples' interest in American democracy. 
If any of my colleagues doubt this, just look at voter turnout rates and voter registration rates. People just are not participating any more, and it gets worse each year. 
What exactly is the problem? Money, plain and simple. Too much money, having too much influence over our democratic process. 
The campaign system is so clogged with money, there is hardly room left for the average voter. Political campaigning has become an industry in this country. In the last election, over a billion dollars were spent on federal elections alone. To what end? 
That money--much of it undisclosed, from dubious sources--flowed into the political arena and dictated the terms of our elections to the people. Like water, it flowed downhill into campaigns all across the country. Some of it came out in the form of national party ads attacking candidates in the abstract; some came out in the form of issue-ads by interest groups trying to influence the outcomes. Some of it came out in the candidates' own TV ads. 
It reaches the point where you almost cannot hear the voices of the candidates or the people anymore, only the voices of the dueling special interests. We do not know who pays for these ads, where they get their money, or what they stand to gain if their candidate wins. Yet they have found ways to have a huge influence over the election process. 
Opponents of reform argue against the McCain-Feingold bill on free speech grounds. They argue politicians and political parties should be able to take money in any amount from anyone in order to make the case for their re-election. They believe that having more money entitles one to a greater influence over our campaigns and elections. I find this argument shocking, Mr. President. I find it profoundly un-democratic, and un-American. 
The last time we debated reform, I told a story of a woman who sent my campaign a small contribution of fifteen dollars. With her check she enclosed a note that said, `please make sure my voice means as much as those who give thousands.' With all due respect, Mr. President, this woman is typical of the people who deserve our best representation. Sadly, under the current campaign system, they rarely do. 
I have tried to live by my word on this issue. My first Senate campaign was a shoe-string affair. I was out spent nearly three-to-one by a congressional incumbent. But because I had a strong, grassroots, people-based effort, I was able to win. 
Since then, I have worked hard to keep to that standard. I have over 35,000 individual donors. The average contribution to my campaign is 69 dollars. Nearly 75 percent of my contributions come from within Washington state. I firmly believe that's the way campaigns should be run: by the people. 
We need more disclosure, not less. We need more restrictions on special interest money, not fewer. We need less money in the system, not more. We need to amplify the voices of regular people, instead of allowing them to be shouted down by special interests. 
Mr. President, the opponents of reform miss the point. In America, money does not equal speech. More money does not entitle one to more speech. The Haves are not entitled to a greater voice in politics than the Have-nots. In America, everyone has an equal say in our government. That is why our Declaration of Independence starts with, `We, the people.' 
When this Congress started, I thought this might really be our chance to pass a bill. The public was paying more attention. The excesses of the last campaign season, brought to light through the good work of the Government Affairs Committee, made campaign reform a front-burner issue in every kitchen in America. More than one million signatures were delivered to the Capitol from people all over America who joined a nationwide call for reform. 
A bipartisan group of Senators committed to reform worked overtime to craft a reasonable reform measure that makes sense for America. I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to Senators McCain and Feingold for their work. They generated public support, made their case to the media, and pushed for the last few votes necessary to pass a bill. Well, the time has come to see if this is our chance to do the right thing. 
Our like-minded colleagues in the other body did find the votes, and they did pass a good strong bill. The Senate has more than enough votes to pass the same bill on an up-or-down vote. All we need are eight more votes from the majority party to do the right thing for America. Mr. President, who will it be? Who will be the heroes on this vote? And who will let down the millions of American citizens who have grown sick, tired, and alienated from our democratic system? 
Mr. President, I believe we have made this debate way too complicated. After all the maneuvering, the cloture petitions, the technicalities, the procedural votes, this issue boils down to one basic question: are senators willing to make some modest reforms to reduce the influence of big money in politics and encourage greater voter participation? Or are they more interested in protecting the current system, and the ability of parties and politicians to turn financial advantage into political advantage? 
Are you for reform, or against it? Are you with the people, or against them on the need for a more healthy democracy? The votes we are taking today will show the answers to these questions.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in calling attention to the celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month. 
The Hispanic community in my home state of Washington is the youngest and fastest growing of any ethnic minority group, yet its history is a long one. indeed, Washington was a part of Mexico until 1819. The many Spanish place names that dot the landscape are only part of the legacy of the early Hispanic explorers and settlers. Early Hispanic pioneers helped lay the economic infrastructure of the region, bringing commodities such as wheat and apples and livestock. 
Today Hispanic Americans continue to play a pivotal role in our state's economy. The contributions of Mexican immigrants has been vital in the growth and continued success of our state's agricultural industry. Hispanic-owned businesses range from the mom-and-pop small business to large corporate concerns. Hispanic citizens, taking advantage of their many ties to Mexico and other Latin American nations, have helped to expand trade, our state's economic lifeblood. 
The contributions of Hispanic Americans are not limited to economic ones. Hispanic Americans have risen to positions of leadership throughout the state. They occupy elected offices at all levels of government, including our state legislature and judiciary. Hispanic community activists have led the fight for social equality. The Hispanic community has also enhanced our state's cultural life. Spanish language newspaper and radio, Latin American cuisine and Hispanic customs and ceremonies are an integral part of our state's landscape. 
The Hispanic community has mobilized to meet the challenges facing it. Community-based organizations throughout the state are working to create educational and economic opportunities and meet the need for housing, health and social services. Their efforts benefit not only the Hispanic community but the state as a whole. 
Washington State's Hispanic community is a dynamic and vibrant one. I salute their many accomplishments and contributions. I encourage my colleagues to join me in celebrating the diversity that makes our country so rich by commemorating National Hispanic Heritage Month.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I stand before the Senate today to fight for the men of our country. I am referring to the cancer that has been most frequently diagnosed, in the last decade, in American men--prostate cancer. This cancer kills 40,000 American men every year and I am shocked we are even hesitating to appropriate the necessary funding to enable the Department of Defense to win this battle and find a cure. 
I realize that I often find myself in this same place, fighting for women's health. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have consistently fought to provide the necessary funding for breast cancer research. Just this year, I offered an amendment to the DoD authorization bill that appropriated $175 million for the Breast Cancer Research Program. However, this is a critical time to invest in medical research, all medical research, including prostate cancer. 
Mr. President, we need to fight for the lives of our husbands, brothers, sons, fathers, and grandfathers of America, as well as their families. Death from cancer is tragic yet even more so knowing that we are on the verge of finding a cure. I have been very pleased with the results of breast cancer research and I know that if we gave the DoD adequate funding, it would produce equally impressive results saving thousands of men who would have otherwise not survived this ravaging disease. I believe we have the science and technology to put an end to unnecessary prostate cancer fatalities. 
I am fully confident that our medical community can step up and find a cure for prostate cancer. However, it is the duty of my colleagues and I to provide medical researchers the resources they need to do so. Now is the time to have faith in our scientific community and stand behind the DoD. President Clinton got the ball rolling when he funded the first cycle of prostate cancer research grants. However, this is not enough. If the DoD is to maintain its program at its current level, it requires an appropriation in FY99 of $80 million. There is no question in my mind what we need to do. 
It is a stark reality that one in every six American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Most victims of this disease are over the age of 65. Upon entering the Senate, I requested to be put on the Veterans Committee to ensure the veterans of Washington state were getting the recognition and benefits to which they are entitled. Many of the men suffering from prostate cancer are veterans. They fought for our country and our freedom. It is time we returned the favor and find the cure to a disease that threatens them all. 
Now is the time to tackle prostate cancer with equal vigor as breast cancer. This is not about decreasing statistics, but is about preventing American families from having to deal with this fatal disease. We must act now. To postpone this essential decision is unacceptable. We must have faith in our medical community and allow them to find the cure.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my chairman, Senator Burns, in bringing to the Senate our conference report on the 1999 military construction appropriation bill. 
Favorable action in the Senate today will send this conference report to the President, making it the first of the regular 1999 appropriations bills to be passed by Congress. This is a noteworthy accomplishment, and I hope it will set the stage for swift action on the remaining appropriations bills. 
We had to make some very tough choices on this bill. Our conference agreement totals $8.4 billion. This is $760 million less than what was appropriated last year. Given the tight budget confines in which we were operating, there were many worthy projects that we could not fund. Not one Senator or one State was exempt from this belt-tightening--not Senator Burns, not me, and not our leadership. Nevertheless, we held ourselves to a high standard of fairness and equity, and our conference report reflects that effort. This report satisfies to the best of our ability the national and international priorities of our military services as well as the regional priorities that our colleagues conveyed to us. Most important, it provides funding for scores of needed projects throughout the United States and overseas that will support America's military personnel, both active and reserve, as they carry out their mission to defend and protect our Nation. 
The State of our Nation's military readiness continues to be a pressing concern. Although we often equate readiness with equipment or troop strength, it is important to remember that basic military construction--troop barracks, family housing, vehicle maintenance centers, and the like--is at the core of military readiness. This bill is the vehicle through which we provide the basic, essential infrastructure necessary to support our troops and advance military readiness. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support this conference report and speed it to the President for his signature. This is the product of a smooth, fair, and bipartisan process. I commend Chairman Burns for his swift and skillful handling of this bill. I commend his staff, Sid Ashworth, and my staff, Ben McMakin, Christina Evans, and Emelie East, for their diligence and thoroughness in preparing this bill for our consideration. It is a good bill, and I hope that all of my colleagues will be able to join me in supporting its passage.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I submit a resolution that passed the Senate last year unanimously. My resolution, which I am introducing today with Senator Kempthorne and more than 50 original cosponsors, establishes October 8 as the Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence. 
Tragically, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after the events of last Friday. While, thankfully, no children were directly involved in the slayings of Officer Jacob Chestnut and Special Agent John Gibson, certainly the officers' children and young people across the nation were hurt and horrified by the violence that occurred in our nation's Capitol. 
I am once again submitting this resolution because I am convinced the best way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual children and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution gives parents, teachers, government leaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a special day to focus on the problems today of young people and gun violence. October is National Crime Prevention Month--the perfect time to center our attention of the special needs of our kids and gun violence.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the DeWine amendment which would prohibit female federal employees from accessing affordable, safe and legal abortion related services as part of their health insurance benefits. 
I am always tempted to say, `here we go again.' Another assault on women's health and another barrier for women to safe, affordable reproductive health services. For some of my colleagues, the 1973 landmark Roe versus Wade decision was not clear enough or they continue to attempt to restrict a women's right guarantee in this decision. 
Instead of standing up and arguing that a woman should not have choices or that women should not be allowed to access safe, affordable reproductive health services, some of my colleagues hide behind the issue of federal funding. 
Health benefits have been, and always will be for the benefit of the federal employee. It is a form of compensation. Every worker knows that health insurance is part of their compensation package, not a gift, not a loan, but something that they have earned. Health benefits are part of one's salary. This is no different for a federal employee or an employee of Boeing. 
We would never see an amendment on the floor of the Senate dictating to federal employees how they spend their salary. As long as the employee spends this compensation on a legal commodity, we cannot restrict his or her decisions. Simply because they are employed by the American taxpayer does not mean that we can dictate how they spend their salary. 
 However, some of my colleagues are proposing to do just that. We are telling female federal employees how they can or cannot spend their health insurance benefits. In addition to denying federal employees the basic constitutional rights afforded every other woman, we are proposing to dictate how they spend their compensation. 
Not only are health benefits considered employee compensation earned by the employee, federal employees are also responsible for up to 40 percent of the cost of the premiums as well as any deductibles or copays. So in fact we are telling female federal employees how to spend their take home pay as well. 
If a federal employee uses his or her own salary to purchase a firearm is this federal funding of handguns? I would argue no. Even though there are federal taxpayers who oppose handguns, we do not restrict the right of federal employees to use their federal salary to purchase one. But, telling female federal employees how they can spend their insurance benefits is just as offensive. Only in this case it is probably more detrimental as it denies female federal employees access to safe, affordable reproductive health service. 
One could argue that female federal employees should pay out of pocket for certain reproductive health services and not depend on her health benefits to cover or provide this protection. I would like to point out that federal employees by and large are not well paid CEOs. They live pay check to pay check and many are single mothers. Covering a $600 or $1,000 health care bill is just not possible. Economic barriers are just as solid as legal or social barriers. Denying health insurance coverage for a full range of reproductive health services, is denying access to these services for many female federal employees. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose efforts to make second class citizens of female federal employees. They deserve our support and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Instead of attacking a woman's right to make her own personal health decisions let's work to prevent unintentional pregnancies. I urge my colleagues to support federal family planning programs and contraceptive equity. The Supreme Court has already said that abortion with some restrictions is a legal right afforded all Americans. Let's not force federal employees to pay the price of political football, but rather let's do more to improve access to safe, affordable family planning benefits.

Ms. MURRAY. Madam. President, I want to thank the sponsor of this important amendment for all his work and effort on behalf of women's health. As a Senator who has long championed women's health issues and fought to protect women's health, I commend him for his efforts. I am pleased to join with him today in support of women's health equity. 
There has been a great deal of debate lately regarding contraceptive equity. Let me first start by explaining what this amendment does not do. It does not mandate benefits. Let me repeat that, this is not a mandate. If a plan does not have a prescription drug benefit then they do not have to add contraceptives. If a plan has a copy of deductible for prescription benefits, then contraceptives would also have the same copy or deductible. If a plan requires payments or deductibles for surgical services, then family planning benefits would also have the same copayments and deductibles. This is not a mandate. It simply says that plans cannot treat contraceptives any differently than medication to treat high blood pressure or to treat diabetes. 
This amendment does not increase federal spending. CBO has scored this amendment as having a minimal effect on spending. The cost is such that CBO cannot even estimate as it falls below their threshold for calculating or determining budgetary impact. I would argue that in fact it will have a positive impact on spending. Currently, 50 percent of all pregnancies in this country are unintentional. Increasing access to safe, affordable family planning can only reduce this number. The average cost annually of oral contraceptives is estimated at $400 to $500. The cost of an uncomplicated delivery is close to $4,000, this excludes any prenatal or postnatal care. It does not take a budgetary expert to conclude that there will actually be savings from this amendment. 
This amendment is also not about abortion. Let me make this very clear. This is not an abortion debate. No part of this amendment would require federal funding of abortions. It simply goes to those contraceptives that are currently approved by the FDA to prevent unintentional pregnancies. RU486 is not currently available in the United States. No plan would be required to cover RU486. If you ask any woman if there is a difference between abortion and contraceptives I can assure you that the answer would be yes. 
Now let me tell you all what this amendment does. This amendment goes to the heart of women's health. Reproductive health and effective family planning are women's health issues. It is hard to go a week without hearing one of my colleagues talk about the importance of women's health. There are probably well over 500 pieces of legislation pending that impact women's health. Every member strives to have a solid record on women's health issues. Every member claims to be a champion of women's health. Yet denying access to safe, affordable contraceptives for federal employees poses a serious threat to women's health. On average, without effective, safe family planning, most women could expect to endure 12 to 13 pregnancies in her life time. While most women have safe and healthy pregnancies, for some it still can be life threatening. And for most women 12 or 13 pregnancies does pose a serious health threat. 
In order to protect women's health and reduce infant mortality it is critical to plan for pregnancy. To place economic barriers for women to receive safe family planning services is to place a significant health burden upon us. 
Many women may not even be aware, but women can expect to pay up to 68 percent more in out of pocket health care costs than men. Ask any woman if she is willing to pay 68 percent more for housing, or food or transportation and I can assure you the answer would be a resounding no. But, for health care this is actually what women face. I stand today to say we must reverse this trend. We already know that women can expect to earn 71 cents for every dollar earned by a man. Now we want to say that they should pay 68 percent more for health care or for any consumer product. 
This is a basic question of equity and fairness. This is even more evident in the federal work force. By and large the federal work force is younger and paid less than the private sector. Effective family planning is even more essential in a younger work force. Many federal employees who live pay check to pay check. Yet, female federal employees have no guarantee that their insurance will not discriminate against them. If there is a health care benefit program that should offer a wide range of affordable reproductive health benefits, I would argue it must be the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. 
There are some of my colleagues who will argue it should be up to the plan or even some who will argue that Members of Congress should decide what methods of family planning are covered. It is these very Members of Congress who also argue that only the physician and patient should be making health care decisions. Not health plans or politicians. I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about who they want making life and death health care decisions. I would hope that my colleagues would concur that only physicians and the patient should be making these decisions. This is why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses this amendment. They know how dangerous it is to make life or death decisions based solely on economics or other arbitrary criteria. 
Economic barriers and discriminatory insurance practices do threaten women's health. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality determined that `infant mortality could be reduced by 10 percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used contraceptives.' With one action we could be reducing our tragic infant mortality rate in this country. The Institutes of Medicine's Committee on Unintended Pregnancy recommended that `financial barriers to contraception be reduced by increasing the proportion of all health insurance policies that cover contraceptive services and supplies.' As the largest purchaser of private health insurance in this country, the Federal Government should set the example for the private market. We should listen to the evidence of the medical community and research scientists and tear down economic barriers within the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. 
I urge my colleagues to let women and their doctors decide, not politicians and certainly not economics. Having access to the most appropriate family planning method without economic sanctions is a women's health issue. Each woman must have the ability to make this decision based on the recommendations of her doctor. To most women, this is a major women's health vote. This is a question of equity and fairness but more importantly it is an issue of access to safe, affordable reproductive health care services. 
How would any Member of this body feel if we found out that our insurance policies would only provide access to one form of high blood pressure medication, regardless of the side effects? How would we react if a plan operating in the FEHBP said that they would charge a higher copayment for prescription drugs to treat heart ailments? How we would respond to these discriminatory practices that threaten quality, affordable health care for FEHBP participants? I can tell you how this member would respond. I would be on the floor offering amendments to end discriminatory insurance practices that result in nothing more than economic sanctions that diminished access to safe health care services. 
We owe our federal employees more and we should be a leader on women's health. I urge my colleagues to vote for women's health instead of just talking about it.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to state my strong support for the Senate version of H.R. 1151. This legislation is important, bipartisan and should be adopted unanimously by my Senate colleagues. I commend the members of the Banking Committee, where I served for four years, for crafting this legislation and moving it to the floor for full Senate consideration. 
I will vote for the Credit Union Membership Access Act. It is the right thing to do and the Senate is overdue in taking this action. This legislation clarifies credit union membership in a manner that protects consumers and the competitive financial services industry. In the Senate bill, existing credit union members are grand-fathered into their current credit unions and new common bond criteria are established for future growth in the credit union industry. 
Mr. President, the credit union legislation is widely supported by consumer rights organizations including the Consumer Federation of America and the American Association of Retired Persons. Other key supporters of this legislation include the National Farmers Union, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the National Association of Counties, the Fraternal Order of Police and the American Small Business Association. Perhaps most noteworthy to me is the strong support of my constituents for this legislation. Thousands and thousands of credit union members have contacted me, hundreds have visited my office with personal credit union anecdotes, and numerous others have approached me on my travels through Washington state. This issue has resonated with my constituents who value and want to preserve and protect credit unions and the services they provide. 
Importantly, with the August recess approaching and the 105th Congress soon to adjourn, we still have time to get this legislation to President Clinton for his signature. That must be the Senate's objective today; to get this legislation to President Clinton so that we may address the field of membership situation created by last February's Supreme Court decision. 
The Senate did make a number of important changes to the House passed bill. For example, the Senate version of credit union legislation includes new provisions to protect the soundness of credit unions, new capital standards and prompt corrective action for undercapitalized institutions, limitations on commercial lending, new accounting and auditing procedures, and community reinvestment requirements. 
While I support the Senate Banking Committee's efforts to improve the House adopted bill, the field of membership issue is really what this bill is all about. The Senate should not lose sight of this objective and certainly, the Senate should not let additional issues imperil this bill. Therefore, I will vote against the amendments to this bill; some of which have been described as killer amendments, and others that will complicate final passage of this bill. 
I urge prompt passage of the credit union legislation.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise humbly to pay tribute to Officers Jacob Chestnut and Special Agent John Gibson--and all of their fellow Capitol Police officers and law enforcement officers across the nation and world. 
As I filed past the bodies of our slain officers in the rotunda this morning, I was overwhelmed by the sacrifice they made to protect us, our families and fellow citizens. So many times, we take law enforcement for granted because we see them every day monitoring entrances, patrolling the Capitol, just being there. And, thankfully, we don't often see events like the tragedy that occurred on Friday. 
But events like those on Friday do happen. They happen every day across this great nation. Law enforcement officers sacrifice their lives so we can live more safely and freely. Every time that happens, I remember the commitment they have made and I thank them. 
When such madness strikes at our nation's symbol of democracy, it should remind us even more that freedom comes at a price. Our citizens and people of all lands are welcome to visit our capitol and participate in the democracy that they help sustain. They can watch Members of Congress undertake the people's business from the galleries above the two house chambers. They can visit us in our offices. They can visit sacred monuments and historic sites. 
Just last Wednesday, at a coffee I held for visiting constituents from Washington State, one tourist exclaimed how impressed she was with the accessibility of the Capitol, with the openness of the process and the ability to meet and see her Senator and Representatives. I agreed that we have a wonderful system and I praised her for taking advantage of that openness and participating in our great democracy. 
But we have defenders of this democracy and openness. Those men and women are our police officers who try to find that perfect balance of an open society and a safe society. Sometimes that balance means lives are sacrificed to protect those noble goals. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of Officer Chestnut and Special Agent Gibson. This is such a tragedy. As I have read about their lives and families and commitment to their communities, their sacrifice was made even more real. They are true heroes. 
So, I thank them and I thank the Capitol Police. I honor their service. I will use this tragedy to make sure I remember the tremendous commitment our law enforcement officers have made to us: To keep us as safe and when we are in danger, to lay down their lives for us.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Head Start program has successfully served hundreds of thousands of children over the past 33 years. These are children who otherwise would have been left behind. Instead, they received an enriching opportunity to get prepared for elementary school. 
It is critical that we allow local Head Start providers to continue to focus on their mission of serving families and children first. They serve our most vulnerable populations. We need to make sure that we do not saddle Head Start with the additional responsibilities that some members have proposed. Responsibilities such as determining paternity, or enforcing welfare laws by verifying TANF requirements, are duties which are within the realm and expertise of social workers and other professionals. Requiring Head Start to handle these burdensome responsibilities would take their time, energy and focus away from serving families and children first. 
We are finding that the quality of instruction and programs at Head Start continues to improve. We must continue to improve quality. One major concern is the authority given to private companies in this bill. While for-profits are partners with many Head Start grantees, their profit-making goals are not wholly consistent with the mission of serving the public good. 
Mr. President, in June, 1995, several respected researchers from Yale University and other universities issued a report comparing the quality and cost outcomes between for-profit and non-profit centers. The research shows that non-profit centers on average have more teachers with Associates of Arts in Early Childhood Education degrees than for-profit centers. 
Futhermore, for-profit centers on average had lower quality scores but higher costs per child than non-profit centers. Also, for-profit centers make very little use of volunteers from the community. I fear that for-profits are not about quality and community. 
Mr. President, presently under 50 percent of the eligible population is served by the Head Start program. It is important that Head Start continues to expand and serve a greater number of children. However, during these times of welfare reform, it is also necessary that Head Start provide full-day, full-year programs for working families. In order to achieve both goals, it is important that expansion occurs cautiously. 
Overall, the bill allows flexibility and focuses on school readiness and should be supported. Head Start is one of the most important investments we can make in our children.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my strong support for S. 2307, the Department of Transportation's Appropriations Bill for FY 1999. This funding comes at a critical time for our nation and in particular, Washington state. 
Mr. President, as I fly home each weekend, I join thousands of other commuters in the Puget Sound Region immersed in daily and agonizing gridlock. Our State Department of Transportation is working furiously to construct HOV lanes, park and rides and additional interchanges. I applaud our State Secretary Sid Morrison for his innovative thinking and leadership during this time of enormous growth. 
Our region's economic boom has brought many advantages, however, its impact on mobility in the region has been dramatic and continually frustrates motorists. This bill will provide much needed relief for our Puget Sound Region and for infrastructure improvements throughout Washington state. I am most pleased that I was able to work with the committee to secure $60 million for the Puget Sound's Regional Transit Authority, known as Sound Move. This will include $47 million for commuter rail between Seattle and Tacoma and $13 million to begin light rail construction. 
Additionally, I want to express my support for the committee's work in funding the Elliot Bay Water Taxi, the Columbia River Marine Fire and Safety Association, ITS systems near Spokane's SR 395, airport improvements at Everett's Paine Field, Boeing Field and the Pullman Airport. These projects are vital to our region's multi-modal planning. The linking of car, bus, bike, ferry, plane, train and pedestrian has become the framework of every infrastructure decision. 
I wanted to personally thank Chairman Shelby and our Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg for their dedicated work. Their combined efforts and leadership on our subcommittee have produced enormous results that will be felt by generations to come. I am pleased to see our commitment to Amtrak, the Coast Guard, FAA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. I am committed to helping this bill remain in conference and urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
Our work today is wonderful news for the millions of Americans sitting right now in parking lots which were once called highways.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations measure. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I can speak to the importance of this legislation and I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for putting this bipartisan product together. 
I could speak to many important provisions in this bill for my constituents. From fisheries to the cops on the street to export assistance, this bill is important to Washington state. But there is one provision in the bill that I wish to give special attention to today. And that's the language to repeal Section 110 of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Act. 
The repeal of Section 110 is one of my highest priorities for the year. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I do strongly support including the repeal in the Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations legislation. 
Section 110 requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop an automated entry and exit system for the purpose of documenting the entry and departure of `every alien' entering and leaving the United States. It was not until after Section 110 became law that Congress became aware of the full impact of this new language. 
As currently written, Section 110 will have disastrous consequences for U.S. border communities whose economies are dependent on border travel, trade and tourism. For example, more than $1 billion dollars in economic activity is generated each day by legal crossings between the U.S. and Canada. More than 116 million people legally crossed the border from Canada in 1996. This travel and economic activity will be discouraged to the detriment of U.S. interests if we impose new restrictions and create additional bureaucratic delays along our shared borders. 
Section 110 will have dire consequences for my entire state and particularly for the residents of Northwest Washington in Whatcom County. In my state, Section 110 will create an invisible barrier between neighbors, families and coworkers who happen to live on different sides of the border. More than $250 million dollars of annual economic activity in Washington state will be threatened. Border infrastructure which is already inadequate and overwhelmed at certain times of the year will be further burdened with new documentation requirements and traffic congestion certain to anger both American citizens and Canadian nationals. It is estimated that Section 110 will almost immediately create a 12 hour backup at the border in Blaine, Washington. 
Section 110 is a ticking time bomb. It's really that simple. The INS does not have the technology, facilities or trained personnel to implement this language. The real explosive issue here is the cost to implement Section 110. The INS is silent on this issue. That's because it will cost billions of dollars to implement the Section 110 time bomb. Let's be very clear on this point, without changes this provision will cost billions of dollars not anticipated by either the Congress or the American people. 
Many of my constituents in Whatcom County will view the repeal of Section 110 as the most significant action taken by the Congress this year. Section 110 is the classic square peg solution for a round hole problem. That's why I've been fighting for more than a year to scrap the disastrous language. 
Last year, I introduced the first Senate bill on this issue. My bill, S. 1205, the U.S.-Canada Economic Friendship Preservation Act of 1997 seeks to exempt Canadians from Section 110. The effort to fix the Section 110 problem has grown tremendously since the introduction of my bill. Communities across Washington state and virtually the entire Northern Border are working to preserve our close ties with our Canadian neighbors. Governors from Washington state, Michigan, Texas, Arizona and others are supporting the effort. Editorials endorsing the repeal of Section 110 have been written all across the country including The Bellingham Herald, The Seattle Post Intelligencer, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and The San Diego Union Tribune have all criticized Section 110. Numerous Chambers of Commerce and other business and community groups from all parts of the country are supporting the repeal Section 110 effort. 
Various legislative efforts have garnered bipartisan and broad support. I am also an original cosponsor of Senator Abraham's legislation addressing Section 110 and I compliment him for his leadership and advocacy on this issue. Senator Abraham has been a champion in this effort; holding hearings along the border and in Washington, D.C. in his capacity as Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee. I continue to believe the Senate in addition to passing the language in this bill should pass Senator Abraham's stand alone bill on Section 110. 
I commend my colleagues at the Appropriations Committee for taking this action to repeal Section 110. And I urge my colleagues to give this language strong and bipartisan support.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, in urging the Senate to adopt our Internet filtering amendment, the Childsafe Internet bill. 
We come here today for one simple reason: to find a way to protect children on the Internet. The Internet is growing and expanding faster than we ever thought possible. It has become a daily tool for many Americans. As the Internet continues to grow, I believe it is our responsibility to do something to protect children from harmful material. 
I have worked hard over the last 6 years to get computers and technology into our schools. I have sponsored legislation to allow surplus Government computers to be put into schools. The Senate, in fact, just passed my Teacher Technology Training Act, to make sure teachers can incorporate technology into their curriculum. 
I have worked hard to establish the e-rate to help our schools get connected to the Internet. I have been out in schools, and I know personally what a great educational tool the Internet can be. And I represent a state that is leading the way in many of these new technologies. 
I want our students and I want our teachers to have access to this information. But, as we continue to see, there is a small amount of information on the Internet to which children should simply not have access. 
In fact, a 1997 national survey of U.S. public libraries and the Internet revealed that students often unintentionally download pornography while on the Net. Mr. President, 22 percent of the children surveyed admitted that this had happened in school, while 25 percent admitted it had occurred in a public library. 
I understand no solution is perfect. Technology alone won't filter every objectionable item on the Internet. We must remember, though, that this technology has made enormous strides in just a short amount of time. 
I have heard from people who say health information, such as breast cancer, would be blocked from viewing. That may have been the case, but filtering companies have developed new technologies and are employing new procedures that do protect children while allowing more and more educational information to be used. 
Our legislation is a first step. It is the right thing to do. The Childsafe Internet bill would simply require any school or library that gets reduced Internet access, the e-rate, to install some technology on their computers that keeps inappropriate material away from young children. 
What is great about our bill is that it gives power to local school districts and libraries to determine which filtering device to use and what constitutes inappropriate material. Decisions must remain at the local level with those who best know their students. 
Mr. President, let me give a few examples I have heard of the need for the Childsafe Internet Act. 
Last month, a seventh grade teacher in Washington state told me that it was impossible to watch 30 young students at their computers all of the time. She did not want a situation in which a child found inappropriate material, complained to their parents, and then have a parent come screaming back to the classroom, where the teacher was ultimately responsible. She turned off the Internet.

Mrs. MURRAY. My concern is if we don't act now to do something about this issue, teachers and librarians across the country will begin turning computers off, preventing children access to this valuable educational tool. None of us wants that to happen. 
The Childsafe Internet bill is the right way to go. It allows local schools districts to make important decisions about Internet content. It is a common sense solution. We have provided this Internet access through the E-rate. Now we must finish the job by providing our teachers and parents with the right tools to help educate our children. 
Most parents would not send a child to a playground in their local community unsupervised. We cannot allow our young children to be in the Internet unsupervised. 
Lets give our teachers and librarians some help, our parents some control, and truly pass legislation that will protect America's next generation. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I do strongly support the work of Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski. I do not take challenging an appropriations bill lightly. However, in this instance, I feel strongly that I must join my colleagues Senator Wellstone and Senator McCain in seeking to repeal the veterans grab contained in the recently adopted transportation and IRS legislation. 
The bill before us today is a veterans bill. It funds health care and I thank the leaders of this subcommittee for increasing health care funding by more than $200 million. This increase in health care funding is my number one veterans priority. I also strongly support the subcommittee's work on VA medical research, the national cemetery system, and homeless veterans. These are all very important programs. 
However, I continue to oppose the veterans offset used to fund increases in transportation. These cuts have been attached to politically popular bills. The transportation legislation and the IRS reform bill both passed by overwhelming and bipartisan margins. Both were admirable pieces of legislation with the exception of the veterans grab hidden within those bills. 
I have been fighting this veterans grab all year. It was in the President's budget and I opposed it. At the Budget Committee, I voted against Democratic and Republican proposals that included the disastrous cuts to veterans health. And on the Senate floor, I voted against the Craig/Domenici amendment to validate the $10 billion cut in veterans funding and against the budget one final time in opposition to these cuts to veterans. 
Just last week, I asked the Senate to sustain a point of order on the IRS reform bill to support my effort to strike the veterans cuts. That most recent effort failed by one vote. One vote. 
My colleagues need to know that this issue is not going to go away. This issue has touched a nerve with America's veterans. They are deeply offended that the Congress and the Administration would divert money targeted to care for sick veterans to pay for other spending priorities. That's why Senator Wellstone, Senator McCain, Senator Rockefeller, and I will keep coming back. 
Our efforts to repeal the $17 billion veterans grab have been denied through procedural maneuvers. Some may think this insulates them from accountability. It does not. Veterans know that procedural moves are being used to block a straight up or down vote on this issue. 
This amendment is a special opportunity for the Senate. With our votes for Wellstone-Murray-McCain, we can send a very clear message to veterans all across our country. Passage says that the United States Senate recognizes that using veterans funding for other spending priorities is wrong. Passage of this amendment says to veterans that we are moving to restore this funding to where it belongs. The $17 billion belongs at the VA. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Wellstone-Murray-McCain amendment to repeal the veterans cuts associated with the transportation legislation.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the statement my good friend from Idaho, Senator Craig, made about the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coeur d'Alene Basin's pollution problems. I appreciate that he did not offer his amendment, which I would have opposed, because I believe it would have severely restricted the State of Washington's rights to protect its citizens from pollution generated in Idaho. 
At least one version of the senior senator from Idaho's proposed amendment would have given the governor of Idaho veto power over the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to protect the watershed shared by Washington and Idaho citizens. The amendment would have prevented the EPA from even studying expansion of the existing Superfund site without the Idaho governor's permission. 
This is a bad precedent. I know there are many times when decisions made in one state can affect the quality of the water in another state. In this case, the Governor of Washington has publicly stated his support for potential expansion of the Superfund site to ensure all polluted waterways are cleaned up. Why should the governor of Idaho be allowed to thwart efforts to protect the quality of water in Washington? 
I don't think he should. 
Mr. President, I have written a letter to Senators Craig and Kempthorne asking them to work with me to develop a way to ensure we cost-effectively clean up the Coeur d'Alene Basin while ensuring my state's interests aren't jeopardized in the decision making process. I firmly believe we can do this. 
I am committed to protecting water quality in the State of Washington. I believe we could establish a working commission, which would include the federal government, both state governors, and tribes, that could develop a model by which the Coeur d'Alene Basin would be quickly, cost-efficiently, and rationally cleaned up. However, giving one state's governor veto power is not the way to do it. 
I pledge to work with the Idaho delegation, the State of Washington, and concerned citizens to ensure our waters are as pure as they can be. There are few more precious natural resources than water and we all must work to protect it. 
Mr. DAMATO addressed the Chair.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to mention a few topics vital to the educational success and safety of American children. 
Mr. President, last week we saw some real success for American families and students. The Higher Education Reauthorization Act made several improvements that can benefit from more attention; this bill is a major victory for students and teachers across America. My daughter enters college this fall. I now get to experience first-hand the challenges of entering higher education that millions of families each year, and our actions last week were helpful. 
Throughout the Labor Committee's efforts on this bill, I worked to strengthen our Nation's commitment to providing the strongest training possible for K-12 school teachers. I am most pleased with the bill's focus on teacher training, and in particular its emphasis on technology training. 
The bill's provisions concerning student loans will make the dream of higher education that much closer to reality for many potential American college students. The campus safety and child care provisions will make a difference in all our communities. 
I specifically thank Senator Wellstone for his work on the TANF amendment, so important for literacy instruction and lifelong learning. Since our debate on the welfare reform bill in 1996, I have worked with former Senator Simon, Senator Wellstone, and other Senators to point out the vital importance of education and literacy to a person's success in getting off of welfare. The passage of the Wellstone amendment is the right thing to do for low-income working Americans. 
Under the Higher Education Reauthorization Act, I believe that the first generation of the new millennium will benefit immensely from the efforts put forth over this past year. From increases in financial aid, to campus security improvements, to technology instruction, S. 1882 will stand as a proud hallmark of this Congress. 
Mr. President, on other education topics, we still have some large challenges ahead. The House Appropriations Committee is set to have full Committee mark-up of education appropriations this week. The Labor Subcommittee has cut education funding from the President's proposed levels by $2 billion in discretionary spending, and ignored his proposals to improve school construction and class size reduction. This would be the week for House members to eliminate these egregious cuts. 
Let me list a few things the House has put at risk through cuts or eliminations: improving children's literacy; opening school buildings up after hours to make them the hub of the community; getting extra help in reading and math to poor-achieving students; improving education technology, including technology teacher training; getting first-generation students ready for college; and many others. The House has ignored the priorities of the American people. 
The American people care deeply about education. They are frustrated when their schools do not succeed, and they bristle at those who would make it harder for the schools to succeed. This is not about just bricks and mortar, or about throwing good money after bad. This is about priorities, common-sense solutions, and improving quality. 
Do not try to fool the parents. The parents know that school improvement has a cost--in hard decisions, and in hard cash. They know that when Congress offers vouchers and expanded charter schools and bonuses for private schools and private businesses--the Congress is turning its back on the public school. 
They know that a cut is a cut, and that a block grant leads to a cut. They know that nearly the entire discussion this year on education from the other side of the aisle--and a time or two on this side of the aisle--amounts to the empty words of a snake-oil salesman. 
Well, now we have a chance to turn this all around, like the public has forced the Congress to do in years past. Congress cuts the funding for schools, the public groans in disbelief, and the Congress wises up. Let us not wait until September to do it. The House has a chance this week to put back the money they've taken. The Senate will have its chance soon. 
In America, you turn your back on the public school at your peril. What we need to do instead is meet the hard challenges head on. 
The schools, in the inner cities, and in the rural areas, are crumbling. The Congress can do something about it. 
The classes are overcrowded, which adds to the school construction problem. The Congress can take action. 
The budgets have been cut and cut, and failing a local levy can mean disaster for a school. The Congress can keep its hands off the school budget, and restore these House cuts. 
The Congress can increase national expenditures to more than the meager 2 percent of the national budget it now sets aside for schools. And the Congress can set the right tone. 
Rather than generating empty air that has the effect of chipping away at support for the local public school--the very foundation of democracy, citizenship, and community in this nation--the Congress can speak the words that need to be said. 
The responsibility of serving as a member of Congress, as a member of the United States Senate, is weighty indeed. By our words, our signature, and our actions, we can take steps to improve our nation's schools and our student's futures. 
We can set an important tone, and say the hard things that the students, families, teachers, school officials, community leaders and others need to hear. We can also talk of success. 
But if we act and speak only to tear the fabric of support for the public school--if the tone we set is only to chip, chip, chip at public confidence in an institution they know personally to have value--then we are abdicating part of our great responsibility as Senators. 
Americans know that members of Congress can work together, and achieve results. They know we could take actions to improve their public schools. And that is why it is so disheartening to me when Republicans or Democrats put ideology or politics or mean-spiritedness in the way of success for our students. We must act together to do what is in the best interest of all children. 
It is also important Mr. President that we conduct background checks and adequately screen our teachers to make sure they are qualified, competent and capable of providing our children with the quality education they deserve.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment as a cosponsor of the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998. Mr. President, this is a bill that simply, but importantly, provides funding to states and local communities so they can conduct quality criminal background checks. This bill assures parents that dangerous adults will not be employed by their child's school or child care facility. 
There is no doubt that most children today head off to school or are dropped off at child care and are supervised by competent, qualified, caring adults. But as our society becomes increasingly violent, parents need the assurance that when their child is under another adult's care, steps have been taken to assure that the care-giver is qualified and competent and safe to take care of their child. 
Mr. President, we sit in outrage when television newscasters report yet another story of a child who has been abused or molested when parents thought they had found a safe place to take their child. Nothing frightens a parent more than a report of a child who has been abused by a predator--molesters, abusers or pedophiles. 
We do not have to sit and wait, Mr. President. We can and must do more. We have the laws to better screen those who care for our children. Let us use them. We must protect our children and see to it that they grow up in a safe environment. No child should ever suffer these kinds of traumas. That is why Mr. President, I am cosponsoring the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998. I believe this bill is a strong step to accomplish the type of protection that is needed. 
We have a right to expect that those people to whom we entrust the care of our children are decent, upright, trustworthy individuals. Parents have a right to know that anyone who comes in contact with their children in an unsupervised environment has been appropriately screened. We have a right to know that anyone with a criminal history of child abuse, molestation and sexual crimes against children will be prevented from being in a position where they have access to our children. 
In this highly mobile society we live in, we know that abusers move easily across state boundaries seeking jobs in places where they think their past will not catch up to them. If schools or child care providers only check in-state applicants for state criminal convictions--and do not require a fingerprint check which can be scanned against a national clearinghouse of convicted criminals--they have not adequately screened applicants before hiring them to oversee our children. 
In fact, Mr. President, a case that prompted the passage of laws requiring national criminal background checks in my home State of Washington, involved the arrest of a social worker who possessed hundreds of photos and videotapes of young boys engaged in sexual activities. He was charged on 40 counts of possession of child pornography. 
The investigation began after one of the adolescents under his supervision accused him of sexual abuse. When the social worker was hired, a background check of this man was `clean' and reported `no past problems.' However, he was previously employed by a state agency far away, across state lines in Texas. Although the Washington state agency checked his references in Texas, they did not check to see if he had a criminal history in any other state. 
The background check did not extend beyond the borders of Washington state. State officials at the time admitted they had no routine way of determining whether any state worker had ever run afoul of the law outside Washington's borders. 
As a result of this incident, the Washington State Legislature closed this loophole by passing laws requiring national criminal background checks on workers and volunteers who deal with vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and disabled. 
More recently, at a Washington, D.C. day care center, a substitute security guard was filling in for the regular guard, who was sick that day. That afternoon, the substitute guard was arrested on the premises--allegedly an accessory to murder a few months earlier. 
In this case, the security firm failed to screen the worker adequately. He was a resident of Maryland and the firm only checked state records which revealed no criminal record. However, the substitute guard had a long rap sheet in Washington D.C., which the security firm did not check. The failure of this security firm to conduct a background check of the neighboring state's jurisdiction put 70 children at tremendous risk. 
It is imperative that we stop interstate movement and let abusers know that their backgrounds will be checked, their applications will be screened and national and state fingerprint checks will be conducted where appropriate. In addition, it is essential that we provide funds to the states so they can update their criminal history records and provide timely information when it is requested. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, we live in a time that requires us to protect our children by screening and checking the backgrounds of volunteers and other people who have access to our children. Statistics reveal that 46 percent of child molesters are non-family members who are known to their victims. These are `trusted' adults, such as teachers, scoutmasters, coaches, clergy, counselors and neighbors. As parents, we must be concerned about the people who have access to our children. The bottom line is that strict screening mechanisms and criminal background checks are vital to the safety of our children. 
Mr. President, I am cosponsoring this bill because it provides grants to the States for programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal justice purposes. These purposes include screening youth service employees, volunteers, and other individuals in positions of trust--if authorized by federal or state law and administered by a government agency. This bill also promotes enhanced communication nationwide between local, state, and national computer systems for domestic violence and sexual offender identification and registration systems. 
The Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 is also important because it provides necessary funding to the States so they can upgrade their criminal history record systems and improve criminal identification of sexual offenders. 
Mr. President, this bill is an effective way to stop pedophiles from stalking our children under the guise of employment or volunteer activity. It will also help States protect their children by letting sexual predators know that background checks and screening mechanisms will be conducted wherever they move. 
It is imperative that would-be employees not be able to avoid detection during background checks by failing to report their criminal past. The Raleigh News and Observer reported on January 8, 1997 that Terry Dondrell Howie pled guilty to being an accessory to a murder, at the same time he worked taking care of toddlers at a local day care center. 
Howie was fired from his job at the day care center, three days after he was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in a deadly car-jacking. Although a state law that requires annual background checks would have eventually caught his felony charges, day care employees facing felony charges can escape detection for months. 
There is no requirement that a lengthy background check be completed before a hiring because of the high turnover on day care center staffs. 
This can be a fatal practice that must be changed. Take the tragic case of 18-year-old Michelle Montoya, who--in 1997, as a senior in Rio Linda High School--was brutally raped and killed in the school's wood shop by a substitute janitor with a felonious past. The janitor was put on-the-job before fingerprint tests were completed. He had served time for voluntary manslaughter and just prior to the murder of Michelle, he had been paroled. Although California has since passed legislation prohibiting school districts from hiring employees before background checks are complete, the same is not true in every state. 
As parents we expect our schools and day care centers to protect or children. We must provide the funding and the attention necessary to correct this problem so that other families do not suffer the same kind of horrible tragedy and loss as the Montoya family. 
Mr. President, we cannot take any chances when it comes to protecting our children. We must do everything we can to ensure their safety and protection which is why I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to S. 2271, the bill before the Senate this evening. I do so knowing that I have the support of the vast majority of Washington State voters who, 3 years ago, soundly defeated a radical and dangerous referendum that is very similar to the bill that is before us today. In 1995, the people of Washington State overwhelmingly rejected a referendum that would have put developers and resource exploiters ahead of the rest of us. They defeated this proposal because they knew it really only amounted to one thing: a massive tax increase on regular people. Developers and their supporters would have us pay for the right to a high quality of life and strong communities, whereas today we enjoy these things as a result of basic zoning laws and environmental standards. 
While the measure before us differs somewhat from Referendum 48, its underlying motive does not. Developers somehow believe that they are being denied their property rights by having to work through local and State land use laws. And, to be fair, there have been some isolated cases in which a maze of laws has thwarted reasonable environmentally sensitive projects. I personally will continue to urge local and State governments to streamline their processes to fix these occasional problems. 
But, basically, the system works. It is simply not broken, and this bill is not necessary. 
Mr. President, the most objectionable provision in this bill is that it allows developers to short-circuit local administrative, zoning, and other land use procedures. This promises to send increased litigation against already strapped local and State governments. This means more taxes, both to fund the court battles and, if local governments lose, to pay off developers to protect our quality of life. In addition, simply the threat of a Federal court may drive a town to acquiesce to a developer's demands, because they cannot afford to go to court and fight to protect their local land use decisions. 
Frankly, I am surprised at the support this bill has gotten from those who traditionally would defer to local government making decisions on how best to use land and instead give that decision making authority to Federal courts. This seems like quite a reversal. Frankly, it seems particularly odd, given the Senate's backlog in filling Federal court vacancies. 
While we have moved two of our Washington State candidates--Margaret McKeown and Ed Shea--both Senator Gorton and I are pushing very hard to get another circuit court nominee, Ron Gould, and a district court nominee, Bob Lasnik, heard and confirmed. Another district court judge is set to retire in the near future, creating another vacancy. I have to ask, Why is the Senate increasing Federal caseloads with this bill while simultaneously not filling empty seats? 
That issue aside, this bill is not what this country needs. We do not need to undermine our Nation's laws that protect public health, safety, and the environment. There are usually very good reasons why development is prohibited in certain areas. It could be safety; the area could be prone to flooding or to landslides. It could be protection of water quality. It might be protection of threatened endangered species or ecosystems. And, in those cases where a local, State, or Federal entity does unreasonably and actually take a private person's property for a public good, we have a well-established legal system to provide compensation. And that system is working. 
Let me close by reminding everyone that the Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties, and the National Conference of State Legislators oppose this legislation. In addition, every conservation group I am aware of opposes this. This is simply not good public policy. 
I am committed to keeping the Pacific Northwest beautiful. I am committed to ensuring my constituents have the power to enact reasonable zoning ordinances to protect their water and environmental resources. I do not believe their taxes should be used to pay off developers. 
I pledge to my constituents to work to ensure that the reasons we are all so proud to call Washington home remain intact. This bill would limit our ability to protect the things we hold precious, and I will vigorously oppose it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I reserve the remainder of our time.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is imperative that we preserve Pakistan as an export market for our wheat. Washington State wheat growers need this bill. Our wheat prices right now are beneath the cost of production. Our growers and the rural communities they support are, frankly, losing the shirts off their backs. 
There are now 3,500 wheat farms in eastern Washington; that is 3,500 wheat families. These families are the backbone of our rural economy. In Douglas, Lincoln, and Adams Counties, in Ritzville and Garfield, our growers need export markets like Pakistan so they can keep going. Every day we are losing family farms, and it is imperative that we do something about it. 
This bill doesn't just affect farmers, it affects our truckers, it affects our ports, it affects our barge operators, and all of their families as well. 
Given the evolving market forces in south Asia, it is really critical that we pass this bill today to give wheat growers in Washington State, the Northwest, and the Nation the chance to compete with other suppliers who are just waiting to take our customers. 
No one condones the actions of either Pakistan or India earlier this year. The proliferation of nuclear weapons must not be allowed. The Arms Export Control Act of 1994, passed overwhelmingly by Congress, and requires that sanctions be imposed on these nations. 
But the original act excluded food and humanitarian assistance. Unfortunately, the export credit guarantee programs of USDA essential to sale of food to poorer nations like Pakistan were not excluded. 
Last month, during committee consideration of the Agriculture appropriations bill, I passed an amendment to explicitly exclude these export credit guarantees, most notably the GSM-102 program, from the sanctions. 
Unfortunately, because of recent developments here on the floor, this amendment on agriculture will not be enacted into law soon enough to prevent the loss of this important export market. 
Pakistan recently announced that they will tender for 350,000 metric tons of white wheat on July 15 for an August shipment. Without access to the GSM-102 credit guarantees, United States wheat producers will not sell a single kernel of wheat to Pakistan. 
In recent years, Washington state wheat producers, in fact, Pacific Northwest growers, have sold more than one-third of their wheat to Pakistan. Washington state and other Pacific Northwest states produce almost exclusively white wheat, making Pakistan out number one export market. 
Washington wheat needs this export market. This is a $300 million market for Washington wheat. 
If we do not enact this legislation by July 15, we will lose not only the ability to bid on this tender, but potentially the entire Pakistan market, as other nations step in to fill the void. 
That is why we are bringing this amendment as a stand-alone piece of legislation this afternoon. 
If we do not pass this bill and preserve this important wheat market, the United States reputation as a reliable supplier of high quality wheat will be weakened and our competitive advantage in the global marketplace undermined. 
That is why this Congress must act now.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, agriculture is in crisis. The bottom has fallen out of the agriculture economy. Many of our growers are on the verge of bankruptcy. In fact, many have already gone over the edge. 
We are losing family farms and we are losing the rural way of life. 
Many in this chamber argue that trade is the answer. Trade is important, critically important. Pacific Northwest agriculture depends upon vigorous trade promotion. 
I am a strong proponent of trade. But trade is not enough. 
The 1996 farm bill took away the safety net for our growers. The old farm bill needed to be changed. And Freedom to Farm made some important changes. But it went too far and now growers are suffering. 
While a market-based approach creates freedoms and opportunities in a competitive global market, some semblance of a safety net is necessary to ensure our growers survive the ups and downs of a volatile market. Congress needs to take action to protect agriculture and preserve rural communities before it is too late. 
And this bill is an important step. Maintaining our export markets is essential to our long-term success. I urge the Senate to approve this legislation. 
I retain the balance of our time.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 1882, the Higher Education Reauthorization bill. This bill is a major victory for students and teachers across America. As a member of the Committee, I have had the opportunity to hear from countless witnesses from across the nation who have testified on everything from default rates to job hunting, campus crime to child care. With a daughter entering college this fall, this issue has provided me with some very interesting insights into the higher ed challenges, millions face each year. 
Throughout the Labor Committee's effort on this bill, I worked to strengthen our nation's commitment to providing the strongest training possible for school teachers. I am most pleased with the bill's focus on teacher training and in particular its emphasis on technology training. A year ago, I introduced the Teacher Technology Training Act to add technology to the areas of professional development and teacher training included in current law. S. 1882 now contains my legislation, and I thank Chairman Jeffords, Senator Kennedy and Senator Warner for their cooperation and support in adding this critical piece to the bill. 
The work of the committee on the teacher education provisions is really quite historic and a drastic overhaul of the previous teacher training section. The bill provides Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants that will institute state-level reforms to ensure both current and future teachers possess the skills and academic knowledge to teach children effectively in their assigned area. As a member of the Labor Appropriations subcommittee, I will fight to ensure that this section is finally funded at a level that does make a difference in the classroom. 
This teacher quality section particularly highlights training in the effective use of technology in the classroom. All of us have witnessed the tremendous impact that technology now plays in our daily world. It affects the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and the way our children learn in school. 
Young people today are in the midst of a technology explosion that has opened up limitless possibilities in the classroom. In order for students to tap into this potential and be prepared for the 21st century, they must learn how to use new technologies. But all too often, teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their instruction without being given the training to do so. Many students in our public schools have told me they know more than their teachers about how to use computers. 
We can not continue to rely on students to teach teachers in the rapidly expanding area of technology. I have toured several teaching schools and found them well supplied with up-to-date equipment. However, student teachers are often not provided adequate instruction in the use of that technology beyond simple communication purposes. It is not enough for a teacher to be able to email or use computers merely for administrative reasons, they must be able to use this education technology to advance their curriculum and provide their students resources along the information highway. 
Last year, just 10 percent of new teachers reported that they felt prepared to use technology in their classrooms, while only 13 percent of all public schools reported that technology-related training for teachers was required by the school, district, or teacher certification agencies. Currently only 18 states require pre-service technology training. 
This act will significantly turn these numbers around and provide our teachers with the training so critical to harnessing new technologies. I again thank Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their leadership on this effort. This technology training for teachers has been supported by a wide array of interests including the National Education Association, PTA, Society for Technology in Education, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National School Boards Association, Information Technology Association of America, Washington State School Directors, the Software and Digital Alliance, the Colleges of Teacher Education. I also would like to thank Senator Wellstone for his work on the TANF amendment, so important for literacy instruction and lifelong learning. 
With increased Pell Grants and decreased interest rates on loans, students can begin to think about their future rather than paying for their past. I believe this first generation of the new millennium will benefit immensely from the efforts put forth over this past year. From simplifying the financial aid process to campus security improvements to technology instruction, S. 1882 will stand as a proud trademark of this Congress.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me begin my remarks today by reiterating my strong support for the underlying bill that is before us to reform the Internal Revenue Service. This is a good bill and it is really long overdue. I want to join my numerous colleagues who have complimented Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan and others who have worked very hard and long on this legislation. I have listened to my colleagues all day talk about the benefits of that bill, and I add my comments to that in support of that as well. 
Despite my strong support for this underlying bill, I am deeply concerned about title IX of this conference report, because hidden deep within this bill in title IX is language to take some $17 billion from America's veterans. Several of my colleagues have been addressing this issue today, and I associate myself with the remarks of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Durbin. I know Senator Wellstone has taken quite a bit of time to outline what is in this bill, and I thank him for his words, his comments, and his support. 
Title IX is the technical corrections language for the transportation legislation. Hidden within that is a provision that takes away disability benefits from veterans whose illness resulted from smoking. Many of these veterans, as my colleagues know, were encouraged to smoke during wartime service with free cigarettes that were provided by our armed services. I am outraged by this language, and I am sure that many of my colleagues in the Senate are as well. I know Senator Chafee, who is the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, has spoken to this issue. I have immense respect for Senator Chafee and for his leadership in crafting the very important TEA 21 legislation, the transportation bill that passed. Transportation is a critical and important issue. 
However, let me be very clear. I continue to oppose the veterans offset used to fund the increases in transportation. The chairman argued that this is not a controversial matter, that the Senate has already spoken. With all due respect, I disagree. If this issue is so noncontroversial, why are we debating it within the IRS reform bill? This legislation has nothing to do with the veterans bill. If this issue is truly noncontroversial, then let's have a stand-alone debate on the issue of cutting $17 billion in veterans' benefits. The technical corrections bill is at the desk. We could have a time agreement on that. It could pass very quickly. It does not need to be included in the IRS reform legislation. It has nothing to do with the IRS reform legislation. 
I ask, and I believe all of my colleagues should ask the question, Why on Earth is the IRS reform legislation used to take money from our American veterans? It is a very legitimate question. The original Senate version of the IRS reform did, of course, not target veterans, and neither did the House bill, the IRS reform bill. Somehow the conference committee agreed to add the technical corrections for the highway legislation to this bill on IRS reform. I am assuming that this action was taken at the direction of leadership, since I know that the Finance Committee does not have jurisdiction over the veterans funding issue. The IRS bill is viewed as politically popular and a cinch to pass. That, I would guess, is why the veterans cuts 
were added to this bill. The proponents of this veterans grab want to avoid accountability. That is wrong, and that is why I am opposed to title IX of the underlying bill being included in this bill. The proponents figured that we would just roll over and accept these wrongful cuts because everyone wants to reform the IRS. 
I have been fighting this veterans grab all year. It was in the President's budget, and I opposed it. At the Budget Committee, I voted against Democratic and Republican proposals that included these disastrous cuts to veterans health. On the Senate floor, I voted against the budget one final time in opposition to these cuts to veterans. During consideration of the budget, I was pleased to join with Senator Rockefeller and others to fight against these cuts. I voted against the Craig-Domenici amendment to validate the $10 billion cut in veterans funding. Sadly, the Senate budget resolution paved the way for the transportation bill to use the veterans savings to offset the increased transportation funding. 
I want to be sure that my colleagues are aware that the technical corrections language punishing veterans that is included in this IRS bill is opposed by virtually every veterans service organization. Many of them have written and contacted me in opposition to the cuts, including the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the Disabled American Veterans. 
Senators need to know that this issue has touched a nerve with America's veterans. They are deeply offended that the Congress and the administration would divert money targeted to care for sick veterans to pay for other spending priorities. This issue is not going to go away. America's veterans and many in Congress will continue to fight this battle. We simply must revisit this issue and do the right thing for America's veterans, and the time is now. The best way to do that is to remove the language from this nonrelated IRS reform bill and vote on the issue separately.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Legion again urges all U.S. Senators to reject this language targeting veterans. I implore all Senators to review this letter before casting a vote today on this issue. I am here to urge my colleagues to join me and others to free America's veterans from the IRS reform legislation. Free the cuts in Veterans Affairs to a genuine and a very public debate. 
We are going to have a vote on this issue today. Regardless of whether it is procedural or a straight-up vote, one thing is very clear--it will be a veterans vote. I ask my colleagues to vote with me and with America's veterans.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me simply say the chairman states correctly that the transportation bill did go through in a hurry right before a recess, and we are now looking at technical corrections to that bill. That bill is at the desk, and we should have an opportunity to take a look at it, offer amendments, and vote it up or down. 
Being as it is included within the IRS conference report, we don't have the ability to do that. I think many Members would very much like the opportunity to speak out on this issue. As we went home for the Fourth of July recess, many people heard from veterans in their States who are outraged this was included in the transportation bill. They would like the opportunity to make their voices heard on that. 
If we are able to override the ruling of the Chair, we will have the opportunity to do that. That is simply what we are asking for today. It will not hold up the IRS reform bill. We can simply move that next week. It will allow Members to make their statements known and their views known on a very critical issue to many veterans in our country.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mrs. MURRAY. I know the Senator from Rhode Island wants to move to a vote on this. Let me just conclude by saying that veterans know this issue very clearly. They know that the language we have included in the IRS reform validates the cuts to their ability to get health care, if they were smoking when they were young and they now have disabilities due to that. 
They are very clear on this vote. They are very clear in what they are saying to us. They were very clear to me over the last month. This bill, if we vote on it this way, will cut the health care benefits of many of our service people who started smoking when they were young. 
I think that the veterans are going to be watching this issue closely. I hope that my colleagues will support me on this so that we can move to separately deal with the technical corrections bill in a way that does not undermine the health care benefits of the many veterans across this country who served our country well.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am so pleased we are finally acting to send this bill to the President. This important legislation has been delayed long enough. It has been over a year since the Kerrey/Portman IRS Reform Commission reported their findings to Congress and the American people. The Commission's report was extremely clear. The IRS had become a monster agency feared by law abiding citizens. It acted with total disregard for the rights of American taxpayers and ruled not through law or practice, but fear and fear alone. 
I urge swift Senate action on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. The American people cannot afford any further delay or political grandstanding. The House passed their bill on November 5, 1997 and we passed a reform bill on May 7, 1998. We should have been acting on a final conference report months ago. Unfortunately, despite the extensive analysis contained in the Kerrey/Portman Commission's report, some in Congress chose to engage in partisan politics using IRS abuses as a mechanism for talking about the evils of `big government.' The American taxpayer deserved better. 
The problems at the IRS are not about `big government' but rather an agency with a conflicting mission and little guidance from Congress. In each Congress, new and in some cases sweeping changes in the tax code are enacted into law. The IRS must then swiftly implement these complex and difficult changes in the tax code. Excessive contracting restrictions and little managerial oversight results in an actions that border on the extreme. 
I am pleased to have supported historic taxpayer Bill of Rights provisions in the 1993 deficit reduction plan. But, it became obvious from the Kerrey/Portman Commission report that additional taxpayer protection reforms were necessary. We could no longer allow the agency to rule by fear. American taxpayers should not fear challenging any decision made by the IRS. This should be the right of every American to challenge any decision by any federal agency. If an individual feels that the Social Security Administration erred in denying benefits, this individual can challenge this decision without fear of retaliation. No one should ever fear challenging the decision of any federal agency. But, sadly this had become the case with the IRS. 
Many taxpayers simply were convinced that they had no choice but to submit and pay the often times excessive penalties and interest demanded by the agency. There simply was no assumption of innocence. 
Taxpayers need this bill. This is not about those who do not honor their financial responsibilities. It is about protecting those that voluntarily pay their fair share. It is also about providing guidance to the agency responsible for implementing the laws that we pass. It is about 
leveling the playing field to ensure that taxpayers have the same rights and protections when dealing with the IRS. 
The conference report adopts many of the provisions included in S. 1096, the original Kerrey/Grassley IRS reform bill which I cosponsored shortly after it was introduced. These provisions are essential if we truly hope to reform the IRS. The legislation will shift the burden of proof in many of the cases in U.S. Tax Court from the taxpayer to the IRS. Under current law, it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to disprove any charges brought by the IRS. This is counter to criminal law and makes it difficult for a taxpayer to disprove charges brought by an agency without almost unlimited resources. The legislation also mitigates interest charges and penalties for some tax cases. No longer with the interest charges and penalties significantly amount to more than that total taxes owned the IRS. 
The conference report also includes new restrictions on the ability of the IRS to seize property. Too many times overzealous actions by the IRS resulted in the seizure of a business or the home devastating working families and leaving no means to repay taxes owed. What is even more outrageous is I have heard of cases where decisions to seize property were later overturned. The seizure of one's economic security cannot be part of a normal enforcement strategy for the IRS. It must be an extreme and final solution, not simply a compliance mechanism. 
I am also pleased that the final agreement maintains an independent board to oversee actions within the agency. I have heard from many IRS employees about internal problems that create major obstacles to reform. An independent board drawing from the private and public sectors will provide some real strategic planning assistance for the Commissioner. It also ensures effective citizen oversight. 
The IRS needs to put the idea of service back into the Internal Revenue Service. Its mission must be to serve the public and provide a cooperative environment for those voluntarily complying with their financial obligation. 
The legislation will make a difference. No longer will a convicted criminal have more rights and protections than an honest taxpayer challenging the IRS. We should have acted many months ago. Every day the Republicans delayed this bill in the Senate resulted in more taxpayer abuses. More fear and more abuse. Today's actions will make sure this all stops. 
Currently, honest taxpayers and business pay an average of $1,600 per person for those who do not meet their financial obligations. An estimated $120 billion a year goes uncollected by the IRS. We should be doing more to encourage more Americans to come forward and meet their obligations. But, so many taxpayers have simply given up. There is wide-spread belief that you cannot find fairness or respect at the IRS. 
We need to give the IRS the tools and the guidance to bring respect back to the IRS. If we want American taxpayers to respect their government we must ensure that they are treated with respect and dignity. The legislation we are not considering meets this test. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting effective and comprehensive IRS reform and restructuring.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment to the Department of Defense authorization legislation regarding burial honors for deceased veterans. I ask that my full statement be made part of the Record. 
Earlier this year, along with Senator Murkowski and Senator Sarbanes, I introduced the Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998. Our bill requires the Department of Defense to provide honor guard services upon request at the funerals of our veterans. Importantly, my bill was crafted with the direct participation of numerous veterans service organizations and has been endorsed by the Former Prisoner of War, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS and the American Legion. 
I got involved in this issue several years ago for a very simple reason. Sadly, all across this country, veterans are being buried without full military honors--honors earned through service to us all. We asked these soldiers, sailors, and airmen to travel to distant shores to risk the ultimate sacrifice. It seems only fair to ask the DOD to travel to a nearby community to remember and honor the sacrifices of our veterans. 
I believe we have a moral responsibility to tell each and every veteran at his or her funeral that we remember and we honor their service to our country. That message is so important to families who have sacrificed so much for our country. 
I can speak personally to the importance of the Veterans Burial Rights. Act. I lost my own father last year, a World War II veteran and proud member of the Disabled American Veterans. My family was lucky, we were able to arrange for burial honors at his service. Having the honor guard there for my family made a big difference and created a lasting impression for my family. We were all--and particularly my mother--filled with pride at a very difficult moment for our family as Dad's service was recognized one final time. 
The Veterans Burial Rights Act seeks to ensure we make the same burial honors available to veterans and families who specifically request the honors at a funeral service. 
Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has opposed the Veterans Burial Rights Act. The DOD has bombarded Capitol Hill with doomsday proclamations about my bill. 
The DOD's stance has been particularly offensive to the veterans of our country. Not only did the DOD oppose a greater DOD role in providing burial honors for veterans, but they even went so far as to suggest the Department of Veterans Affairs should pay for honors taking additional dollars from health care, rehabilitative services and other veterans programs. 
The DOD recently wrote to the Armed Services Committee claiming that a four-person burial honors detail `would have required 12,345 man-years of effort at a cost of $547 million to support the 537,000 veterans' funerals held in 1997.' The last part is a direct quote. According to the DOD, funeral support in 1997 would have required 12,345 man-years and $547 million for 537,000 funerals. I must say, that's impressive accounting for an agency that can't figure out the going rate for hammers and toilet seats. 
The DOD has chosen to fight my attempts to increase funeral support to veterans with funhouse mirrors. The DOD's arguments are based on providing funeral support to every veteran who dies. That's absurd. Veterans know this is not possible, logistics and cost will always be a factor. And most veterans' families will not request the services. The vast majority of veterans' families do not seek burial honors today. We are simply trying to provide burial honors for veterans whose families request the honors. 
The House of Representatives included a version of the Veterans Burial Rights Act in their version of the DOD authorization. The DOD issued an appeal to the House urging the `exclusion' of this language threatening that funeral support would have negative impact on personnel and operational readiness. And I should point out again that the DOD is choosing to interpret our legislative proposals and interest in this issue in the most negative manner. 
From the very beginning, we have sought to leave the DOD with the flexibility to write the directives on funeral support. No one wants to undermine the basic mission of the department. And particularly our veterans who continue to hold the various services in high esteem. But we do believe that the Department and individual services can and should do more on burial honors. We believe all of our assets--from the veterans service organizations to active and reserve components to ROTC cadets all across the country--can be utilized in a comprehensive and cooperative effort to provide burial honors for veterans and families seeking a final, deserved tribute.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, from the very beginning, we have sought to leave the DOD with the flexibility to write the directives on funeral support. No one wants to undermine the basic mission of this Department, especially our various veterans service organizations. They hold the Department of Defense and their service in high esteem. 
Already, veterans across the country are seeking to fill the void left by the DOD's inability to provide burial honors for veterans. Veterans service organizations want to be involved in the funerals of their fellow veterans. And we want them to continue to be involved. But the DOD overlooks this important asset. We are simply saying that VSO's and particularly older veterans cannot meet the demand alone. 
The DOD wants to study the issue. We know that more than 30,000 World War II vets are dying each month and the veterans death rate is increasingly rapidly. We need to act in the short term or America's heroic World War II veterans will be gone before the DOD decides to act. That's why my amendment gives the DOD 180 days to come up with new directives and legislative recommendations for the Congress. Every day we wait, a bit of our history passes away without recognition and gratitude. 
My amendment is very straightforward. It simply calls the DOD's bluff on burial honors for veterans. The DOD will be directed to hold a conference on burial honors by October 31, 1998 in cooperation with the Department of Veterans Affairs and veterans service organizations. Following the enactment of this legislation, the DOD will have 180 days to report back to the Congress detailing new DOD directives on funeral support and burial honors policy and forward to Congress any appropriate legislative recommendations. 
This is essentially what the DOD has pledged to the Congress in opposing more expansive legislation on funeral support. My amendment seeks to hold the DOD accountable to its pledges to the Congress and our veterans. This is a real opportunity to make progress on this issue and I encourage the DOD to make the most of this opportunity. Otherwise, I can assure the Department that we will be back with more definitive language defining what the Congress believes are appropriate burial honors. 
Many of our services have taken a positive role, and I especially commend the Commandant of the Marine Corps who issued a white paper on funeral support. General Krulak, to his credit, says we can and we will honor current and former marines.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, he says: 
Properly laying a fallen Marine to rest is one of the final tributes that the Marine Corps can render to our own. This service provides comfort to grieving families and demonstrates our wholehearted and enduring commitment to those who have earned the title Marine. Unfortunately, I continue to receive letters and E-mails from family members, disappointed that the Marine Corps failed to support them during their hours of need. I am appalled, dismayed and outraged that I continue to receive these letters. Failing to provide funeral support to a Marine, for whatever reason, is completely contradictory to our ethos and diminishes the value of our fallen comrades' service. 
General Krulak goes on to say: 
I want my intent and guidance to ring loud and clear concerning funeral support to families of Marines and former Marines--it is our duty and we would have it not other way! Anything less is unacceptable. 
These are very powerful words and I commend General Krulak and the Marine Corps for making this a priority issue. General Krulak has taken our objective from the very beginning of this effort and turned it into Marine practice each and every day. 
Is it really too much to ask of our country that we do a better job remembering those who answered the call to duty, risked the ultimate sacrifice, and paved the way to the peace and prosperity we all enjoy today? 
Until very recently, I doubted the DOD's sincerity in this effort. We do have a long way to go on this issue, I do think it is important to acknowledge that progress has been made in recent months on this issue. Of course, the Marines are taking a leadership role. But it should also be noted that Army and Air Force are taking positive steps on the burial honors issue. This progress is the direct result of pressure from the Congress, from our veterans, and from the families of veterans who fought for burial honors. 
My amendment is an opportunity to build upon this progress. It's a step forward but I remind my colleagues that we cannot address this issue in steps alone. We need to move quickly, and that's what we are asking the Department of Defense to do. 
I ask the Senate to accept this straightforward amendment. By adopting this amendment and holding the Department of Defense accountable, the Congress will send a powerful message to veterans that their service to us all will never be forgotten. 
Mr. President, I know that this amendment has been accepted by both sides. I thank all of my colleagues for working with us. We are directing the Department of Defense to return definitively, quickly to us with a response to this before it is too late. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski as a cosponsor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Before I speak on this amendment, let me again thank my colleagues for their help on the Veterans Burial Rights Act. This is an important personal issue for me, and I know it is for many families across the country who will be waiting for the DOD report. And I will be working with all of you on whether or not we receive that report in a timely manner. 
Mr. President, the amendment that I have just called up is again to the Department of Defense authorization bill, and it is an effort to protect the health and safety of our military personnel and dependents who are stationed overseas. 
Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to urge my colleagues to support the Murray-Snowe amendment which ensures that female military personnel and female dependents are not subjected to substandard care while serving our country. 
The Murray-Snowe amendment is very simple. It would allow female military personnel and female dependents access to abortion-related services at their own expense--at their own expense--at military hospitals or medical facilities. Our amendment guarantees that women do not surrender their rights to a safe and legal abortion because they are serving our country overseas. Our amendment also ensures that women in the military have access to the full range of reproductive health services. 
The current Department of Defense restrictions that deny women access to safe and legal reproductive health services is not only inhumane, it jeopardizes their lives. This is a women's health issue, plain and simple. That is probably why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports this amendment. The Murray-Snowe amendment has also been endorsed by the American Medical Women's Association, the American Association of University Women, the American Public Health Association, and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. 
Mr. President, I recently received a statement from an active-duty member of the Air Force stationed in Japan which summarized her experience with seeking safe and legal reproductive health services. Her supervisors were of little or no help when she notified them that she was pregnant. They offered no assistance, and they made character judgments. It was only her doctor, a military doctor, who stepped in and tried to help her. Because his hands are tied, due to DOD policy, he could only give her information on locally available abortion services. 
This is a woman who is serving our country, and she is told she is at the mercy of the host country. For no other procedure or life-threatening illness would we allow the Department of Defense to turn military personnel out onto the streets of their host country. But that is what we are allowing for women. 
This is what this particular servicewoman faced. She was given a hand-drawn map with the location of three hospitals that perform abortions. When she arrived at the hospital, none of the nursing staff spoke any English. She had no Japanese friends who could translate, and the Air Force could not provide any assistance. If she had been arrested for armed robbery, the Air Force could have been of more help to her. 
The doctors in the hospital had limited proficiency in English, and one could not even tell her what medication he was giving her. Obviously, there was very little concern about possible reactions to the medication. She was totally at the mercy of these doctors in the host country. 
Her experience was humiliating and frightening. As she 
stated in her letter--and I quote-- 
Although I serve in the military, I was given no translators, no explanations, no transportation, and no help for a legal medical procedure . . . The military expects nothing less than the best from its soldiers and I expect the best medical care in return. If this is how I will continue to be treated as a military service member by my country and its leaders, I want no part of it. 
Opponents of the Murray-Snowe amendment will argue that Federal tax dollars should not be used to provide abortion-related services. I am sure their arguments do not hold up under scrutiny. 
Our amendment simply restores previous policy--previous policy--that allowed female military personnel to pay for abortion-related services at their own expense at our military hospitals. They had to pay for this expense. The hospital or outpatient facility already has to be maintained for the safety of our troops. The cost of operating the facility is already a given. The soldier or dependent would pay for any possible added cost of providing this service. 
Does she pay for the electric or water bill for the facility? No, of course not. And this is where opponents argue that Federal funds are being used to provide abortion-related services. That, I would say to my colleagues, is a real stretch. 
What opponents do not point out is that under existing policy, if a woman feels confident enough to discuss a very private, personal matter with her commanding officer and to request a temporary leave, the military will fly her back to the States or any other location so she can receive a legal and safe abortion. They will pay to transport her halfway around the world if she sacrifices her right to privacy and subjects herself to character assaults and judgments. 
Instead of receiving care at a military hospital on base at her expense, the military will incur thousands of dollars in costs to transport her to safety. This may be why the DOD supports this amendment. They recognize the costs involved in the current policy as well as the threat to the health and safety of our soldiers. 
One has to think that maybe opponents of the Murray-Snowe amendment are really trying to just humiliate women or jeopardize their health and safety. It cannot be that they are concerned about military personnel performing abortions when they object. All branches of the military have included in their code of conduct language allowing for a conscience clause for military doctors. 
They cannot be forced to perform an abortion if they conscientiously object. 
During debate on this authorization bill, I heard many of my colleagues talk about the quality-of-life needs for our soldiers, the need to ensure that our troops receive the support that they deserve. This should be the same standard afforded women soldiers. This is a basic quality-of-life issue. Access to a full array of clinical services for women goes to the heart of quality of life. 
I ask my colleagues to join us in support of our service personnel who so proudly serve our country and ask only for our support and assistance. This is not about publicly financed abortions; this is about protecting the health and the safety of military personnel and their families who are stationed overseas. 
I retain the remainder of my time.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Murray-Snowe amendment. This is a very simple amendment that restores the right of our women and family members who serve overseas in the military to have access to health care services to which they ought to have access. 
Current law in the DOD bill says that a woman who would like to have health care services relating to an abortion would have to ask for permission from her commanding officer to have the military pay for her transport home to the United States in order to get health care services. This amendment simply allows that woman to pay for--out of her own pocket, not at our expense--that service in a military hospital where she is serving overseas. 
Mr. President, this amendment is a safety issue for our women and families of personnel who serve overseas. During the course of the debate, I talked about a letter written to me by a woman who was serving in Japan who had to go to a hospital in Japan where they did not speak English. She did not know what kind of medication she was receiving. Her health care was at risk. She wrote to us seriously questioning whether she would remain in the military after being treated like this. 
This is a service that is legal here in the United States. Women who serve in the military and families of military personnel should have equal access. We are not asking for any taxpayer expense. We are simply allowing women who serve in the military, or families of those who serve in the military, to pay for abortion-related services out of their own pocket, in a safe military hospital overseas. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I thank Senator Snowe for her continued help on this issue.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to join Chairman Burns in recommending for the Senate's consideration the FY 1999 military construction appropriations bill. Through a bipartisan effort, we have created what I think is a very fair and just bill that should please both DoD and my colleagues here in the Senate. 
As he does every year, Chairman Burns had to weigh the priorities of the Department of Defense, the requests of his colleagues, and the recommendations of the Armed Services Committee. He had to do this with an unacceptably low budget request of $7.784 billion, which was $1.4 billion less than the $9.18 billion we appropriated last year. Thanks to Chairman Sevens, that budget request was raised to an $8.48 billion allocation--which we have completely allocated in an equitable and bipartisan way. 
You will find that the budget request yet again tremendously short ended the Guard and Reserve--asking for only $179 million compared to the $390 million we appropriated last year. Thanks to some creative maneuvering and forward thinking, we were able to fund the Guard and Reserve this year at $446 million without disadvantaging any other portion of our bill. 
As Chairman Burns noted, the active components were given $2.57 billion for military construction. In an attempt to fund even more projects, Chairman Burns and I have also created a $200 million package of quality of life projects that has been added to the authorization bill. These adds are included in our bill, and the criteria used in choosing them was that the programs had to be quality of life, had to be in the future year defense plan, and had to represent a broad number of States and services. These are inherently valuable projects, and include improvements to family housing, child development centers, dining facilities, barracks renewal, and physical fitness centers. I encourage all members to support this important initiative to provide a better quality of life to our service men and women. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill--and it's a bill that all of the Senators here should be pleased to support. Again I'd like to thank Chairman Burns for his fair, honest, and excellent work at drafting a bi-partisan and equitable bill. I'd also like to thank and commend his appropriations staff, Sid Ashworth, as well as minority staff in past. Emily East and Dick Diamond for commitment to producing this first-rate bill. I hope my colleagues can join Chairman Burns and me in supporting this bill and voting to adopt it today. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. 
I rise to join with Senator Burns in fully endorsing this amendment to the Armed Services bill. Chairman Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Inouye, Senator Burns and myself have cosponsored this amendment with the sole intention of providing essential quality of life programs and initiatives for our men and women in uniform. 
Increasingly over the last few years, military construction has been given the shorter end of the stick in terms of adequate funding. Congress has always stood by our services, and managed to increase funding where we thought an increase was necessary. 
Again, this year we face a similar situation, with the budget request at $1.4 billion less than what we appropriated last year. The Armed Services Committee significantly bridged this gap by authorizing an additional $500 million in much-needed military construction projects. But we would like to take it a step further and add $200 million for military construction quality of life projects. This would make the military construction budget $8.48 billion, still $700 million less than what was authorized and appropriated last year, but at least $700 million above the less than adequate budget request. 
The projects we have included in this $200 million request are all bonafide quality of life initiatives. We are hearing more and more often 
how our services are struggling with lower than average retention rates. While this shortfall is being addressed through other means, it is also important to address it through military construction. Some of the biggest complaints from our service men and women are regarding things like child care centers. Inadequate housing conditions, old dining facilities, and lack of physical fitness centers. We tried to meet these very real needs in our amendment, providing funds for 27 projects in 22 States. All of these projects are in DOD's future year defense plan, and all of these fall under the criteria of quality of life. Furthermore, the selection of the projects was made in a very bipartisan way. We did not focus on a certain political party or a certain geographical region. Instead, we went to the services and asked them what they needed but couldn't afford. 
Probably at the front of many of my colleagues' minds is the fiasco we had last year with the line-item veto of 37 of our military construction projects and an unfounded concern that these projects may be mere pork. Let me assure you that all of these projects were carefully selected with the threat of the line-item veto in mind. Every single one of these projects has been included in DOD's future year defense plan, and all of these are quality of life projects, meeting the very criteria that the President submitted last year in regards to the line-item veto. Fortunately, the Supreme 
Court has just determined that we won't have to fight that fight again, but it should be reassuring to all here of the thoughtfulness and seriousness in which we chose all of the projects on this list. 
Mr. President, I have to say that it concerns me when I hear criticism of the military construction bill as being `Christmas in July,' delivering `pork' projects to Members. Nothing could be further from the truth, especially for the kinds of projects we're talking about today. First of all, as I just mentioned, these projects are based on the needs of the services, not the requests of Members. Secondly, and most importantly, at the very least, we owe our men and women in uniform a quality of life that is comparable to their civilian counterparts. They should not be compelled to live in inadequate facilities, to travel off-base for child care, to pay for membership in a physical fitness center because their installation doesn't have one. These are small dollar items that will mean so much to so many people. A gesture like this can only but help in quality of life, help in overall satisfaction with the services, help in retention, and therefore help our services meet their force needs and requirements for the 21st century. 
This is a fair, bipartisan, and legitimate means of providing our service men and women with necessary quality of life programs. We have been fortunate to work with our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in ensuring this is an acceptable amendment and an acceptable allocation of resources. I hope and expect this amendment can be fully embraced by the Armed Services Committee, and I encourage my colleagues to support its inclusion. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

As the ranking member on military construction, I assure my colleagues that we have worked very, very carefully this year to go through the numerous requests and the needs of the military. We are extremely aware of the quality-of-life needs of our military, and they are reflected in this amendment that is before us. 
This amendment adds child-care centers, inadequate housing conditions, old dining facilities and lack of physical fitness centers. These are quality-of-life issues. 
I have traveled out and talked to men and women on the military bases. These are the issues they are asking us to address, and these are the ones that are addressed in this amendment. We worked very carefully in a bipartisan way to put these forward. I assure my colleagues we have done it in a fair manner with the needs of the quality of life of our men and women in the military in mind.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I send to the desk legislation to help school districts hire 100,000 well-prepared teachers to combat overcrowding in our nation's classrooms. Few issues are more important to the American family than the quality of our public schools. With challenges like illiteracy, poor work and study skills, and the threat of student violence, what we need are strategies that work to produce results for all students. Increasing the number of well-qualified teachers to reduce class size is an effort that works. 
The research is clear, and the research only backs up what our school communities have long known, that class size reduction improves student achievement. Unlike vouchers and tax schemes that don't provide the benefits for schools or students that they claim--class size reduction works, and it benefits all students. 
Public education is important to the American people, and has been since the beginning of our nation. The public school is one of the most effective self-betterment tools in the history of this country. 
But this bastion of democracy is threatened when public expectation changes, and the public school is not allowed to follow the public will. There was a time not long ago when people with a high school diploma or people who had not graduated from high school could still participate meaningfully in our economy. Those times have changed. 
Americans expect public schools to educate all students to a higher standard, and expect a high school diploma to be accurate assurance that a graduate knows and can do what it takes to succeed in higher education and in today's economy. Most teachers in most classrooms do a good job--and some are clearly gifted. 
But many teachers, excellent in other ways, lack the training, preparation, and know-how to teach reading in ways that reflect the best research. Many otherwise skilled teachers need help to teach today's skills with today's technology. And any teacher has a difficult time getting youngsters ready for today's world when there are more than 30 children in a classroom. 
So the class size reduction bill I'm introducing today puts the funds in the hands of local school districts to train teachers in effective practices, to get uncertified teachers up to certification standards, to provide mentor teachers for teachers who need it, and to improve teacher recruiting. 
Improving class size is an investment in our future that we know will pay dividends. This proposal is still building momentum in Congress. Twice now, this class size proposal has been voted on this year, and the last time it was one vote away from passage. The public is aware that efforts such as the Coverdell IRA proposal do not provide results even for the few students they are targeted to help. Ask any parent or student, and they'll tell you class size reduction works for all students. 
The President had originally talked about funding class size reduction with tobacco revenues, but class size improvement was left out of the bill that left the Commerce Committee. 
With or without a tobacco bill, we can pass the class size improvement initiative and keep a balanced budget. In the President's budget request, there are still more than $20 billion in mandatory and tax offsets we have not yet used. There are several ways to fund a class size initiative, keep a balanced budget, and provide in one action real results for all students. 
Also, as I've mentioned before, this really is an issue of priorities. Yesterday, the House Appropriations Committee took a meat cleaver to social programs, such as elimination of the summer jobs for teenagers, and winter heating assistance for elderly people in harsh winter climates. This year, thanks to the tough decisions I and others here made in 1993 and other factors, we are looking at a balanced budget. 
Now more than ever, the American people priorities are what matter, and they must be reflected in our funding decisions. These are their federal tax dollars we are investing, and education is a much higher priority to most Americans than the two percent of spending it currently holds. 
We have been sending out and continue to send funds to communities so they can hire 100,000 police officers. The communities which have hired these officers have responded with enthusiasm. Allowing school districts to hire 100,000 teachers to school districts will do the same thing--invigorate both the local school district they affect, and the state governments who can fund class size improvement on a greater scale. 
The American people want their national investments to be common sense solutions that work. They want to see national initiatives jump-start real improvements in their local school. They want better teachers, and smaller class sizes. They want to know that when their child goes to school next fall, they are going to get good answers to their perennial questions: `Who's your teacher, and how many kids are in your class?'

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I am delighted that we are here today again to discuss education. It is probably the most critical issue that we have before us in this country. Parents know it. Community leaders know it. Our families across this country want all of us to address the important issues of education so that every child in America, no matter where they come from, have the opportunity to get the American dream in today's society. 
Unfortunately, the bill before us--the Coverdell A+ bill, will only help those people who can afford to put away $2,000 a year. Unfortunately, that will not be a lot for parents out there who are worried about their child's education, or the children in our neighborhoods who we all worry about and whether or not they will get the skills they need to go out in the job market and to succeed. 
Mr. President, there are ways that we can help every child in America get a good education. I have been on the floor many times to talk about the issue of class size, and how too many children are in overcrowded classrooms today and don't get the individual attention that they need in order to succeed. I have had many young people tell me that when they are in a math class with 35 students, they don't get the opportunity to ask their teacher for individual help when they don't understand. Yet, we sit on this floor and decry the fact that too many of our young children today don't get the skills they need in math and science, so they can go on and be competitive in tomorrow's world. We can make a difference if we reduce class size. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a bill to the desk for purposes of introduction today that will address the fact of class size.

Mr. President, the bill I sent to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator Daschle and many other Members, will add 100,000 teachers to our workforce across this country so that we can begin the process of making sure that every student has a well-qualified teacher in a class that has a number of students to whom that teacher can pay attention. 
Mr. President, this is a beginning step that will make a difference for average children across our country. I think it is essential we address many of the issues I have heard my colleagues talk about. 
Senator Feinstein spoke for a moment about violence in school. I have had teachers tell me, I have had police officers tell me there are so many kids in our classes today that they don't get individual instructions. They feel anonymous in our neighborhoods and in our classrooms. And, as a result, we are seeing some of the impacts in our schools today, and we are reading about some of the headlines that we are seeing when violence hits our schools. Reducing class size so that children have individual attention when they need it so they don't feel anonymous makes a difference in addressing those issues. 
I heard Senator Bingaman talk about dropout prevention. He has done an outstanding job. He has been a leader in our Nation in addressing this critical issue of class size reduction so that children get the attention they need, the help they need which will make a difference in dropout prevention. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues today to reject the bill in front of us. It does little; it promises a lot. If we really focus on the issues that parents and students and teachers know will make a difference, we can change what is happening in our country today. We have a responsibility to do that. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I retain the balance of my time.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator Burns and Senator Ashcroft as well as Senator Lott and Senator Daschle for their work and leadership on the issue of encryption. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of S. 2067, the E-PRIVACY Act. 
This is my sixth year as a member of the Senate and the sixth year I have advocated for reasonable legislation on encryption. Sadly, the Administration has not been a constructive player in this debate. It is time for the United States to acknowledge that we no longer exclusively control the pace of technology. Purchasers around the world can download software off of the Internet from any country by simply accessing a website. Foreign purchasers have turned to Russian, German, Swiss and other foreign vendors for their encryption needs. 
Washington state and American companies deserve the opportunity to compete free from unreasonable government restrictions. Their role in the international marketplace should be determined by their ingenuity and creativity rather than an outdated, ineffectual system of export controls. The time to act is now. I urge the Senate to consider the E-PRIVACY Act at the earliest opportunity.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today is a sad day for children across America. Big tobacco companies with unlimited lobbying budgets and Republicans in the Senate killed tobacco reform legislation. Kids lost and Joe Camel won. I am outraged at the message this sends: tobacco money is more important than children's health. 
Almost four weeks ago, the Senate began debating a comprehensive tobacco bill aimed at reducing underage smoking and strengthening the role of public health agencies to combat tobacco. Congress appeared unified in its intent to end the practice of tobacco companies preying on our children. But some of my colleagues in the Senate got lost along the way. 
Since we started debate on tobacco legislation, more than 60,000 children have taken up this deadly addiction. But, this has not been the focus of the debate on this legislation. In fact, if the American people were watching the debate on the Senate floor they would be hard pressed to determine what legislation we were actually debating. That's because the tobacco industry has spent $40 million to hijack the process and prevent Congress from acting. This is a tragic example of our political system at its worst. 
We had an historic opportunity to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation that would have mandated tobacco companies stop targeting our children. In one piece of legislation we could have saved five million children from suffering the ill effects of smoking or facing premature death. Those who acted to kill this legislation will have to answer these five million children, who are now facing a death sentence due to the actions of a few. 
To those who think the state suits are a fall back position, they need to know that these suits do not change the corporate culture of tobacco. The states litigate, and Congress legislates. 
This is a sad day for those of us who have worked hard to advance the tobacco settlement. Throughout debate of this legislation, I voted to strengthen the bill to protect our children and prevent the continued deadly assault of tobacco companies. 
As a parent, I have always been troubled by how tobacco companies target our children. When my son turned 14, he received a birthday card from a tobacco company inviting him to celebrate this milestone by purchasing cigarettes. They sent a child coupons for cigarettes as a birthday gift. This is outrageous and unacceptable. These are kind of tactics that I have been fighting to end. 
I will not let this set back today end my pursuit of big tobacco. I will continue to stand up to tobacco companies. I will continue to work for bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation that is focused on public health. 
This is not the first time I have witnessed the power of the tobacco industry or the hold that tobacco money has on many of the same members of the Senate. It is these very members who have used every tactic known to delay, filibuster and load this bill down with so many unrelated items, that it is hard to remember what was in the original legislation. 
Every parent should be outraged. The U.S. Senate played politics with the health and safety of children in America. Today's action says that tobacco money is more important than the health and safety of our children. Where are our priorities?

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are engaging in one of the most important public health debates of this generation. We have a historic opportunity to enact a comprehensive, national antitobacco strategy to end the plague of death caused by smoking. As I listen to the debate here in the Senate I am discouraged by much of what I hear. This is not about taxes, or tax cuts. This is not about what the tobacco companies get or don't get in the deal. This is not about First Amendment rights or increased litigation. This is about one thing and one thing only. Will we stand up to the tobacco companies for our children? 
Will the U.S. Senate say enough is enough. Will we fight to prevent the deaths of five million children under age 18 who will eventually die from smoking-related disease? Or will we allow the tobacco companies to shape the debate and beat back our efforts to protect children. Today, 4.1 million children age 12 to 17 are current smokers. Isn't this enough for the tobacco industry? Are we going to sacrifice more of our children? 
I have listened very carefully to all sides on these issues. I have been told that a tax that is too high will bankrupt the industry. I have been lobbied by many claiming that without special deals, the tobacco companies will not agree to restrict advertising or will litigate this legislation to death. But, I have also heard from pediatricians; public health officials; former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop; and many Washington State members of the American Cancer Society, who have expressed their concerns by illustrating the human costs of the lies and deceit utilized by the tobacco companies. 
Tobacco kills more than 400,000 Americans every year. More people die in this country from smoking related illness than from AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs and fires. Twenty seven percent of Americans who die between the ages of 35 and 64 die from tobacco-related diseases. Isn't this enough? Why has it taken us so long to get to this point of the debate? 400,000 Americans die each year while we do nothing. 
We owe our children more. I owe the children of Washington State more. I have an obligation to push for the toughest tobacco bill possible. I can promise you that on my watch the tobacco companies get no special deal and that protecting our children is what controls the debate. It is not what can the tobacco companies live with, but is right for our children. 
The tobacco bill that I support will have economic sanctions that will force corporate culture changes by the industry. I will support efforts that penalize the companies if they continue to prey on our children. And I will not support anything that forgives an industry that sold a product that could potentially kill five million children alive today. 
I have made some difficult decisions and votes throughout this process. But, I am proud of my votes to increase economic barriers to prevent children from purchasing cigarettes. I know the tobacco companies hate these kind of barriers. As we discovered in an internal Philip Morris 
document from 1981, `In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers.' There is no dispute on the sensitiveness of children to price increases. Both public health advocates and the tobacco companies agree. The public health community supports these barriers and the tobacco industry fears them. But some in the U.S. Senate disagree that price matters. I stood up and said no you will not addict 3,000 children a day with cheap cigarettes. 
Some of us argue on the floor that without special immunity protection or predictability, the tobacco companies will never accept tough advertising restrictions or consent to FDA regulation. To this I would respond simply by saying if we make the look-back surcharges so tough that without major cultural changes companies will see profits evaporate, we will get our advertising restrictions. If we show that these advertising strategies are aimed at our children we will get these restrictions. We do not need to give special deals that allow tobacco companies to walk away from their responsibilities. 
The tobacco companies have lied to Congress and the American people now they want to negotiate in good faith. In the 1980's, there was legislation in the House of Representatives regarding safe cigarettes. There is technology that would allow tobacco companies to manufacture a cigarette that was almost fire safe. The Safe Cigarette Act, introduced by Representative Moakley was fought at every level by the industry. They claimed that it was not cost effective to make a cigarette that would prevent the tragic death of children in fires caused by a carelessly discarded cigarette. Saving children from a horrific death from fire was not enough of an incentive for the manufacturers to sacrifice some of their billions of dollars in profits. Instead they sacrificed children. 
Now the industry wants immunity. We are supposed to give them caps on their liability and responsibility in exchange they will become responsible corporate citizens. This claim simply has no merit. They do not deserve any special deals. 
Will the tobacco companies challenge these provisions in court? It is hard to imagine an industry that has patented their own brand of litigation and used legal maneuvers to hide their deceit and lies, walking away from another opportunity to challenge restrictions in court. If this industry wants to tie this up in court for years to come, I would say we need to make the look-back surcharges so tough that their own stock holders will not allow this kind of irresponsible behavior. I caution the tobacco industry--if you want to spend the next few years litigating instead of cleaning up your practices you may very well become extinct in the next Century. What would the world be like without the plague of tobacco? Maybe this is what the industry should ask the American people? 
I urge my Colleagues to think long and hard about this debate. We will never get another chance like this one to really make the world a safer and healthier place for our children. Let's side with our children today instead of the tobacco companies.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate in 1993, violence against women had reached a crisis point. The epidemic had spread through every community, across every ethnic group, and did not discriminate based on income, or age. 
In 1994, Congress responded to this crisis. The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 established a national strategy for dealing with this crisis. No longer would this kind of violence be tolerated. Congress made violence against women a federal crime and threw the weight of the federal government behind efforts to end this violence. 
Senator Biden was instrumental in drafting the original VAWA. I am grateful for his efforts in the past and have always appreciated his work on behalf of this issue. I also want to thank Senator Specter for his efforts to funding these important programs. I have worked with him on the Appropriations Committee and have experienced first hand the benefits of having him on my side on an important family violence issue in the 1998 Labor, HHS Appropriations bill. 
Enactment of VAWA in 1994 for me is one of my top legislative accomplishments. I know that we made a difference. I know that providing the resources to help women who are victims of violence seek safety and justice has saved hundreds of lives. I have visited battered women's shelters and talked to many advocates who tell me how important VAWA is. Reauthorization of this historic act must be a priority of this Congress. We can build on the success of VAWA and work to end violence against women. 
I want to thank Senator Biden for working with me to include a prohibition against insurance discrimination in this legislation. I find this practice of discriminating against victims of domestic violence offensive and outrageous. To victimize a woman twice is inexcusable. Insurance policies that deny women health insurance or homeowners insurance simply because they have been victims of domestic violence can no longer be tolerated. To say that a victim of domestic violence engages in high risk behavior similar to a sky diver or race car driver is beyond comprehension. Enactment of VAWA reauthorization legislation will end this practice. 
Believe me, insurance discrimination is a reality. I know of several cases, including one in my own state of Washington, where an insurance company refused to honor its obligation because the loss was the result of a domestic violence situation. There are many more documented cases of discrimination. Insurance companies should be ashamed of this kind of practice. Today we have a means to end it. 
Enactment of this reauthorization legislation is an important step. But, it is only part of the solution. We must do more. We can help ensure that services are available to protect women and resources to local law enforcement to deal with the epidemic. However, the only real solution to ending domestic violence is economic security and stability for the woman. VAWA offers temporary solutions, but long term solutions require tearing down economic barriers for these women. Work place discrimination, lack of affordable child care, housing shortages, punitive welfare requirements, inability to change a Social Security number are all examples of these barriers. 
Removing the economic barriers for victims of domestic violence is our next great challenge. I have been working with advocates in the State of Washington on legislation that would serve to end the economic sanctions many victims face. 
But, first we do need to ensure the immediate safety of these women and their children. We need to provide resources to law enforcement to protect women and we need to guarantee that the courts treat offenders as violent criminals. The legislation that we will be introducing today accomplishes these goals. 
This is one piece of legislation that will make a difference.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am compelled to address the Senate this evening because one of our country's most dynamic, innovative, and successful companies, Microsoft, has been the subject of an unfair and prejudicial target by anonymous sources in the Department of Justice. 
I am concerned that every time I pick up a newspaper I am informed of new information about the ongoing, supposedly confidential proceedings involving Microsoft and the Department of Justice. I ask only for fairness and that whatever verdict is derived, is argued through proper judicial channels and not played out through our nation's media. 
Some of you in this Chamber may say that Microsoft can speak for itself, that is has a voice loud enough to be heard. To that, I answer that no single voice is ever enough to speak over the Department of Justice and those anonymous few employees who are seemingly abusing its formidable power. When the integrity of such a profound legal proceeding is in jeopardy, however, no one should remain silent. 
In the Antitrust Division's extended, intense scrutiny of Microsoft, the company has faithfully worked to comply with each of the Division's request. Microsoft has fully cooperated with the seemingly endless requests for documents and depositions of top executives. Microsoft has operated under the assumption that if it works with the Justice Department in a fair manner and complies with its requests, then the Justice Department will proceed with its investigation fairly. But, I question whether the Justice Department is indeed playing fair. 
Over the past several months, the Antitrust Division appears to have repeatedly and continually disclosed to the media information uncovered during its investigation, and floated anonymous opinions regarding the likelihood of a new government antitrust case against the company. 
To me, putting America's technological leader on trial in the press--before the prosecutor even decides if a trial in our court system should proceed--is wholly unfair. 
The Justice Department's own ethics manual says that, I quote: `It is the policy of the DOJ and the Antitrust Division that public out-of-court statements regarding investigations, indictment, ongoing litigation, and other activities should be minimal, consistent with the Department's responsibility to keep the public informed. Because charges that result in an indictment or a civil action should be argued and proved in court, and not in a newspaper or broadcast, public comment on such charges should be limited out of fairness to the rights of individuals and corporations and to minimize the possibility of prejudicial pre-trial publicity.' 
Based on their comments to the media, however, attorneys at the Justice Department apparently disagree with their own ethics manual. For example in a February 9, 1998 New York Times article entitled `Microsoft Case May Be Prelude to Wider Antitrust Battle' a `senior Justice Department official' who `spoke on condition that he not be identified' said, `licensing arrangements and the pricing of deals that Microsoft strikes . . . for placement on the front screen of its Windows operating system or its Internet Explorer browser' are an `area of antitrust concern' for the Antitrust Division. 
The Wall Street Journal has apparently been given similar exclusive insight into a possible case. On April 6, 1998, the Wall Street Journal published an article entitled `U.S. Closes in on Microsoft; Officials Think Evidence Supports a Broad Charge on Extending Monopoly.' In it, the author quotes `people close to the probe' who stated that `investigators believe they have enough evidence to bring a new antitrust case against Microsoft.' Those sources are so familiar with the investigation that they told the reporter that an antitrust complaint would `repeat an existing charge that Microsoft violated a 1995 antitrust settlement . . . extending to Windows 98 last fall's charge that Microsoft uses Windows as a weapon against business rivals.' 
I regret to say this, and sincerely hope I turn out to be wrong, but I expect that the Justice Department will deny that one of its own lawyers is the source `close to the probe.' I say `expect' because Attorney General Reno does not appear to be looking into this matter, nor has she informed me that the matter has been resolved. In fact, the Practicing Law Institute has advertised that a senior Justice Department counsel would speak about `[the Antitrust Division position . . . on the ongoing Microsoft matter' at an upcoming Intellectual Property Antitrust conference currently scheduled for July 22-23, 1998. 
Mr. President, how does this public speaking engagement by a DOJ attorney square with the Department of Justice's own ethics manual, which states, and I quote again, `public out-of-court statements regarding investigations, indictments, ongoing litigation, and other activities should be minimal?' How does it square with the ethics policy that says, `public comment on . . . charges should be limited out of fairness to the rights of individuals and corporations and to minimize the possibility of prejudicial pre-trial publicity.' I sincerely hope that DOJ staff has been advised against this by Attorney General Reno, but I cannot be sure. 
Just yesterday, I learned that on May 8th, Business Week plans to publish on its website an article with the quote, `sources familiar with the Justice Department case have laid out a detailed plan of attack against [Microsoft].' Who would be able to lay out such a detailed plan about the Department's expected action in the case other than the DOJ itself? 
It is of utmost importance that the Justice Department end this media trial of Microsoft, and restore a thorough and fair process. Today, I have again asked the Attorney General to explain her failure to resolve this matter. 
Microsoft's innovations benefit thousands of companies, employees, shareholders and millions of consumers. With so much innovation and economic growth, and with so many jobs lying in the balance, the least the Department of Justice can do if it proceeds with its investigation is to do so in a fair, professional and ethical manner. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. We have waited too long for the opportunity to debate this issue and move this legislation. Senate action is coming six months after the House overwhelmingly passed this legislation and almost a year after the Kerrey/Portman Commission issued their recommendations for improving and reforming the IRS. 
It is no wonder the American taxpayer is frustrated and angry. What kind of penalty or interest would the IRS levy against a taxpayer who was six months late in filing their taxes? 
Mr. President, the IRS is an agency out of control. I hear this from people all across my state. They want the IRS reformed. And they want it done now. 
What has this six month delay meant to taxpayers? Since November 5, 1997 the date the House voted on H.R. 2676, more than 17 million taxpayers have received a collection notice from the IRS; more than 34 million Americans have contacted the IRS to request assistance or information--of these calls, more than 16 million did not go through and close to 2 million Americans did not get correct answers. 
This is unacceptable. Had we acted back in November, the impact on these families would have been dramatically different. We did not need more hearings, we needed action. 
Since November 1997 I have heard from close to 1,200 taxpayers from my state who have written in support of systemwide reforms at the IRS. They have told me of their experiences and frustrations--and I have to say, some are quite disturbing. 
Mr. President, I want to read some excerpts from a few of these letters--which have come from every corner of my state. They really highlight the abuses taking place by the IRS. 
This comes from a constituent in Moses Lake, Washington. She says: 
We are people who obey the law. If there were things on our tax return which were in error or were questionable, we have no problem with being called to account for it. Nor do we take issue with paying more taxes if we legitimately owed more. However, the way we were treated by a representative of the IRS should never be allowed in any country, let alone ours, which is supposed to be based on presumption of innocence. 
Another letter comes from a constituent in Seattle: 
In 1993, my husband and I bought a franchise and opened our business as sole proprietors. (If we had incorporated, our suffering would be over now). My husband, Craig, had plenty of knowledge and experience in carpentry and built a strong, thriving closet remodeling business. He did not, however, have business tax and accounting training, and he made mistakes in the paying of taxes and filling our paperwork to the IRS. As soon as he recognized his mistake, he alerted the IRS and began to try to make amends. 
It seemed he had awakened a vicious sleeping dog. 
He goes on to say: 
Along with everything else, the IRS randomly cleaned out our bank accounts, as well as those of our children. 
It seems the IRS has an incentive program for their employees which persuades them to take quick, harsh action, trying to `get what they can' and ask questions of the `customer' later. 
Finally, from a constituent in Kirkland, WA: 
For the past seven years both my husband and I have lived our lives under the tormenting cloud of the IRS. 
We had a lien put on our home and the letters began to come of companies wanting to help us with our troubles with the IRS. This was so devastating as we were just starting what we thought would be a beautiful life together. One day I came home to 12 different notices from the IRS I needed to sign for at the Post Office. That is a great way to spend taxpayers' money, don't you think? 
These heavy-handed tactics by the IRS are not acceptable. 
But this is not the first time I have heard from constituents about problems with the IRS. I knew reform was long overdue. It was not until the release of the Kerrey/Portman Commission report that I realized that it was not just a few bureaucrats abusing their position, but rather an agency out of control. An agency with management practices that encouraged abuse of taxpayers; managers who rewarded the most aggressive and unbending employees; and an agency that viewed taxpayers as the enemy. 
Why is it so critical to enact IRS reform? We can all name many reasons why reform is necessary and important, but I think we all have to remember that taxpayers are only trying to meet their responsibilities in a democratic society. They are not turning to the IRS to apply for benefits or for assistance. They are attempting to honor their financial obligation and commitment to a democratic and progressive society. They are not asking for anything in return but to be treated fairly. 
Unfortunately, this is not the experience of most taxpayers. This frustration with the IRS jeopardizes compliance with the tax code and undermines the faith taxpayers have in our system. 
Currently, honest taxpayers and businesses pay an average of $1,600 per person for those who do not meet their financial obligations. An estimated $120 billion a year goes uncollected. We do not need to add to this by encouraging more taxpayers to give up. 
The great thing about this legislation is that it keeps the taxpayer's interest in mind. It simply levels the playing field between the taxpayer, both large and small, and the IRS. What's more effective than forcing the IRS to work in a more fair and even-handed manner? 
I am particularly pleased this legislation provides relief for `innocent spouses' who find themselves liable for taxes, interest, or penalties because of actions by their spouse. This has become a severe problem for many women and children. Following a divorce many women are left to fight the IRS to save their homes and their children's future. Spouses who engaged in illegal activities or misrepresented their income to the IRS simply flee and leave. The IRS then attempts to collect from the innocent spouse--who is often easier to locate--as she has custody of the children. It is a little difficult to hide when you have children. 
The IRS then aggressively pursues these innocent spouses for a debt that they never knew about. If only we could be as aggressive in tracking down the billions of dollars in uncollected child support. 
I urge the Senate to do the right thing today and pass this legislation. No more delays and no more excuses. The American taxpayer deserves better. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about S. 1186--the Workforce Investment Partnership Act and to applaud the Labor and Human Resources Committee for the bipartisan manner in which the legislation was developed. 
In the last Congress the opportunity for reform of employment and training programs was lost due to partisan bickering and the insistence on a reform structure which I believe jeopardized the investment in skills training--and in particular the investment in the retraining of dislocated workers. 
This bill builds on the success of the dislocated worker program and adds other elements which will improve the program. These include establishing One-Stop centers as the framework of the new workforce development system which will improve dislocated worker access to quality information and services, and the proposed skill grants--or Individual Training Account system--which will enable them to make informed choices about training opportunities with qualified vendors. 
Despite our improving economy, there are always workers who will lose jobs because of economic change. We owe these workers the tools to get back on their feet, through rapid response to plant closings and mass layoffs, job search assistance and retraining for new jobs. I am particularly pleased that this bill includes rapid response and labor-management committees which have been important tools under the current dislocated worker program. This program, where formula grants to states and localities are supplemented by National Reserve Account to allow the Secretary of Labor to respond to emergencies, has been successful in helping hundreds of thousands of workers each year to make mid-career changes. 
The current dislocated worker program served approximately 540,000 dislocated workers nationwide in the most recent year. Of those who completed the program during that year, 71 percent were employed when they left the program, earning on average 93 percent of their previous wages, and for workers who had received retraining, the wage replacement was 95 percent. 
The Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor conducted an audit of JTPA Title III retraining services to determine how successful retraining was in helping dislocated workers to return to work. The conclusion of the April 1995 report was: `The purpose of Title III is to return dislocated workers to productive employment. In this context, the program was successful. Program participants were reemployed, remained in the workforce, and regained their prior earning power.' 
In my own state of Washington, we have experienced layoffs in the timber and aerospace industries and the assistance provided by Title III of JTPA has been essential to meeting the needs of affected workers. 
The success of the program is illustrated by the experience of one dislocated worker, Mr. David Hamilton of Valley, Washington. He had a steady income working in the logging industry, but only for six to eight months each year. This created a difficult financial situation when employment was not available. In July 1995, he was laid off from Accord Logging. 
He decided to investigate career options in the cross-country truck driving field. He learned of the opportunities available through JTPA and began actively seeking financial assistance for training. With only a tenth grade education, his employment opportunities were limited. He knew that he needed a GED, but his assessment test also indicated a deficiency in basic math skills. With his unemployment benefits nearly exhausted, he held steadfastly to his hope of entering the truck driving industry. He pursued his education and training through the Colville Job Service JTPA Title III program. His determination to obtain a Commercial Drivers License increased as he passed his physical and Wonderlic tests (in lieu of a GED). He met the program qualifications for Title III funding and completed his training on February 23, 1997, with excellent grades. He was immediately placed with G & G Trucking and was driving cross-country the following Monday. G & G agreed to assist him with the financing needed to purchase a tractor. Within six months he became an owner-operator. As an owner-operator, he will earn between $12 and $18 per hour. He now has a reliable source of income and greater financial security. 
The success of Mr. Hamilton and other dislocated worker program participants is why I am so pleased that S. 1186 is designed to assure that funding for dislocated workers will be maintained. This is an important improvement over last year's bill and I thank the authors of S. 1186 for their attention to this critical item.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO. 
I believe in a United States that is an activist leader and respectful participant in world affairs. This leadership comes with responsibilities that are often difficult for the United States: troops stationed and foreign aid dollars expended abroad; cooperation with international organizations like the United Nations; and the decision on NATO expansion that is before the Senate today. U.S. leadership abroad remains a vital national interest to the American people. My record as a United States Senator is strongly in support of a United States fully engaged with the world, a country and a people that participate and lead the international efforts to address the many problems that transcend borders and cultures. 
NATO, since its founding in 1949, has been a successful foundation of U.S. security and cooperation with our European allies. This was particularly true throughout the period of the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union and communism can be partially credited to NATO; both to the alliance's collective defense arrangements and to its complimentary role in bringing Europe together which has fostered democratic and economic ties among countries with historical and cultural grievances. NATO has played a significant role in creating a Europe free from serious conflict for nearly 50 years. 
The Senate is now considering whether to enlarge the sixteen member alliance by admitting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Few will deny that these three countries are prepared and committed to assuming the responsibilities of NATO membership. Few will contest the statement that these three countries have long ties to the West; that these three countries are the most Western states of the former Soviet bloc. And few will assert that these three countries face any military threat from Russia or other foe, either today or in the foreseeable future. I am confident that the enormous changes that have taken place in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will not be jeopardized by the upcoming vote. These changes including the creation of democratic institutions, new respect for human rights, and a growing market economy all enjoy enormous public support and will be continued regardless of Senate's decision on NATO expansion. 
I do have a number of very serious concerns about NATO expansion including several which have been addressed through the amendment process. My concerns have very little to do with the three candidates for NATO expansion. In fact, I believe the United States and our allies should take aggressive steps to support these burgeoning democracies which have demonstrated so much promise since the fall of the Soviet Union. Each of these countries has a remarkable story to tell and each is deserving of closer ties to the United States and the West. 
I voted for the amendment offered by Senator Harkin to call for an accurate accounting of all expenses to the United States related to NATO expansion. The Senate and the American people ought to better understand the obligations we are assuming if we agree to NATO expansion. I have no confidence in the various cost estimates that have been presented during this entire process. In fact, I am fairly certain the costs to U.S. taxpayers will exceed even the Administration's highest estimates. The various cost estimates for NATO expansion have ranged from $1.5 billion to $125 billion. 
Opponents of the Harkin amendment argue that the U.S. is not issuing a blank check on behalf of our taxpayers. Certainly, Congress will object to escalating costs for NATO in the future and particularly if a significantly larger NATO burden falls upon the United States. However, my concern is that without a full accounting of costs, the United States is assuming a new moral and financial obligation to NATO without adequate consideration by the Senate. U.S. prestige and our position in the world should not be risked at some future point because we did not know or were not prepared to consider today the full costs on NATO expansion. 
The Moynihan amendment to link NATO expansion with admission to the European Union also addresses my concerns regarding the most appropriate forum for integration between the West and the many former Soviet satellite states seeking closer ties with Western Europe and the United States. Senator Moynihan has been an articulate voice throughout this debate and I do agree with many of the eloquent points he has brought before the Senate. I voted for the Moynihan amendment as I believe European Union membership is the most appropriate of the available forums for integrating with the West the three nations invited to join NATO. 
These three countries are in various stages of economic development and each is committed to improving the lives of its citizens through closer ties to the West. In my mind, the European Union is a far better vehicle for economic growth and integration with the West. Participation and inclusion in the EU and its marketplace will pay dividends for the people of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary that far outweigh the security assurances inherent with NATO membership. 
The European Union has begun negotiations for EU admission with Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary and several other countries. Frankly, I am very skeptical that the EU will in a timely manner admit new members. The EU has a history of protected industries--particularly agriculture--and I doubt Europe's protected industries will be anxious to take on lower wage countries or significant agricultural producers. Export states here at home, like my state of Washington, have long sought to open Europe's protected market and system of state subsidies. We should be careful not to aid or validate Europe's trade practices which have hurt the United States. 
Admission to the EU is a question for EU countries to consider, however, I do not think we should give the EU the opportunity to settle for NATO expansion. Europe has the strongest interest in the success of many former Soviet states. The EU, including the European states who do not belong to NATO, should also be expected to make sacrifices to ensure a peace for all time in Europe. 
My vote for the Moynihan amendment should be viewed as a call for new thinking on the shared objective of bringing the newly independent nations of Europe into the existing political and economic system. We have to ask ourselves if the tools of the Cold War will work for the U.S. and Europe as we enter a new century. 
The impact of NATO expansion on our relationship with Russia is my most significant concern on this issue. I am delighted so many of my colleagues have raised the issue, both those who favor expansion and those who oppose it. 
Unfortunately, I believe that the impact of the vote we are to cast today will have very little effect on the U.S.-Russia relationship. For I believe, from the very beginning of the expansion process, we have pursued a process and a policy that has seriously damaged our relationship with Russia. I believe the Administration has erred greatly here and our foreign policy will be effected by it for years to come regardless of the outcome of the NATO expansion vote. 
Already, numerous Senators have cited the historic work of George Kennan. I also take his counsel very seriously and I encourage my colleagues to ponder his words from a 1997 New York Times opinion piece. Mr. Kennan wrote, `Expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era. Such a decision may be expected to inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.' 
Kennan's final words are particularly troubling as he states, `. . . to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking.' One needs only look at recent weapons inspection crisis with Iraq to see the worsening ties between the U.S. and Russia as a result of NATO expansion. There are other examples of the growing divide between the U.S. and Russia: cooperation with Iran on ballistic missiles, agreements with China to counter a world with one superpower, and an assortment of other nuclear weapons related issues from declarations on the first use of nuclear weapons to ratification of START III and the eventual negotiation of START. All of these issues are vital to the United States and all have been negatively impacted by NATO expansion. 
It goes without saying that Russia does not dictate to the United States our foreign policy interests and policies. However, U.S. policy makers should not underestimate the degree to which Russia matters to our own future. Russia is the largest nation in a new Europe. Any attempt to guarantee the future peace and security of Europe by excluding Russia creates more problems than promise for the future.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, here we go again. As we have done so many times in recent years, we are sacrificing serious and legitimate national interests to the partisan and divisive abortion debate. Due to the global gag rule imposed on international family planning, I will vote against the conference report on H.R. 1757, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. 
I commend the President for his strong veto message to the Congress on this legislation. Passage of this conference report will not change current law. A vote in favor of the conference report will not ultimately result in the payment of the U.S. debt to the United Nations or the reorganization of the State Department. Passage may score political points but it will delay this important legislation and diminish U.S. standing in the international community. 
This language is anything but a compromise as proponents of the new global gag rule claim in defending the conference report. It was not adopted nor debated on the Senate floor. Every single Democratic conferee to this legislation refused to sign the conference report. Labeling this language a compromise is misleading and untrue. 
Passage of the conference report will unfairly disqualify many family planning organizations from receiving U.S. international family planning funds if they use their own funds in their own countries to point out the adverse public health consequences of medically unsafe abortion. The elimination of these non-governmental organizations from the program, considered to be one of the best and most cost-effective channels for U.S. foreign aid dollars, will have a devastating impact on this critical foreign aid program. 
The language in the bill will condition an organization's eligibility for U.S. family planning assistance unless it agrees to surrender its rights to free speech and participation in the political process in its own country using its own funds. Proponents of the controversial language will describe it as a ban on abortion lobbying, such as a restriction would be unconstitutional if applied to American citizens and would undermine one of the primary objectives of our foreign policy--the promotion of democracy around the world. The Senate should reject this conference report and the restrictive family planning language added behind closed doors. 
Enactment of the conference report will result in the reduction of family planning funding by $44 million. The funding cut would likely cause a subsequent increase in the number of abortions as couples lose or are denied access to contraceptive services. Any Senator who supports family planning as a means to reduce the incidence of abortion should oppose this bill. 
Family planning saves lives, particularly in the developing world where a woman dies in pregnancy or childbirth every minute of every day and where more than 12 million children each year do not live to see their fifth birthday. 
I urge the Senate to reject the Conference Report on the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have been debating education policy for several days and actually several times over the last several months here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am very excited about that, because one of the reasons I came here to the U.S. Senate was to make sure that we focus on real issues that affect everyday average families across our country. There is nothing more important to any parents than making sure, when they send their children off to school in the morning, that they get the kind of education that will mean they will be a success in this country. 
I am disappointed, however, that the bill before us, the Coverdell IRA proposal, will not provide that kind of quality education that parents are demanding. I believe it is a flawed policy which really will not make any meaningful difference for either private or public school students and their families. It is not a real results-driven proposal. 
Many of my colleagues have been out here on the floor over the last several days talking about what the IRA Coverdell proposal will do and that it will only mean $7 for a family in the future. Many of my colleagues have talked about how it will begin us on a road to publicly funding private schools, and the dangers of that. 
We can debate that. But I am here today to bring forward an amendment that I believe will make a substantial difference in our children's education across the country, and that is regarding the issue of class size. Ask any parent who sends his or her child off to school what question they ask when their child comes home on the first day of school. It is, `How many kids are in your class?' They ask that because they know it will make a difference in whether or not their child gets the attention and the education he or she needs throughout that entire school year. If there are 40 kids in the classroom, or 35 kids in the classroom, your child will not get the kind of education and attention that he or she needs and deserves in this complex world that we live in today. 
My amendment that is before the Senate is a sense of the Congress that we should support efforts to hire 100,000 new teachers so that we can reduce class sizes in first, second and third grades to an average of 18 students per class all across America. 
This is simply a sense of the Congress saying this is the way we should move forward. We have been on the floor before to debate this issue, and this Congress has said no, they are not going to fund lower class sizes. I am back today because I believe this is the kind of difference that we can make, that we should make, and that we must make. Reducing class sizes will make a difference for children across the country. 
Will 100,000 teachers be enough? No, but it will be an impetus. This amendment simply will send a message that we understand the issue and we are willing to take it under consideration and move it forward. 
I know as a former educator what a difference it makes to have a smaller class size. I have taught 4-year-olds. I have had 18 children in my classroom. I have had 24 children in my classroom. It means the difference between having the time to work individually with students or simply having crowd control for the entire classroom. 
Every teacher of early grades will tell you the more time they have with their students, the better chance they have to make sure that all students will have the chance to learn to read, to learn to write, to learn the basic skills that will mean that they are a success throughout their later years. It also means that those teachers will have the time to deal with the complex problems that come before them as a teacher in our classrooms. 
I distinctly remember one time I had with a class when I had a young student come to class and we were in the process of talking about the alphabet. We were talking about one of the letters. I was talking with my young children about different words that begin with the letter A, and all of a sudden a young child in my classroom just simply blurted out to me, `My dad didn't come home last night; he was arrested.' My entire class stopped. How could I have talked about the alphabet? How could I have talked about the words that started with the letter A? 
I had a devastated child in my classroom of 24. Yet, I could not take the time to sit with him and work with him because I had 23 other children in my classroom who needed attention and whose parents wanted them to learn about the alphabet. 
That child probably went on to a very troubled adulthood. We could have made a difference simply by having fewer students in the classroom, by simply having the time to deal with these kind of problems. Don't just take it from me as a former educator, take it from the studies. 
I have submitted a number of studies in the past as I have talked about this issue on this floor. A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR Program which compared the performance of students in grades K through 3 in small and regular size classes found that students in small classes of 13 to 17 students significantly outperformed other students in math and reading every year at all grade levels across all geographic areas. 
My sense of the Congress simply says we understand this is significant. It says we in the Senate want to make a difference in the learning of American children, and we want to move forward on the progress of reducing class size and take that on as an issue in this country.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Al Bauer is a former colleague of mine in the State Senate of Washington. He is also a former educator, and he speaks from his heart when he talks about education. He wrote in his letter that hiring more well-trained teachers will help school districts stave off cuts to other special programs for at-risk students. He argues that more teachers does not have to mean more classrooms. It is the number of well-trained adults in the room that is important, because students' access to time with the teacher is at the heart of learning. He argues that Congress can pay for class-size reductions if we can put billions of extra dollars into transportation. 
State Senator Al Bauer is absolutely right. The arguments against this proposal are not valid. It doesn't mean that we need more class space. It doesn't mean that we will siphon money from other places. 
It does mean that this Congress, this Senate, the people on this floor are listening to what parents and educators and people across this country are saying. When we send our children off to school, we want to know they are safe, we want to know they will learn, and we know they will be safe and they will learn and get the attention they need if we begin to focus on class size in this country. 
Now, a person could spend a year or a lifetime searching, and they would not be able to find someone who understands education in Washington state more deeply than Senator Al Bauer. And he happens to be a former educator, and he happens to be a Democrat. But Senator Bauer and I stood together in the state Senate, and we worked with our Republican colleagues to do everything we could to improve public education. 
He knows and I know that Republicans and Democrats in Washington state can work together. They have worked together to reduce class size, increase family involvement in school decisions, fund school construction, improve teacher quality, allow communities to set higher standards for students, publish school report cards, hold schools accountable for results, reward schools that do well and mediate schools that are failing, increase student's options about which school they attend. 
All these things were bipartisan proposals, based on what local school communities told us would work to improve results for students. And the great news is that many of these proposals have actually improved things in Washington state schools. 
And when I think about the partisan tone of this debate on education, and I look at the education IRA proposal which offers only a seven-dollar a year solution to only a few families--I think of all the things we could be doing that would really make a difference for all students. And class size improvement is near the top of that list. 
I think it is important to listen to what educators say. I want to read to you what some of the educators have written to me as I have talked about this issue over the last several months. 
Larry Swift, who is the executive director of the Washington State School Directors' Association, wrote to me, and I especially appreciate his words because I am a former school board member and Larry Swift represents the school board members across my State. He says: 
As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for all of our students, it becomes increasingly important that all of our resources be used efficiently and effectively. The most valuable resource in today's schools is the people who devote their time and effort to make schools successful--the teachers. Reducing the ratio of students to adults is particularly critical for youngsters with a variety of learning challenges that must be overcome if those students are to meet the new, higher learning standards. 
Mr. President, Larry Swift is right. Representing the school boards across my country, he makes a very clear case that increasing the number of teachers and reducing the class size is critical because we are requiring our young students to know more today than we ever have before in the history of this country. 
Let me also quote from Kenneth Winkes, who is the head of the Association of Washington State Principals. He represents all the principals in my State, and here is what they say: 
It is increasingly evident that students entering our schools have diverse and unique needs which can only be addressed by principals, teachers, and support personnel who are not overwhelmed by crowded classrooms. Rather, educators must be able to devote attention to each student in smaller, more manageable classes. 
That is what principals say.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr, President, I have numerous quotes from teachers, and I can tell you from personal anecdotes, as I have talked with teachers throughout my State, it makes a difference when you have time, it makes a difference when you have to turn away three or four students with a question because you simply don't have time. We demand higher learning skills. We have a responsibility to do something about it. We can't just say, `Oh, it's a local school district problem.' `Oh, it's a State problem.' `Oh, it's somebody else's problem.' 
We have a responsibility in the U.S. Senate as leaders in this country to send a message that we want to make a difference and we are listening to the people we represent that class size makes a difference. 
Let me also tell you what some students say, because I have a group of students who are my advisors. They are called my student advisory youth involvement team or SAYIT. I go to them and ask them to tell me what they think of the issues we are debating. 
On the issue of class size, this is what students say: 
Brook Bodnar, who is age 16, recently moved from a school with larger classes to Olympia High School which has smaller classes. She says: 
. . . with smaller classes I'm learning so much more. Class is going so much faster. 
That is what a student says. 
Jared Stueckle, age 16, a junior at Selah High School, believes education should be a higher priority in funding and that class size is a good investment. Jared says: 
The classes in which the number (of students) is lower I generally do better, but in a crowded class, the teacher does not give us enough individual attention.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if we listen to parents, if we listen to teachers, if we listen to principals, if we listen to school board members, and if we listen to our children, we will hear what the American public truly wants and knows is right. Parents say it, teachers say it, studies prove it: Smaller class sizes will make a difference in our children's ability to learn. 
My amendment simply says that it is the sense of the Congress that we will move forward in any way we can to make sure that class sizes in this country are reduced to manageable levels. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I listened with interest to my colleague from the other side of the aisle debate the issue of whether or not we as parents across this country believe that our class sizes should be reduced and that it will make a difference. I heard numbers that don't take into account what is really happening, because that is the number of adults in a school that my colleague from Arkansas referred to--the nurses, the counselors, librarians, social workers. What we are talking about here is the need to put new teachers across this country into classrooms so we can reduce class size. 
I speak to all of the people who are listening to this debate today. When you hear somebody say your class sizes are the right size, think about how many kids are in the classroom in your local school; think of the amount of attention they are getting; think about whether or not they are getting the skills that you as a parent want them to get. If you agree with me that class size reduction will make a difference, call this Senate and let us know. Call this Senate and let us know. People across this country need to let us know that you recognize it is our responsibility as adults at every level to make sure that our children are getting a good education. Parents know it, teachers know it, and studies show it: Class size reduction makes a difference. We can't pass this off and say it is somebody else's responsibility; it is our responsibility. 
I heard my colleague say there is a philosophical difference. You bet there is a philosophical difference. There is a philosophical difference between those who believe we should go down a path of block grants and cuts, meaning high-need students will get less. There is a proposal that we eliminate the Department of Education and no longer even say public education is in the domain of this country or that we care about it as a priority. 
This current budget that was passed by the Republicans just a short time ago cut education by $2.2 billion. The IRA proposal in front of us that takes us down a road where somebody gets $7 in the year 2002 for education, it is a narrow road that says in the future only a few children will get a good education. 
The philosophy I believe is that every child, no matter who they are, where they come from, or how much money they have in these United States of America, will be able to get a good public education. We can do that by reducing class size, by rebuilding our crumbling schools, by making an investment in our teachers and training them with the skills they need to teach our children. That is the philosophy that will make sure we have a strong democracy in the future. 
I hope that parents across this country weigh in on this debate. It is a critical one for the future of all of us.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have had a brief chance to take a look at this amendment. We have not seen it before 10 minutes ago. We are looking at the language now. 
The Senator from Arkansas says that he wants 95 percent of the money to go to classrooms. I don't think anybody disagrees with that. In fact, it is my understanding that much more than that--in fact, 98 percent of Federal funds actually go to school districts and classrooms. So what he is asking for currently is in place. 
We go back to why I originally put this amendment before us, which is the fact that we have classrooms that are overcrowded, classrooms where children are not learning. We have classrooms where we as elected officials are demanding that our students learn math, reading, and language skills but simply do not have the ability to do it because of overcrowded classrooms. 
Mr. President, we will continue to take a look at this language. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts for a comment.

Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues from Massachusetts and North Dakota because they are stating the case quite correctly on class size. It absolutely makes a difference when you reduce class size particularly in lower grades. 
The Senator from Massachusetts has cited what several empirical studies have shown. The Educational Testing Service says that empirical evidence is clear; smaller classes can make higher levels of student achievement, at least in the elementary school grades and particularly for disadvantaged students. 
We have submitted these studies for the Record, and our colleagues are welcome to look at the Record. But I can tell you as an educator, clearly class size makes a difference. There is not a parent in this country who does not want to send their child off to school and know that they are learning how to read, that they are learning how to write, that they are learning math skills. When you have reduced class size, it makes a difference. Ask any parent. Ask any student. Ask any teacher. It will make a difference. 
Every parent asks their child on the first day of school when they come home, `Who is your teacher? How many kids in your classroom?' They ask that because they know it makes a difference. Parents know it. Students know it. Teachers know it. And the studies show it. If you want to help IDEA kids, to which many of my colleagues have been alluding on the floor, I will tell you that class size matters. It matters more than anything else. I think it is absolutely imperative that this Senate go on record stating that we understand that. We are not going to ignore it. We are not going to come up with all kinds of arguments about paperwork and bureaucracy and federalism. We are going to say that as leaders in this country we understand that class size makes a difference. We want to make a difference for our children in our schools across this country, and we can by passing this amendment.

Mrs. MURRAY. In the President's State of the Union Address, he said he wanted us, in our budget, to add 100,000 additional teachers in our classrooms just as we added 100,000 police officers. Within our budget, we will look at how we can do that. My sense of the Senate simply puts us on record, as leaders in this country, that we are going to move in this direction. We have numerous ways of looking at it. 
If we can fund roads, if we can fund construction projects across this country, if we can fund numerous projects that we have in our budgets, we certainly can fund lower class sizes for our students across this country that will make a difference.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the education debate because I care deeply about public education in this country. I believe that our democracy was founded on the principle that all children, no matter who they are or where they come from or how much money they have, should have the opportunity within our public education system in this country to get a good education. I have gone across my State and asked parents and teachers and principals and school board members, What will make a difference? And resoundingly they have said to me we need to focus attention on class size; the Senate needs to focus their attention on class size. 
I am, frankly, really tired of the argument that our public education system has failed. Our public education system has not failed. We have failed our public education system. And we have failed it because we have not put in the adequate resources for what we are demanding, as leaders in this country--that our children learn how to read and write and get the skills they need to get jobs one day. These are skills we are demanding. Yet we turn our backs and say we are not going to fund it. 
This is an issue of priorities. Are we going to fund public education in this country? Or are we going to do what my Republican colleagues did in this budget and cut $2.2 billion from education? Mr. President, we can go down a narrow road in this country, and we can pass vouchers, and we can say that we can block grant, and we can make sure that a few kids get a public education. But that is not the country I was born and raised in. That is not the philosophy I believe in. I believe we can do the right thing. I know, and I will tell all of you: Reducing class size makes a difference. Ask any parent. Ask any parent if they know that it makes a difference, and they will tell you yes, it does. 
Mr. President, this is a simple amendment that we are offering. It simply says this Congress understands that class size reduction is an issue that makes a difference and we are willing to look at how we can help make that happen across this country. I urge its adoption.

Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. 
The amendment before us is very simple. It merely asks us to go on record as to whether or not we Members of the Senate believe we should support efforts to decrease class size in the early grades. 
As a parent of a child in public education, two children who have gone through our public schools, as a former school board member, as a member of the PTA, as a former educator myself who has been in the classroom, who knows the difference between having 18 young 4-year-olds or 24 4-year-olds, who knows the difference between teaching and crowd control, I will tell the Members of this Senate that decreasing class size is one of the most important things we can do to increase the education for our young children. 
Every Member here has talked about the need for increased math skills, the need for our young children to be able to read and write and have the skills they need. If we decrease class size, every parent in this country will tell you that it will make a difference. Studies show it. Parents know it. Teachers know it. It is time for this Senate to recognize that and move, on our part, with our responsibility, to decrease class size. I urge the adoption of this amendment.

<TEXT>
Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, my amendment increases Function 500 budget authority and outlays to include the President's education initiatives, and adds the Resolution level for IDEA. The offset is a Function 920 across-the-board reduction of less than one percent, taken from non-defense discretionary funds. 
The President's budget request only included a level of $35 million for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (I.D.E.A). To get the Federal Government back on track toward its responsibility to cover 40 percent of the cost of educating special education students at the local level, significant increases are necessary. 
The Resolution level in fiscal year 99 for Function 500 is $500 million below a freeze. It does not provide enough funding for the important education initiatives requested by the President and supported by the American public: Continuing investments in education technology, including teacher training reflecting my Teacher Technology Training Act; creation of education empowerment zones; appropriations for Minority Teacher Recruitment; funding for the 21st Century Learning Centers; appropriations for Children's Literacy and Work Study; increases for Title I funding; an increase in the maximum Pell Grant; and increased funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools. 
My amendment makes education a higher priority within the construct of a balanced budget. I must point out that even with my amendment, the President and the Budget Committee have left other critical educational services unfunded. But by passing this amendment, we will take steps to stop the cuts to education, and get on the road toward results for American students. 
Mr. President, the American people believe education should be a higher priority than its current 1.8 percent of total Federal outlays. They see the need to improve the quality of every Federal education program, minimize red tape, improve efficiency, and create collaboration. But, they also see our Nation facing increased enrollments, a teacher corps nearing retirement, and other factors which increase the overall need for education funding at this critical point in our history. The American people see that education must become a higher priority in our national budget. 
Unfortunately, this budget fails to meet the education needs of America. It does not invest in the future. It cuts from services that are helping students in schools today. This budget resolution places America at a crossroads--and it takes us down the wrong road. A vote for the Murray amendment is a vote that honors our commitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education funding, but doesn't try to pit students against one another over limited federal dollars. We need to invest in the future, and we need a budget that reflects America's priorities. 
Mr. President, when looking at the budget resolution as it came from the Committee, I think we need to ask `what do the assumptions in the Republican budget resolution leave out?' The answers are disturbing. 
Within Function 500, for sub-function 501 (Elementary and Secondary Education), Chairman Domenici's Committee resolution starts with a freeze. 
The resolution then adds $2.5 billion for funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (IDEA), and $6.3 billion for Title VI School Reform efforts, for a total of $8.8 billion over 5 years. 
From this amount, the majority then assumes that $2.2 billion will be saved through consolidation of current educational services, leaving their overall add to a freeze at $6.6 billion. 
Mr. President, another important question now arises: Which important priorities of the American people were left out when the majority ignored the President's new initiatives? 
The only education programs explicitly left unfunded by the discretionary Republican budget resolution are the President's new initiatives (such as educational empowerment zones; teacher technology training; the new transition to school program; community-based technology centers; and Safe and Drug-Free Schools coordinators). These programs total $2.4 billion. 
When added to the $7.3 billion in mandatory spending for class size reduction, the total President's request level for new sub-function 501 funds is $9.7 billion over a freeze. 
Because the Republicans assume $2.2 billion in consolidation, we need to ask another question: Which current programs will be cut under their $2.2 billion consolidation proposal? 
This list could include any discretionary elementary and secondary education program, such as: 
Title I Education for the Disadvantaged (including reading and math assistance for needy students; Even Start; Migrant Education; services for neglected and delinquent students; and others.) 
America Reads Children's Literacy 
Eisenhower Professional Development 
Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities 
Magnet Schools 
Education for Homeless Children and Youth 
Inexpensive Book Distribution 
Bilingual Education 
Goals 2000 
Arts in Education 
Women's Educational Equity 
School-to-Work 
Vocational Education 
The American people will remember that last year, during debates on consolidation and block granting, proponents of block-granting federal education funds proclaimed that by eliminating bureaucracy under block-granting, school districts would actually have more money to spend, not less. Hold-harmless provisions were discussed, which would purportedly assure that school districts would not see funding cuts. 
But we had all heard this kind of talk before, from those who start by `consolidating,' and then take the next step to `downsizing.' Too often a block-grant equals a cut, and our school communities know it. 
We were told that the fundamental philosophical question was whether or not we believed that individual school districts and parents and teachers know best how to handle education in their own communities, or whether we believed those fundamental decisions are best left to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. 
I think the fundamental question is rather when certain people in positions of authority in Washington D.C. are going to listen to their state and local governments and the people. This is a time of incredible renewal in education. Republicans, Democrats and Independents in my state of Washington and other states are on a serious, measurable road to school improvement. 
From school report cards, to higher standards, to increased family and community involvement--improvement is happening, accountability is present, and students and their parents are seeing results. At a minimum, there is a fundamental discussion about educational improvement going on in every community in my state. When federal consolidation is tied to questions of `who knows best,' I think those who do know best, the parents, teachers, students, and community leaders like those in my state have reason to feel betrayed. 
Because money does matter. Yes, we need to consolidate services where it has an educational goal. Yes, the federal government works best when it creates red tape least--but Americans interested in improving education already have venues to make these changes. And these discussions--such as the one that will occur during the 1999 rewrite of federal elementary and secondary education programs--respect the knowledge and experience of those who actually learn with or work with federal education services. 
But when the Congress ignores needed investments to improve school facilities and improve the quality of school personnel--then uses block-grants as cover for education cuts--local communities have reason to feel betrayed. 
So, my hope is that those who want to improve the federal government's efforts to help students learn, and who see consolidation as a vehicle toward this end, will work with local school communities. My hope is that they will work with those of us who have experience in education. My hope is that we can work together to find results for students. 
Because when the Congressional majority begins to pay attention to the appropriate federal role in school improvement, that is a positive step. Now that the discussion is joined, however, it must be productive, bipartisan, and aimed at efforts that will work. 
When we look at this budget resolution, we also need to ask `what do the assumptions in the President's budget request leave out?' 
The President's budget request assumes less than sufficient funding (less than current-services funding, or complete terminations) for, among others: 
Impact Aid (Construction and payments for Federal Property) 
State Student Incentive Grant 
Innovative Education Program Strategies 
Ellender Fellowships 
Literacy Programs for Prisoners 
Urban Community Service 
National Early Intervention Scholarships and Partnerships 
State Grants for Incarcerated Youth Offenders 
In addition, the President's budget includes only $35 million for funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act over a freeze annually. My amendment would meet the $500 million increase per year in Sen. Domenici's Committee reported resolution ($465 million over the President's level). For too long, the Congress has not met its obligation to pay 40 percent of the costs of educating each special education student. 
Education, especially public education, is near and dear to the American people. Although the challenges are great, there are productive discussions happening in public schools across the country. Local people are making decisions that are producing results for students. We know we need to expect more from our schools than folks did in the past. We know we have an economy and a society full of new demands. Regardless of political persuasion, ethnicity, income, age, or any other dividing line one might find--all Americans want students to succeed. And there is broad recognition that we should do more, not less. More to improve the quality of our schools. And more to make education a higher priority in the federal budget. I urge adoption of the Murray amendment.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of amendment No. 2268 to S. Con. Res. 86 introduced by Senator kempthorne, expressing the Sense of the Senate that funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) should be fully maintained as authorized and aggressively utilized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage U.S. agricultural exports, strengthen farm income, counter subsidized foreign competition, and protect American jobs. 
The MAP is an important trade promoting program that truly benefits the diverse agriculture of Washington state and the nation. The MAP is a partnership with private agriculture to promote U.S. agricultural goods around the world. It helps to level the playing field for our growers in a global marketplace made increasingly competitive by subsidies foreign governments provide to their growers. 
This Sense of the Senate resolution corrects the misguided direction of the Budget Committee to cut the MAP. This proposed cut was one among many reasons that I voted against this Budget Resolution when it was passed out of the Budget Committee. 
Since moving towards market-based agricultural programs under the 1996 FAIR Act, research and trade have become the new safety net for our growers. Without continuous and vigorous trade promotion, our growers will see market share decline and farmgate prices drop. Our growers are already suffering under depressed prices, they need us to maintain the MAP and other agricultural trade initiatives to remain competitive. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am proud to be on the floor today as we discuss a budget that is balanced and does have a planned surplus for as far as the eye can see. It was only a few short years ago when we were here on the floor debating budgets that anticipated deficits well into the future. While I support the fiscal responsibility assumed in this budget, I have to rise in opposition. This budget does little to prepare for the next century and it allows the federal government to turn its back on our children. This budget is a failure for our children and our economic future. 
During Committee consideration and floor debate, I attempted to amend this Resolution in an effort to ensure that children remain a top priority of the federal budget. Unfortunately, the Republicans chose to ignore the education and early development needs of our children. The Republican budget strategy is to spend for today and do little to plan for tomorrow. 
As a new Member of the Senate Budget Committee in 1993, I was committed to reducing the deficits and restoring fiscal order to federal spending. I knew that it would be a tough challenge and a difficult task, but I also knew we owed our children this much. We had to end deficit spending and stop borrowing from their future. 
I stood on this floor during the summer of 1993 when we debated the Deficit Reduction plan, which many of my Colleagues on the other side predicted would drive our economy into recession and do little to reduce the deficit. As we debate the fiscal year 1999 Budget Resolution, I am pleased to report that the discussion has gone from how to reduce the deficit to how to invest the surplus. The economy is strong and all indications show that economic growth will continue. Unemployment is at an all time low and interest rates are not raging out of control. 
I am proud to have worked to get our fiscal house in order without jeopardizing our economic prosperity. I also welcome the new challenges of how to invest the surplus and maintain our investments in our future. 
I am pleased that the Republican budget does do the right thing on Social Security. As called for by the President, the Resolution currently before us today does dedicate any budget surplus to saving Social Security. This is the kind of bipartisan work that I am pleased to be part of. Saving Social Security is important for current workers and future retirees. 
Social Security is the most important anti-poverty program ever implemented by the federal government. As a result of the enactment of Social Security, far fewer seniors live in poverty when they retire. For many, having Social Security gave them the ability to retire. 
Without Social Security, old age would mean economic insecurity and instability. The program has been an unqualified success and we must continue this proud legacy. 
We have made a commitment to today's workers that must be honored. When they retire or become disabled, Social Security will protect them and their families from economic disaster. We must do everything possible to maintain the success of Social Security. 
But I am concerned that there are some who want to use the surplus to provide tax shelters to the most affluent. Make no mistake about it, simply allowing tax cuts to encourage workers to set up individual retirement accounts will not have Social Security. It will give those with more income a greater ability to shelter this income, but it does little to help Social Security. Keep in mind, Social Security is a social insurance plan, not a retirement plan. Insurance works best when the risk is spread across the population. Allowing the rich to shelter more of their income to save for retirement will not save Social Security. 
Please do not hide behind saving Social Security to provide tax cuts to the most affluent. The American worker deserves a more honest and responsible approach. We can reform Social Security without dismantling the program. We need to work in a bipartisan manner to enact real reforms, not tax cuts in disguise. 
I also urge my Colleagues on the other side not to fool themselves into thinking that dedicated all federal tobacco revenues to Medicare will save the program. Medicare's problems go well beyond just a cash reserve. Unlike Social Security, Medicare has always been a pay-as-you-go program. Simply throwing money at the program will do little to improve the long term condition of the Medicare program. We all know that structural changes are the real answer. We have to improve the health of senior citizens before we can hope to improve the financial health of Medicare. 
I am pleased that my amendment regarding prevention benefits for Medicare beneficiaries was adopted by the Senate. If my Colleagues on the other side are serious about saving Medicare, we must increase the prevention focus within Medicare. It is simply beyond understanding why Medicare will not reimburse for prescription drugs to reduce cholesterol, but will pay for inpatient, acute care for by-pass surgery. 
A greater focus on prevention will prove that we are serious about saving Medicare. Prevention benefits are the kind of reforms needed to really save Medicare. It seems almost insincere to target new federal tobacco revenues to Medicare and not put these benefits to use in improving the health status of senior citizens. 
I think the greatest failure of this budget is the complete disregard for enacting real tobacco control legislation. The debate is not just about how to spend tobacco revenues, but enacting a national anti-smoking bill that could potentially wipe out smoking in less than one generation. We have an historic opportunity to end the plague of tobacco. We cannot afford to let this opportunity pass. 
The Republican budget resolution creates huge roadblocks for enacting tobacco control legislation. I am concerned that the Resolution will block any new revenues for the Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine as a drug. Without new revenues, FDA cannot enforce youth access laws that prevent children from buying cigarettes. Without tobacco revenues, FDA cannot regulate an industry known for hiding the facts and lying to Congress. How can FDA challenge an industry that has creatively targeted our children? 
There can be no anti-smoking national policy without a strong and well-financed FDA. Any attempt to pass anti tobacco legislation without a strong FDA will only fail. We will never end the tobacco companies attack on our children. 
This Budget Resolution fails our children in many ways. Not just about tobacco, but in preparing them for the challenges they will face tomorrow. We have all seen study after study that proves we need to place education as a top priority at both the federal and state level. Our children do not have the resources and are not being given the opportunity to meet their potential. 
I am disappointed in the lack of any effort in the Republican Budget Resolution to deal with overcrowded classrooms and decaying schools. How can we hope for high test scores when children have no heat in the classroom or windows covered with cardboard? How can we hope to prepare our children when there are 45 children in each classroom? How does a child receive the individual attention so important to cultivating their skills and their self esteem when there are 45 students for every teacher? Our classrooms boarder on chaos every day because of these deplorable conditions. Yet the Republican response was to simply ignore these problems. 
These are not local problems as some may argue. A well educated and skilled work force is a national security issue. We cannot remain a global economic power without a well educated and skilled work force. If we do not dedicate the resources necessary to ensure that every child can learn and can learn in an environment that is geared toward more than just survival, we jeopardize our own economic stability. Education is not just a local concern or a concern of parents. Ask any business owner about the need to have an adequate supply of skilled labor. I can assure you that this is not a local issue, but is becoming a national disgrace. 
Ignoring investments in education is simply irresponsible and selfish. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and address the pressing needs of today's classrooms. We can do better.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I rise in strong support of this amendment and offer my congratulations to the Senator from Illinois for bringing this critical issue to the attention of the Senate and to the attention of the Nation. Certainly it is an issue of safety and health for many children across our country. For all of us who go out and visit schools on a regular basis, we see classrooms that are in cafeterias, in gymnasiums, and in closet space--of all things--all across this country, and that is wrong. This is an issue that has to be addressed. 
Let me also bring to the attention of my colleagues the issue that many of us hear about--the high number of jobs that are available today in the area of technology. The ITEA recently put out a study showing there are 200,000 job openings today. These are $40,000- to $60,000-a-year jobs available in technology, yet we don't have the skills or students with the skills available to go into these jobs because they haven't had the education and the experience in their schools. 
I have worked very hard to bring technology to the floor of the Senate as an issue. We have put computers into our schools, technology into our schools. In a few minutes, the Labor Committee will be working on the Reauthorization Act that includes my language to train teachers in technology throughout our schools, but if we don't pass the issue of school construction, far too many of our children will never have access to these skills because they are in classrooms where you cannot plug in a computer. 
This issue is critical and I urge my colleagues to support it. I, again, thank my colleague from Illinois for bringing it to our attention and appreciate her long concern and work on this issue.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are about to consider, I believe, one of the most important amendments that this body faces. It has to do with public education and the direction that this Congress, this Senate, this budget is going in that will affect the lives of thousands of students and their families and their neighborhoods and communities across this country. 
Mr. President, I believe one of the main principles that this country was founded on was that of education, public education, the ability for every child in this country, no matter who they are, where they come from, what their financial background is, to have a strong education, an education that will allow them to learn how to read, how to write, how to participate in a democracy, and how to be a contributing citizen to our economy once they have reached the adult age. 
Mr. President, I think it is very shocking that this budget which sits before us and the policies we are about to put in place say to students and their parents across this country that education is no longer a top priority in this country. I think that is a terrible message and one that we have to change with this budget today. Now is the time. 
Mr. President, it is amazing to me that in the fiscal year 1998 budget, the entire budget--look at this chart--2 percent of our entire Federal budget goes to education. Yet, when you ask parents and families and people across this country 
whether or not we are spending enough on education, only 9 percent of this country think we are spending too much; only 26 percent think we are spending the right amount; and 58 percent of the people in this country believe we are spending too little on education. Mr. President, I could not agree more. 
Two percent of our budget is not enough. It is not enough funds for our children, and it is the wrong message in this country, where we believe that democracy will survive if every one of our children has the access they need to a quality education--be it public or private. But in particular, in terms of what we spend here in the Nation's Capital for students across this country, it is far too little. 
The amendment that we now have before us simply establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for class size improvement, especially in the early grades. It was used as an offset for any available mandatory savings or revenues, with the exception of tobacco revenues. What this amendment does is put in place a placeholder, if you will, in the budget so when this Congress begins to listen to parents and students and families and teachers and communities across this country, we will have a placeholder in the budget that we can at our discretion put available funds into to make sure that we address the issue of class size. 
I know that class size reduction makes a difference. Every parent in this country knows that, every teacher knows that, businesses know that, and communities know that. And throughout this morning's debate, I will talk about what parents say, what students say, and what teachers say, because I believe if we begin to fundamentally address the issue of class size and the tremendous loads in our classrooms today, we will begin to address the critical need of education and make a tremendous difference for our country in the future. 
Mr. President, at this time, I will yield such time as he may need to Senator Wellstone to speak on behalf of this amendment, and then I will go into detail about my amendment and what I want to do in this budget.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Minnesota and Wisconsin for their support of this issue, for their understanding of this issue, for their backing and their commitment to making sure that we set as a priority in this country the issue of education and, most critically, the issue of class size across this country. 
Mr. President, I came to the Senate 5 years ago. And I was frustrated when I came, and I felt that leaders in Washington, DC, were not really dealing with the issues that I talked about and I worried about at home at my kitchen table every night 2,500 miles away in the State of Washington. 
I have to say that over the past 5 years we have begun to make progress and talk about the real issues that everyday families talk about at their kitchen tables every night. Certainly we have finally balanced the budget and stopped deficit spending, something that families worry about. But, more importantly, we have faced issues such as family medical leave that allows parents to take time off from their jobs to take care of a sick child. We have put 100,000 police officers on the streets because many families across this country at their kitchen tables worry about the safety of their families on a daily basis. We have addressed some of those critical issues and much more. 
But today on the floor of the Senate, I can say with certainty that this Congress, under this proposed budget, is badly missing the mark when it comes to addressing the most important concern that every parent faces today and every family talks about at their kitchen table at night. Families ask: Will my child get a good education? Will my child get the attention they deserve? Will they be safe? Will they be taught the skills they need to get a job in tomorrow's economy? Those are the kitchen table conversations that worry every single family in this country. 
Mr. President, I can tell you today I feel absolutely confident that I can speak to this issue with a lot of background and understanding. I came to the Senate with a daughter who was in 7th grade and a son who was in 10th grade. They both have spent their entire K-12 years in public education. I am a product of public education. 
Today my daughter is a senior in high school, and she is my best adviser about what is happening in our public education system. And what they say to me--what my daughter and my son say to me--is, it is difficult to learn the skills that they need when they are in crowded classrooms. They do not get the attention they need in math or science or English, and they tell me that there is what they call `hall rage' in our classrooms because of crowded classrooms with a lot of kids in our classrooms. It tends to generate a lot of frustration and rage among our children, and safety is a concern. 
Mr. President, as Senator Wellstone said, I come here as an educator. I am a former community college instructor. I taught parent education, and I also taught preschool. I had in my class twenty-four 4- and 5-year-olds. I know what a difference it makes when you reduce the number of children that are in a classroom. 
When I had 18 children in my classroom, I could take the individual time that I needed to work with these young children to help them get a grasp on the alphabet, to begin to learn to spell their names, to understand the world around them, to sit down in groups with other children and learn how to `get along' --a skill too many kids do not have today. I know what happened the next year when I had 24 children in my class--much less individual attention; it became no longer teaching, it became crowd control. 
I know as a teacher that reducing class size, particularly in the young grades, will make a difference for children across this country. 
I also come here with experience being a school board member. I have managed budgets at the school district level. I know how tough those decisions are. I know how difficult it is to meet the demands that everyday school districts have. As a school board director in a suburban district, I was frustrated with the lack of funding that we got. We were frustrated with the lack of priority that education had at the Federal level, and we were constantly frustrated that we could not do the right thing. 
I can tell you, as a schoolboard member who has managed thousands of dollars in education funding at the local level, this amendment, this goal, this direction for our country, is badly needed. 
I also come here as a former State senator. I served on the budget-writing committee in my State senate. I know what a priority education is for our States, and I know how 
difficult it is for them to address this issue. My State of Washington has the fourth worst class size in the Nation. 
If my State and other States across this country were told that this was a national priority and one that they would not just be told is a priority they have to do, but one that they got a jump-start with from the Federal level, it would make it easier for them and a priority for them to do what we are asking them to do and what they know they need to do. 
I come here today as a budget writer in the U.S. Senate. I have served on the national budget-writing committee for 5 years. I have worked diligently to reduce the deficit and to make sure that we put our priorities in place. That is why, when I look at the budget that is on the floor today, I say the priorities are not in the right place. My amendment simply puts aside a reserve fund so that when this Congress begins to do what parents are asking them to do across this country, and to make this a national priority, we have in place a deficit-neutral account that we can begin to put funds in so that we can address this absolutely critical issue. 
I have told you what my personal experience is. You have heard from several of my colleagues. But most importantly, studies back up what I have just told you. A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR Program, which compared the performance of students in grades K through 3 in small and regular-sized classes, found that students in small classes--13 to 17 students--significantly outperformed other students in math and reading every year at all grade levels across geographic areas. 
Mr. President, I have heard a number of my colleagues come to the floor and worry and fret over the fact that students are not graduating from high school with the skills they need to get into the job market. Class size makes a difference in their ability to get these skills. The studies show it. The followup study of the STAR Program in 1995 found that students in small classes in grades K through 3 continued to outperform their peers at least through grade 8 with achievement advantages, especially large for minority students. Class size reduction makes a difference. How long are we going to ignore these studies on the floor of the Senate? How long are we going to say no, not here? 
Other State and local studies have since found that students in smaller classes outperform their peers in reading and math, they perform as well or better than students in magnet or voucher schools, and that gains are especially significant among African American males. The studies back up what my experience shows, and the studies back up what every single Senator and Congressman says that they have as a goal today, which is to improve math and science and reading skills across this country. 
But we do not just have to listen to what the studies say; we should listen to what parents say. When any parent is sitting there the afternoon that their child comes home from their very first day of school in September, there are two questions that every single parent in every household across this country asks their child on that first day of school when they come home. They say: `Who is your teacher? How many students are in your classroom?' Who is your teacher? Universal questions in every home across this country. Why? Because parents know that who that teacher is and the quality of that teacher is critical 
to their child's learning for the next entire 9 months: 
`How many children are in your classroom?' Every single parent intuitively knows that their child will get a better education the smaller the class size. And I can tell you, when that student answers, `35 children, 40 children,' that parent feels, `This is not going to be a great year.' Parents know that the skills their child needs to succeed will be better learned in a smaller class size. And that is why they ask on the first day of school, `How many students are in your classroom?' 
Parents today are also concerned about children's safety. No surprise. And I can tell you as a teacher, and I know that every parent knows, that if a teacher has the ability to listen to their children, to work with their children, to prepare their children, and to really get to know those young people in their classrooms, their safety will be much, much better. And discipline will be much less of a problem, because that teacher has time to work with those tough kids that are in their classes today. 
But, we have heard what parents say. We know what the studies say. What are teachers saying? I have taken some time over the last few weeks to ask teachers what they said about class size. These are the people, the professionals that are in our classrooms every day with our young people. 
Here is what some teachers have said to me: This `is the most important improvement we can make. A working condition that in many ways is [far] more important [to me] than salary. If teachers feel like they are making progress, other complaints seem minimal. If teachers feel behind, at a loss, and overwhelmed by large classes, any other problems loom large.' 
`It's not only important for classroom management, but also for time spent evaluating each student's work, and time for individual attention with each student.' 
One teacher told me: `The difference between teaching a class of 31 high school students and teaching 28 is the difference between lion-taming and teaching.' 
Mr. President, students and teachers and parents know that class size reduction makes a difference. 
I also have a young group of students that I work with in my home State. They are called my Student Advisory Youth Involvement Team. I go to them on a regular basis, and I tell them, as young people under the age of 18, that their voice is important here in the Nation's Capital and their priorities are important as well. And I ask them how they feel about different issues that are coming before the Senate. 
I took some time to talk to some of those young students over the past several weeks about class size and what is happening in their schools and what could make a difference. Christopher Shim, who is a 17-year-old from Mercer High School, said, `In elementary school, I actually felt I was pretty lucky. I was able to get personal time with the teacher, even though we had 30-35 students in my elementary classrooms.' He continued, `In high school, I have 40 people in my calculus class. This means any time I have a question, there are 10 people in line.' 
Mr. President, we stand out here on the floor of the Senate and we talk about how important it is for our young people to get math and science skills, and yet here is a student who says when he needs help with a question in calculus, there are 10 
people consistently in line. Smaller class sizes make a difference. 
I had another student who said to me, `In [my] high school civics class, there is only one teacher teaching two classes of 40 students each. It's harder to get through the curriculum and get answers to your questions.' 
Mr. President, consistently students gave me comments. And I will be reading more of them throughout the debate. But one after the other, what these young people--who are in the classrooms today, where the stress is on them to get the good grades, to go on to college, to get a good job--what they told me consistently was that they felt that reducing class size was important. 
Are we going to listen to parents? Are we going to listen to teachers? Are we going to listen to the young people themselves? Are we going to listen to the thousands of families across our communities today who know this makes a difference, who say to their child when they come home, `How many kids are in your classroom?' because they know? Are we going to listen to the studies? Are we going to say it is the right thing to do to make this a national priority? Or today on the floor of the Senate, are we going to say no? Are we going to say that 2 percent is enough? Are we going to say that education is no longer a priority of this Government? 
I have heard too many people say, `Leave it to the local school boards. Leave it to the States. It should not be a national priority.' I could not disagree more. We cannot pass the buck any longer. Making sure that every one of our children gets a good education is a priority for every adult in this country, whether they are a parent, a community leader, a State leader, or a national leader. It is our responsibility to set the priorities within this budget. My amendment allows us to do that as the debate progresses across the rest of this year. 
Mr. President, as you know, I feel strongly about this, and I know there are a number of my colleagues who are here today who support this as well. 
I yield to the Democratic ranking member at this time for a statement.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for putting in perspective what we are talking about today. The students in my classroom weren't Republican, Democrat, or Independent. They didn't say, oh, this is a local issue; oh, this is a State issue, those Federal people should not be involved. They looked around in their classroom and said: How many kids are in here with me? Do I get time with my teacher; do I get personal attention? 
As my colleague from Illinois notes, there is no silver bullet to making education better across this country. But we have to put our efforts in places where we know they make a difference. My colleague from Illinois has addressed tirelessly the issue of crumbling schools across the country. And the issue of safety and the ability to learn, and the issue of class size, again, where school buildings simply can't expand, where our children are in unsafe situations. If together we address the crumbling schools, and class size, and if we train our teachers with the skills they need to teach effectively in our classrooms today and tomorrow, we will turn public education around. 
I know my colleague from Illinois has heard as much as I have from all those politicians and leaders who are saying public 
education has failed. I don't believe public education has failed. I believe we have failed public education. We have a responsibility to turn it around right now, today, in the Senate. I thank my colleague from Illinois. I yield to her.

Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my colleague. I absolutely agree. I believe we are at a fundamental crossroads in this country, where we are going to decide now, today, whether we are going to go down a narrow path of just letting a few kids succeed in education across this country, with vouchers, block grants, and eliminating the Federal role altogether; or we can collectively say, no, not in my country, not in my home, not in my community, not in my State. 
In this country, where we believe that public education is critical for every student, we want to go down the road that makes a difference. By making sure our crumbling schools are fixed, making sure that there are teachers who are well-trained, and making sure there is a number of students in a classroom that allows them to learn those math skills and English skills they so desperately need in today's and tomorrow's economy. I look forward to working with my colleague to make sure we go down the right road and not the wrong road. We will find out today what the Senate says.

Mr. President, the amendment that we will vote on shortly simply puts in place a deficit-neutral reserve fund for class-size improvement, especially in the early grades. And, it would use as an offset anything we designate over the coming year in available mandatory savings or revenues, except for tobacco revenues. 
I know that the chairman is going to say that this reserve fund has no money and it has not set up any specific policy on class size reduction. He is absolutely right. It is exactly what he has done in his budget with the tobacco reserve fund and with the tax cut fund. I have learned from him that if we want priorities within our budget, this is the way we go about it. 
Education is a priority. As I pointed out this morning, 2 percent of our budget goes to education. At a time when parents and families and communities and States are struggling with this issue. Parents say to us that they want their children's class sizes reduced. I have talked to parents, I have talked to students, teachers, principals. Down the road, they say, this is going to make an important difference in our children's education. 
I think the most important thing to remember is what every parent says to their child when they come home on the first day of school. They ask two questions: Who is your teacher? and how many students are in your classroom? because they know that the best qualified teacher, the best trained teacher will make a difference for their child, and they know that the number of students who are in that classroom will make a difference in their child's ability to learn and be productive and get the skills they need to grow up and get a job and be a positive member of our economy and society in the future. 
Budgets are not just about today. Yes, we have a balanced budget before us today. But, more importantly, we have to ask `will it be balanced in the future?' The only way for our budget to be balanced in the future is for us to make sure that our students, who are in school today, have adequate resources available. To make sure they get the skills they need to contribute to the economy, so that we have a strong budget in the future. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Dodd and Senator Kennedy as original cosponsors of this amendment, as well as Senator Daschle.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for offering this amendment I offered in the Budget Committee. I can tell you, as a working parent, one of the most critical issues that faces parents every single morning across this country is, will my child have a place to be? I have had the experience, and I guess that many parents across this country have had the experience, of dropping their child off at day care on a Friday and have them say to you, `We will not be here on Monday. We decided to go out of the business.' There is nothing worse that can happen to you in a day than to all of a sudden panic and try to find a place to put your child who may be 2, 3, 8, or 10, and you know they need a safe place, you know you need to be at work Monday morning, and there is nowhere for your child. 
Mr. President, across this country businesses are recognizing this critical issue because they know they need their employees to be productive. A productive employee is not sitting at work worrying about whether their child is safe or taken care of; a productive employee is one who knows their child is all right. This amendment simply puts in place a placeholder so that this Congress will address the issue that is discussed at almost every kitchen table of every family across this country. 
I thank my colleague from Connecticut for being a leader on this issue for so many years.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator Dodd, and I commend the Senator from Connecticut for attempting to make the Senate address the need to improve affordable childcare in this nation. 
Mr. President, few issues are more important in determining the future of our children and our nation than access to safe and affordable child care. Ensuring the availability of affordable, quality child care programs must be a top national priority for us as lawmakers, as parents, and as citizens. Today, we have a rare opportunity to offer hope to families struggling to find or keep their children safe and learning. 
By sponsoring this amendment, Senator Dodd has sent an important message to every American who is working hard to raise a child--we know it is sometimes difficult, and we know your government has a responsibility to assist you in your most important work. With this amendment, of which I am lead cosponsor, we make room in the budget to lay out a vision for the type of assistance the American public has told us will truly help. 
First, I must say that like many issues affecting children and families, child care is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. Senator Dodd and I have had the opportunity to work toward child care solutions with several Republican senators over the past couple of months. Although both parties and the administration have submitted differing child care proposals, I know we can all work together to create a new child care law that does what American families need. With the right mix of participation from families and communities, private industry, and government, we can create a child care system that is the envy of the world. 
But we don't have that system today. And, this is why the Senator from Connecticut's proposal is so critical to our nation's success. Because child care is not just a place you put a child until you get home from work. If we know one thing about child care today, that many of us have long intuitively known was the case, it is that child care is an enterprise defined by the quality of education and care that it provides. 
Let us examine some of what we know about child care in America today: 
Recent research about the way a child's brain develops shows us the importance of quality care to a child's healthy development. The first three years of a child's development are decisive in determining that child's future. Quality child care, with an age-appropriate developmental and educational focus, provides the early stimulation required to correctly develop a child's sensitive neural systems. 
It is time for policy-makers and the American public to reject the narrow view of early child care and education as separate entities. Early child development must now assume its place in our local and national funding priorities as an integral piece of the educational process. Child care lays the foundation required for a lifetime of learning. 
Children who experience quality care demonstrate higher language and math skills when entering school. Our first National Educational Goal is that by the year 2000 every child will enter school ready to learn. Without quality early child development programs for all children, we cannot meet this important goal. Early child development also gives children the increased self-perception and social skills that allow them to succeed in school and in life. 
We cannot continue to view child care as `just another expense.' Funding for quality care represents a wise investment in our nation's future. Studies consistently show that quality child development programs produce long-term positive social benefits. Quality care reduces the anti-social behavior and chronic delinquency which threaten the stability of our communities. Early child development must also be a priority if we truly want to halt the spread of crime. Law enforcement leaders across the nation agree that investments that create a safe and nurturing environment for children, especially in the critical hours between 3 and 10 p.m., will sharply reduce crime. 
Some early childhood services for low-income toddlers have been found to cut the number of chronic criminal offenders by 80 percent and delinquency by 90 percent. By providing children with the preparation to learn, quality child care prevents the lack of literacy and marketable skills that force many people to rely on public assistance. 
By reducing the later, more-expensive costs of public assistance and imprisonment, investment in child care can save billions of taxpayer dollars. The High Scope Preschool Study found that by providing increased tax revenues and reduced costs of crime and welfare, every dollar invested in high quality early childhood programs for low income children eventually saved $7 of taxpayer money. 
Despite the monumental consequences, the current American `system' of early child development meets neither the demand for supply, nor the quality required of it. In too many communities, parents are simply unable to find affordable, quality care. The situation is especially acute for low-income parents; the working poor currently face waiting lists in thirty-eight states. Although children from low-income families receive the most benefit from child care, they attend child development programs at only half the rate of children from high-income families. 
The 1996 welfare law dramatically increased the already urgent demand for affordable, quality child care. Welfare plans will direct over two million parents, mostly mothers, into the workforce. Without the support provided by child care which meets at least minimal standards of affordability and quality, 
few parents can afford to leave the home for the workplace. 
Too many existing child care programs fail to provide developmentally-appropriate care. Studies show that less than a tenth of child care centers provide appropriate care. A recent national study found that most centers provide care that is poor or mediocre. The widespread lack of appropriate training and experience, and the lack of safe facilities, holds long-term consequences for the health and development of American children. 
Efforts to improve K-12 education can never be fully successful when one-third of our children enter kindergarten unprepared to learn. 
We cannot not allow providers to maintain environments which harm our children. The federal government must do something to help states improve their standards--we cannot allow dangerous and inadequate child care environments to continue. A recent analysis of state regulations found that no states have child care safety regulations above the `mediocre' level. 
We must also improve standards in the half million to million unlicensed home child care businesses operating in this country. Simply because a child is in an unlicensed facility does not decrease her need for developmentally-appropriate challenges. There are things we can do to increase the kind of care that stimulates a child's early growth. 
Parents are an integral part of a child's early developmental growth and must have the opportunity to become involved in early child care programs. Parents cite lack of time as the top reason for not becoming involved in their children's education. I am proud to have sponsored the Time for Schools Act of 1997 which expands uses for time under the Family Medical Leave Act to allow parents to be involved in their children's education, or to take care of child care emergencies, without losing their job. 
There is also so much more we can do to involve parents in the care and education of their children. Across this nation, people have worked to put tools in the hands of parents, so they can make the best choices possible when it comes to the care of their children. The family is the engine that drives our economy and society. Any child care legislation must include efforts to get parents and families the information they need, whether it's about choosing quality child care, choosing to stay home and care for a child, or choosing strategies to make caring for a child safer and more affordable. 
There are things that states across the nation can learn from my the experiences of my home state of Washington. Washington state has a child care system nationally recognized for its excellence. State licensing requirements far exceed federal standards and go further than almost all state regulations towards ensuring safe child care. The state has implemented an integrated system of child care assistance for all low-moderate income families, regardless of whether they are involved in work first programs. In addition, the state legislature has instituted a training requirement for child care professionals, and provided initial funds for a training system and a registry to track that training. 
But even in a state like Washington, the lack of investment from the federal level forces difficult choices at the state level--in our case, lower subsidies which are reducing options for low-income parents. 
So whatever solutions we seek here must give assistance flexibly to states, so individual states can make improvements in the areas where they need it most. 
Two other discussions in my state are very promising, and they deserve your attention. 
First, there is the work of the Human Services Policy Center at the University of Washington. The Policy Center has reached out to leaders in the private and public sectors, and to parents and the child care community, and come up with recommendations to improve child care financing. Their study, `Financing Quality Child Care in Washington,' provides a thorough review of the state of child care financing in one state, with implications for our national debate. 
Another very exciting discussion and project is underway in Spokane, Washington, of which you all should be aware. It is a family child care demonstration home and small business center, created by a wide array of partners: 
Founding partners, including The Health Improvement Partnership of Spokane, Holy Family Hospital, the Nevada-Lidgerwood Neighborhood, and Northwest Regional Facilitators (the local child care resource and referral agency); and newer partners, including the Child Care Facility Fund of Washington State, the Dayton Hudson Foundation, Spokane Falls Community College, Eastern Washington Association for the Education of Young Children, Eastern Washington Family Child Care Association, Family Care Resources, Kathy Modigliani National Accreditation, the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, the Washington State Office of Child Care Policy, the Small Business Development Center, and the Washington State Child Care Resource and Referral Network. 
The project is called the `Family Child Care HOME (Hands On Model Environment)' and provides child care in a high quality family child care setting for children from infant to age twelve. The projects also provides orientation and training for child care providers, and a business incubation center for new family child care businesses. The HOME project partners have also set up a revolving microcredit loan program, for child care providers to purchase equipment, expand their business, acquire professional training and remodel their facilities. On site at the child care home, there is a library, equipped with toys, books, start-up supplies, videos, and child centered leaning materials for all child care providers throughout the county. In 
addition, there is a consumer education center for parents, businesses, and communities to learn more about family child care. 
I have gone into some detail today, about the state of child care in this nation, and some examples from my own home state, because the Dodd amendment gives us a chance to do something good for American families. 
The Senator from Connecticut has introduced legislation to address this issue more comprehensively than the amendment before us today. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill as well. But if we do not pass this amendment, this Senate will never even have a chance to debate the merits of the bill that could actually improve child care for working parents. 
Working Americans, many of them lower income, are in the greatest need for assistance in our current child care system; the Dodd-Kennedy-Harkin-Murray ACCESS bill would do a lot of important things to help them. It includes refundable tax credits to provide such assistance. The ACCESS bill does not mandate national standards; it gives states the funding and flexibility to make quality improvements where they see them as necessary. The bill expands Family and Medical Leave to more employees. Taken along with my `Time for Schools Act' allowing parents to take care of child care emergencies, this represents a true step forward. 
The ACCESS bill provides funding for important quality improvements, including resource and referral services --currently the best source parents have for child care information in many states. Parent education can be expanded with these funds--giving parents the kind of information and resources they are looking for. 
The bill makes several changes to promote the kind of private/public partnerships happening in my state. It sends out challenge grants and employer tax credits, but doesn't limit businesses' involvement to the children of their own employees. The quality of child care in the community as a whole will benefit from such provisions. 
But the point here today is that we will never even have a chance to pose such questions to the Senate if the Dodd amendment is rejected. That is because the budget resolution before us today does not allow us to debate childcare. It makes no provisions for addressing the childcare needs of American families. By reading this resolution, one could easily conclude the majority party in the Senate simply does not care about childcare. 
Not every partent can afford to hire a nanny to look after their children. When we begin to see child care, especially family child care, as a business opportunity, and supporting investments that lead to child care businesses becoming licensed and meeting other quality guidelines then we will begin to build capacity in our communities. We want people to enter this business, to do it well, and to succeed. 
As I mentioned, there is bipartisan agreement about the need to improve child care in this country. There must also be agreement about funding, or we will not have child care improvement this year. I can assure the American public that if Congress hears loudly enough about the interest and need for child care improvement, we will find the money for this. Within the context of a balanced budget, with or without a tobacco settlement or any other possible funding source--if this is a national priority, we can take this step. 
But the American people must weigh in, or it will not happen. Increasing the supply of quality child care must become a top national priority. Failure to do so threatens our children's future, and that of our nation. I urge my colleagues to support the Dodd amendment.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is really a great morning. After 2 years, I have the immense pleasure of voting with the majority of my colleagues to confirm two judges that I have worked very hard to get through this often difficult process. I thank my colleagues for their support of these two fine individuals, Ms. Margaret McKeown and Mr. Ed Shea. In particular, I thank our chairman, Senator Hatch, our ranking member, Senator Leahy, and my colleague, Senator Gorton, for their perseverance on behalf of these two individuals. 
I would first like to tell my colleagues about the newest judge to the Ninth Circuit, Ms. McKeown. Before coming to the Senate, I had heard across the spectrum that Ms. McKeown was one of the finest business lawyers in the northwest. Now that she and I have spent time together, I have come to understand why she had that reputation: she is tenacious, does outstanding work, is an accomplished advocate, and has the patience of Job. 
Let me summarize some of the high points of Ms. McKeown's career: 
She was the first woman partner at the 70-year-old, prestigious firm of Perkins Coie; 
She has served for 11 years on the Perkins Coie executive and management committees; 
She is a nationally recognized litigator who was named in Top Players in High Tech Intellectual Property; 
Her range of litigation is amazing: one day she is litigating about the typeface in personal computers, the next day she is defending a securities case, the next day she might be litigating avionics in military aircraft; 
She was president of the Federal Bar Association for the Western District of Washington and a lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference; 
She has worked as an aide to United States Senator Cliff Hansen of Wyoming, as a special assistant under President Carter to Interior Secretary Andrus, and as White House Fellow under President Reagan; 
She is on the executive committee of the Washington State Council on International Trade; and 
She has served as counsel for the Downtown Seattle Business Association. 
While who you know is important, and what you do as a lawyer is critical, where you put your priorities is also vital. One of the reasons I so strongly supported Ms. McKeown's nomination is because of her commitment to her community and family. 
I am amazed that the same person who represented Boeing in a multi-billion dollar merger and who has successfully defended Citibank in a complex leverage buy out case has also served in virtually every position in the Girl Scouts. She has been a Brownie leader, troop consultant, committee member, and for nine years, member of the National Board of Directors of Girl Scouts of the USA and a member of the Executive Committee. Even with her national commitments, Ms. McKeown makes time for the girls themselves, leading her daughter, Megan's, Junior Girl Scout Troop #1091. 
Ms. McKeown is active in other arenas as well. She volunteers in the schools, with YMCA, with the Children's Museum, and on abused children projects. I want to point out something else special about Ms. McKeown: She has received the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. That magazine several years ago named Ms. McKeown as one of the `100 Women of Promise in America.' 
Mr. President, Margaret McKeown is a highly-qualified lawyer with a diverse background, who has demonstrated her commitment to community and family. Now, finally, after surviving the political and judicial battles for two years, she will take her seat on the Ninth Circuit and become an outstanding judge. Congratulations, Margaret, we finally made it! 
Mr. President, I also want to thank my colleagues for confirming Mr. Shea this morning to serve on Washington's 
Eastern District Court. While Mr. Shea's road to confirmation has not been as filled with hurdles as Ms. McKeown's, it is a great pleasure to see this fine lawyer move onto the Federal bench. 
Mr. Shea will make an excellent judge. He is a highly respected member of the legal profession. He has served with distinction as a trial lawyer, including national recognition as a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers. 
The five superior court judges in Benton and Franklin counties, where Mr. Shea has lived and practiced for more than 25 years, have written a letter describing him as having a `well-earned reputation, not only in our community but throughout the Northwest, as an outstanding trial lawyer.' His fellow Washington state lawyers honored him by electing him president of the Washington State Bar Association, where he served with distinction. Many of them have approached me to congratulate me on my role in promoting Mr. Shea's judicial candidacy. 
While we must look first to his legal qualifications, I believe the best judges are those who have worked in their communities to make them better places. Mr. Shea is well-qualified in that arena, too. He has been an advocate of equal access to the law, volunteering and working to get free or reduced legal services to local organizations, such as the March of Dimes, the Sexual Assault Response Center, and the Faith Christian Academy. 
Mr. Shea also worked hard in an area nearest to my heart: education. He pushed to improve access to education in his community by helping establish a branch campus of the Washington State University in the Tri-Cities. He too has been a stalwart supporter of the March of Dimes, recently being named the Chapter Counsel of the Year by the national March of Dimes. 
Mr. Shea is a well-respected member of the business community. He has the unanimous support of the board of the Tri-City Industrial Development Council. Mr. Shea has received two strongly-supportive editorials in the Tri-City Herald. Numerous members of the business community have thanked me for championing his nomination. 
Mr. President, Mr. Shea was selected by a bi-partisan Judicial Merit Selection Committee comprised of a diverse group of lawyers and community leaders. I have faith in that selection process and believe Mr. Shea will be an outstanding member of the Federal bar. 
Let me close by saying a few words about judicial nominations and the process we have developed in Washington. As I travel around my state, people ask me why we have so many judicial vacancies. I haven't been able to give them a good answer, but can only point to political one-upmanship as the culprit. 
After this morning, I can happily report we are finally moving forward and that two excellent judicial candidates have been confirmed. 
Let me also add that while I have been the Senator of the same party as the President, I have invited and encouraged Senator Gorton to participate in judicial nominations. I recognize this is a tremendous break in tradition, but I know our citizens are best served when we work together. 
I intend to continue working with Senator Gorton to find the very best and most able members of the Washington bar to recommend to President Clinton. I will fight to ensure our citizens have their day in court and that justice is not denied because nominations are delayed. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the endorsement of my colleagues for Ms. McKeown and Mr. Shea. There are many other qualified judges waiting to move through the process. I urge the Senate to move quickly to hear and confirm them so the crisis our judiciary faces will come to an end.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the introduction of the Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998. I want to personally thank Senator Frank Murkowski, my colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the former chairman of the committee, and Senator Paul Sarbanes for joining me in introducing this legislation. 
I also want to thank the veterans service organizations that worked with us to draft this very important legislation. I particularly want to thank the veterans of my state who first brought this issue to my attention and who have been true partners in this effort. 
I introduced this legislation for a very simple reason: every day, veterans are being buried across this nation without full military honors--honors earned through service to us all. And that is not right. 
The Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998 is a common sense piece of legislation of great importance to the veterans of our country. Our bill requires the Department of Defense to provide honor guard services upon request at the funerals of our veterans. Our bill is the right thing to do. 
Our country has asked a lot of our veterans. I believe we have a responsibility to tell each and every veteran that we remember and we honor their service to our country. The Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998 gives meaning to the words `on behalf of a grateful nation,' that accompanies the presentation of the flag to the family at a funeral. 
I can speak personally to the importance of this legislation. I lost my own father last year, a World War II veteran and proud member of the Disabled American Veterans. My family was lucky. We were able to arrange for an honor guard at his service. Having the honor guard there for my family made a big difference and a lasting impression. We were all--and particularly my mother--filled with pride at a very difficult moment for our family, as Dad's service was recognized one final time. It should be this way for every family who lays a veteran to rest. 
With a downsized military, installations are no longer able to provide trained personnel to perform military honors for every veteran. Veterans service organizations have stepped in and tried to provide the color guard services for deceased fellow veterans. And by most accounts, they do a pretty good job. But VSO's cannot meet the need for color guard services. By their own admission they often lack the crispness and the precision of trained military personnel. 
Our veterans' population is getting older. More than 36,000 World War II veterans are dying each month. In my own state, close to 5,000 veterans are being laid to rest each month. We cannot expect a group of older veterans to provide these honor guard services day in and day out for their military peers. We are simply asking too much of a generation that has already given so much. 
I believe we have a responsibility to act. This bill will ensure that every veteran receives a funeral worthy of patriotic service to our country. By passing the Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998, the Congress will send a powerful message to veterans that their service to us all will never be forgotten. 
I encourage all Members of the Senate to join in this effort.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader for his continued work on this issue to try to allow us the opportunity to come here to the floor to talk about the most critical issue in this country today, which is the education of our young children. 
There is a very serious debate that ought to be had. Are we going to go down the road of vouchers and block grants and cutting out the Department of Education, where fewer and fewer children have the opportunity for an education? Or are we going to talk about the proposals that we would like to debate--whether or not our class sizes should be smaller, how we are going to train our teachers for the skills they need with our children in their schools, how we are going to deal with our classrooms that need school construction so badly across this country. There is a debate to be had. We are ready to join it. We want to have that opportunity, and we will stand behind the Democratic leader to be allowed to have that debate on this floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, I rise in strong support of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program and in opposition to the McConnell amendment. This program is the right way for our nation to provide business opportunities for all Americans. 
I believe in the goals of the DBE program: To improve economic opportunities for qualified, but disadvantaged, business owners, who most frequently are women and people of color. This program counters the effects of past discrimination with a flexible and goal-oriented program that has worked. We have a much more diverse federal contracting base than we have ever had before. Since 1978, where women- and minority-owned businesses won only 1.9 percent of the federal highway construction contracts, they have 14.8 percent. That demonstrates the tremendous success of this program. 
The DBE program does an excellent job of providing sufficient flexibility to target true disadvantaged businesses. If an African female-owned business truly is not disadvantaged, it will qualify under this program. Likewise, if a Caucasian male owns a disadvantaged business, he has an opportunity to qualify under the DBE program. That flexibility is why so many of us believe it offers us the best path forward toward true equality for all business people. It focuses our attempts to strengthen our economy on those who need our help most; it forces us to look at economics, not race or gender. 
Mr. President, in 1995, the Senate debated this issue as part of the legislative branch appropriations bill. At that time, members of this body recognized this type of proposal simply goes too far. I led the fight to defeat that amendment with bipartisan support, 61-36. As ranking member of the legislative branch appropriations bill at the time, I offered a compromise amendment in an attempt to reach middle ground and deal with this issue in a constructive manner. That amendment passed 84-13. 
I pledge to continue to fight economic, gender and race discrimination throughout this country. The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is one proven path toward that goal. This is not about special preferences or arbitrary set asides; this is about expanding opportunities for business people. I intend to oppose the McConnell amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mrs. Murray. Mr. President, soon after the upcoming recess, I will join my colleague, Senator Slade Gorton, to introduce the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act. The ocean Dungeness crab fishery in WA, OR, and CA has been successfully managed by the three states for many years. The states cooperate on season openings, male-only harvest requirements, and minimum sizes; and all three states have enacted limited entry programs. Although the resource demonstrates natural cycles in abundance, over time the fishery has been sustained at a profitable level for fishermen and harvesters with no biological programs. 
The fishery is conducted both within state waters and in the federal exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although state landing laws restrict fishermen to delivering crab only to those states in which they are licensed, the actual harvest takes place along most of the West Coast, roughly from San Francisco to the Canadian border. Thus, it is not unusual for an Oregon-licensed fisherman from Newport to fish in the EEA northwest of Westport, WA, and deliver his catch to a processor in Astoria, OR. 
In recent yeas, federal court decisions under the umbrella of U.S. v. Washington have held that Northwest Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest a share of the crab resource off Washington. To accommodate these rights, the State of Washington has restricted fishing by Washington-licensed fishermen. This led Washington fishermen to request an extension of state fisheries jurisdiction into the EEZ. The Congress partially granted this request during the last Congress by giving the West Coast states interim authority over Dungeness crab, which expires in 1999 (16 U.S.C. 1856 note). The Congress also expressed its interest in seeing a fishery management plan established for Dungeness crab and asked the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) to report to Congress on this issue by December, 1997. 
The PFMC established an industry committee to examine the issues, which developed several options. At its June meeting, the PFMC selected two options for further development and referred them for analysis to the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee which operates under the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. After lengthy debate, the Tri-State Committee recommended to the Council that the Congress be requested to make the interim authority permanent with certain changes, including a clarification of what license is required for the fishery, broader authority for the states to ensure equitable access to the resource, and clarification of tribal rights. The Tri-State Committee agrees that each state's limited entry laws should apply only to vessels registered in that state. I ask unanimous consent to include the report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee and the membership list of the Committee in the Record. 
On September 12, 1997, the PFMC unanimously agreed to accept and support the Tri-State Committee recommendation. The Council agreed that the existing management structure effectively conserves the resource, that allocation issues are resolved by the restriction on application of state limited entry laws, that tribal rights are protected, and that the public interest in conservation and fiscal responsibility after better served by the legislative proposal than by developing and implementing a fishery management plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This legislation will fully implement the Tri-State Committee recommendation and ensure the conservation and sound management of this important West Coast fishery. 
I look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this bill.   
Report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee to the Pacific Fishery Management Council on Options for Dungeness Crab Fishery Management, August 7, 1997 
The Tri State Dungeness Crab Committee met on August 6-7, 1997 to review the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) Analysis of Options for Dungeness Crab Management. A list of the attending Committee members, advisors, and observers is attached. After completing that review, the Committee discussed the merits of each option and offered the following comments for PFMC consideration. 
There was general agreement within the Committee that Option 1, No Action, would not satisfy the current needs of the industry. There was unanimous opposition, however, among Oregon and California representatives to Option 3, Development of a Limited Federal Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Washington representatives were not strongly in favor of a FMP, but viewed it as the only realistic means to address their concerns for the fishery. After an extended discussion, it was the consensus of the Committee that a modified version of Option 2, Extension of Interim Authority, was preferred. 
There were three common themes that appeared during the discussion. No Committee members believed that there should be fishing or processing of Dungeness crab in waters of the EEZ under PFMC jurisdiction by any vessel not permitted or licensed in either Washington, Oregon, or California. The Committee generally accepted that additional tools beyond area closures and pot limits could be needed to address tribal allocation issues. Finally, the Committee also agreed that as a matter of fairness, vessels fishing alongside each other in an area should be subject to the same regulations. On that basis, the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee recommends that: 
1. The PFMC immediately request that Congress make the current Interim Authority a permanent part of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, applying only to Pacific coast Dungeness crab, with the following adjustments.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Burns, the chairman of the committee, who has done an outstanding job in leading our way through this bill. 
Mr. President, the Senate today once again is addressing the line-item veto exercised by the President of 38 projects that were included in the fy 98 military construction appropriations bill. 
Last fall, the Congress and the American people were informed of a list of 38 projects included in the military construction appropriations bill that fell victim to the President's new line-item veto authority. 
The administration cited three criteria that were used in determining whether the President should veto certain projects. 
The first criteria is that the project was not included in the President's fy 98 budget request. However, in creating our fy 98 military construction bill, it should be noted that careful thought went into considering the President's requests, the priorities included in the Department of Defense's five-year plan, and due consideration for the Guard and Reserve projects that are too often woefully overlooked by the Department in fashioning its request. 
We balanced these interests with the interests of our constituents and the American people to come up with a comprehensive, reasoned and well-rounded list of projects that will benefit our country. 
This balancing of interests is consistent with committee practice--particularly with regard to Guard and Reserve matters. The budget is not perfect, and Congress must act affirmatively to make the most responsible decisions. 
The second criteria demanded by the White House is that the project was not a quality of life project, such as housing, dining, clinics, child care or similar family-oriented facilities. 
This has always been my number one priority, and in fact, the subcommittee added many such quality of life projects on its own initiative. 
I know the President shares my concern for quality-of-life initiatives, but there needs to be some give and take on both our parts to ensure that not only are we providing our men and women in uniforms with a high quality of life, but we are doing this without sacrificing our readiness capabilities. 
The third and final criteria offered by the White House, which we were told had to be met by all projects selected, is that the project must be executable in fiscal year 1998. 
Inexplicably, the administration claimed none of the projects were executable. However, this was not the case at all. In fact, all the projects included in the FY 98 Senate-passed bill were in fact executable. 
By a standard set by the subcommittee itself along with recommendations of the Armed Services Committee, every project was deemed executable. Furthermore, the executable status of these projects was confirmed in Department of Defense reports. 
Mr. President, the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senators Stevens and Byrd, rejected the vetoed items as an inappropriate overreaching of authority on the part of the administration. 
I am gratified that the committee has stood up for the subcommittee's work. It is a substantially better product than the budget submitted by the President, and that is our job. The administration has no exclusive corner on wisdom in making its selection of projects. 
Mr. President, the Senate passed a resolution of disapproval, rejecting the President's veto of the projects in the military construction bill last October 30, 1997. 
Under the terms of the Line-Item Veto Act, the President then exercised his veto power of this Senate resolution. It is that final Presidential veto that we are attempting to override today, and thereby reinstate the viability of the projects originally subjected to his line-item veto pen. 
While it is clear that the entire question as to the constitutionality of the line-item veto law is being considered by the Supreme Court and will be ruled on in the next few months, that nevertheless should have no impact on Senators' votes on the matter before us. 
I suggest that Senators need not address their position on the constitutionality or wisdom of the line-item veto legislation itself to vote for this resolution. It was supported by 69 Senators last October, and I would hope it has at least that much support this afternoon when we vote on it again. 
A vote for this measure is a vote against the administration's blatant exercise of power that was sloppy and rushed and resulted in many errors. 
The subcommittee and full committee, as well as membership of both houses, labored over a period of several months to scrub the budget and add only those projects that were deemed worthy. 
I hope that this measure will receive the strong support of the full Senate as it has in the past, and that this will be the end of this matter. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Seattle's African American community loses a visionary and much respected leader when the Rev. Dr. Samuel B. McKinney steps down after four decades of service at the Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle. Dr. McKinney is well known throughout the region as a tireless advocate for social justice, supporter of youth and proponent of economic development. 
Samuel Berry McKinney was born in Michigan, and raised in Ohio. He entered Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he became friends with a fellow minister's son, Martin Luther King, Jr. His college career was interrupted by a tour of service in the U.S. Army, but he returned to Morehouse to earn his degree in 1949. He then continued his education at Colgate Rochester Divinity School, graduating in 1952. 
Dr. McKinney began his ministry at Mt. Zion on the first Sunday of February 1958. His ministry would become the longest in the church's 107-year history as well as one of the most accomplished. 
He quickly established himself as an energetic and ambitious young pastor. In 1961, Dr. McKinney invited his college friend, Dr. King, to participate in a lecture series presented by the Brotherhood of Mount Zion Baptist Church, a program started by Dr. McKinney. It would be Dr. King's only visit to Seattle and had a lasting impact on Seattle's African American community. 
Mt. Zion has flourished under Dr. McKinney's leadership. The membership has more than tripled in size. An educational wing was constructed in 1963 and a new sanctuary in 1975. The church was a forerunner in accredited, church-site, preschool and kindergarten education. The Feeding Ministry provides meals to hundreds of homeless persons, seniors and shut-ins each week. Mt. Zion's six choirs provide music for the church and community at large. 
Mt. Zion's work on behalf of children has been especially noteworthy and reflects Dr. McKinney's belief in educational achievement. The Educational Excellence Program presents annual awards to students from kindergarten to grade 12. The Scholarship Ministry annually provides an average of over $25,000 for undergraduate and graduate school education. The Youth Credit Union brings to participants training and experience in responsible financial management. 
Dr. McKinney is well known in local and national church circles. He has served as a leader of the American Baptist Convention USA. He was the first African American president of the Church Council of Greater Seattle from 1965 to 1967. He has served as Advisor on Racism to the World Council of Churches, and as a representative to WCC's Seventh Assembly. 
Dr. McKinney's leadership has extended beyond the religious community to the community at large. He has been active on the community, regional and state level. He was an original member of the Seattle Human Rights Commission and served for 12 years on the Washington State Commission for Vocational Education. He was founder of the Seattle Opportunities Industrialization Center and served as President of the Board of Directors for 20 years. He was a charter member of Seattle's first African American bank and served on the Advisory Board of Directors for the 1990 Goodwill Games. He has served as Chair of the Washington State Rainbow Coalition. 
For his many works of community service, Dr. McKinney was awarded the YMCA's prestigious A.K. Guy Award. He was also honored by his alma mater with the hanging of his portrait in the Chapel of Morehouse. 
Even with retirement growing near, Dr. McKinney remains involved in a variety of community activities. They include membership on the boards of the Fred Hutchinson Research Center, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, the Seattle Foundation and the Washington Gives Foundation. He is also a member of the Housing Commission of the National Baptist Convention, USA. 
At Dr. McKinney's side throughout his years of service has been his wife, Louise Jones McKinney. Mrs. McKinney, retired from the Seattle Public Schools where she was Director of Academic Achievement, shares her husband's deep commitment to community service and to encouraging academic progress. The McKinneys have passed their values and work ethic to their accomplished daughters. Lora-Ellen McKinney earned her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and has received awards for her innovative work with children. Rhoda Eileen McKinney Jones has a graduate degree from Columbia University School of Journalism and writes for many national church publications. 
I know that Dr. McKinney will continue to make his mark on the community. I wish him the best of success in his future endeavors.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the last 5 years we have been debating the issue of campaign finance reform and for the last 5 years we have failed to fix the system that most Americans agree is broken. I have voted for campaign reform legislation several times now, and each time it has been killed off by filibuster. Today we are once again presented with the opportunity to do what is right and stop the rising tide of special interest money that is drowning the democratic process. 
We last debated the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill in October. Since that time the bipartisan group of Senators committed to reform has continued to work together to build a coalition and to craft a measure that is fair and offers meaningful change. I have been proud to support that effort. 
Changing the status quo has been an uphill battle. The opponents of reform cleverly disguise their argument. They wrap themselves in the flag and posture as protectors of `free speech.' They make complicated and convoluted arguments about `threats to the Constitution.' but here's what they are really saying: if you have more money, you are entitled to more influence over campaigns and elections. People out there find this argument to be a cynical charade and it's time to stop playing games. 
The opponents of reform are just not listening. The American people have been calling for reform for years, and now the call is louder than ever. Eighty-nine percent of the American people believe fundamental changes are needed in the way campaigns are funded. We were elected to represent the American people. We cannot continue to ignore their wishes. 
The campaign system is clogged with money, and there is no room left for the average voter. The last time we debated reform, I told a story of a woman who sent my campaign a small contribution of fifteen dollars. With her check she enclosed a note that said, `please make sure my voice means as much as those who give thousands.' With all due respect, this woman is typical of the people who deserve our best representation. Sadly, under the current campaign system, they rarely do. 
In 1996, $2.4 billion was raised by parties and candidates. Let me say that again: $2.4 billion flowed into campaigns all across the country and dictated the terms of our elections. And as if that weren't enough, hundreds of millions more were spent on so-called `issue advocacy'. Nobody knows exactly how much more because these ads, even though they are political, are unregulated. 
Currently there is no disclosure requirement for these expenditures, there is no ban on corporate or union money, and there is no limit on how much can be spent. `Issue ads' frequently take the form of negative attacks made against candidates by groups that no one has ever heard of. Because of the current weak laws, the American people don't know who are making these charges, what their agenda is and who is paying for it. The bill we are considering today would change that by strengthening the definition of political advertising to include these sorts of expenditures. We need more accountability, not less. 
My first Senate campaign was a grassroots effort. I was out spent nearly three-to-one by a congressional incumbent. But because I had a strong, people-based effort, I was able to win. I am proud of the contributions I have received for my campaign. 
And I am willing to put my money where my mouth is. I hope to offer an amendment to implement full disclosure of campaign contributions. Under current law, the names and addresses of contributors who give more than $50 at a time or $200 in aggregate must be disclosed. My amendment would drop those numbers down to zero. Under my amendment every contribution to a PAC or a campaign must be disclosed. 
Having full disclosure for campaign contributions is like listing the nutritional facts on a candy bar: the public deserves to know what it's made of. 
But I also want to make a pledge. Whether or not my amendment passes, I still intend to tell my constituents everything about who is contributing to my campaign. I will make full disclosure of all my contributions, no matter how big or how small. This is my commitment, this is my pledge. I challenge all of my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. President, the opponents of reform miss the point. In America, money does not equal speech. More money does not entitle one to more speech. The powerful are not entitled to a greater voice in politics than average people. In America, everyone has an equal say in our Government. That is why our Declaration of Independence starts with, `We, the people.' 
Mr. President, I believe we have made this debate way too complicated. This issue boils down to one basic question: Are you for reform, or against is? Are you with the people, or against them on the need for a more healthy democracy? The votes we are taking today will show the answers to these questions. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, soon after the upcoming recess, I will join my colleague, Senator Slade Gorton, to introduce the Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act. The ocean Dungeness crab fishery in WA, OR, and CA has been successfully managed by the three states for many years. The states cooperate on season openings, male-only harvest requirements, and minimum sizes; and all three states have enacted limited entry programs. Although the resource demonstrates natural cycles in abundance, over time the fishery has been sustained at a profitable level for fishermen and harvesters with no biological problems. 
The fishery is conducted both within state waters and in the federal exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although state landing laws restrict fishermen to delivering crab only to those states in which they are licensed, the actual harvest takes place along most of the West Coast, roughly from San Francisco to the Canadian border. Thus, it is not unusual for an Oregon-licensed fisherman from Newport to fish in the EEZ northwest of Westport, WA, and deliver his catch to a processor in Astoria, OR. 
In recent years, federal court decisions under the umbrella of U.S. versus Washington have held that Northwest Indian tribes have treaty rights to harvest a share of the crab resource off Washington. To accommodate these rights, the State of Washington, has restricted fishing by Washington-licensed fishermen. This led Washington fishermen to request an extension of state fisheries jurisdiction into the EEZ. The Congress partially granted this request during the last Congress by giving the West Coast states interim authority over Dungeness crab, which expires in 1999 (16 U.S.C. 1856 note). The Congress also expressed its interest in seeing a fishery management plan established for Dungeness crab and asked the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) to report to Congress on this issue by December, 1997. 
The PFMC established an industry committee to examine the issues, which developed several options.

After lengthy debate, the Tri-State Committee recommended to the Council that the Congress be requested to make the interim authority permanent with certain changes, including a clarification of what license is required for the fishery, broader authority for the states to ensure equitable access to the resource, and clarification of tribal rights. The Tri-State Committee agrees that each state's limited entry laws should apply only to vessels registered in that state. I ask unanimous consent to include the report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee and the membership list of the Committee in the Record following my remarks. 
On September 12, 1997, the PFMC unanimously agreed to accept and support the Tri-State Committee recommendation. The Council agreed that the existing management structure effectively conserves the resource, that allocation issues are resolved by the restriction on application of state limited entry laws, that tribal rights are protected, and that the public interest in conservation and fiscal responsibility after better served by the legislative proposal than by developing and implemeting a fishery management plan under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This legislation will fully implement the Tri-State Committee recommendation and ensure the conservation and sound management of this important West Coast fishery. 
I look foward to the Senate's timely consideration of this bill. 
Report of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee to the Pacific Fishery Management Council on Options for Dungeness Crab Fishery Management, August 7, 1997 
The Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee met on August 6-7, 1997 to review the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) Analysis of Options for Dungeness Crab Management. A list of the attending Committee members, advisors, and observers is attached.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to express my frustration and concern with the opposition to the nomination of Dr. Satcher as the new Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. I will not reiterate what has been said here today about Dr. Satcher's outstanding credentials or his outstanding work as head of the Centers for Disease Control. This has been well documented. I do not wish to lengthen the debate any more than necessary. Dr. Satcher is an ideal candidate who should already be serving the American people as our Surgeon General. 
I come here today to unmask some of my Colleagues who are attempting to further delay the nomination of Dr. Satcher to advance their own political agenda. They are not opposing him because his is not qualified, but rather because he stands with the President, and the Supreme Court in defense of a women's right to adequate medical care that protects her life and health. 
What my Colleagues on the other side are attempting to do is to ask a nominee for the position of Surgeon General to disregard the law and acceptable medical practice. This is what the debate is about. 
I have heard and read other concerns expressed by opponents, but interestingly enough these issues were not debated at any great length during the Committee process. This would have been the opportunity to air these other issues or concerns. Instead they chose to block the nomination on the floor all because Dr. Satcher believes in protecting the health and life of women. They are trying to do what they could not and would not do in the Labor and Human Resources Committee. They did not have the votes. 
I have listened to many of my Colleagues come to the floor as champions of women's health care. I see bill after bill being introduced in the Senate, all in the name of protecting or improving women's health. But, when it comes to really protecting women's health many of these same Senators are silent or stand in direct conflict with what is good for women's health. 
Women's health is not just about breast cancer or cardiovascular disease. We all know that these are important women's health concerns and issues, but women's health also includes reproductive health. Dr. Satcher recognizes this fact and realizes the importance of standing for women's health. 
In addition to the reproductive health issues involved here today, I think I should remind many of my Colleagues that we need a Surgeon General and we need one now. The American people need someone who they can trust and depend on as they try to negotiate through a more complicated and frustrating health care delivery system than any of us ever envisioned. We need someone who will talk to us about health care and access to health care, especially prevention services. While there is little consensus on what reforms or changes need to be made in the way our health care system currently delivers care, the one thing that we all can agree on is consumers need more information that speaks to their needs and concerns. It is no wonder so many of my constituents are concerned about the increasing role of non medical personal in making their health care decisions. Who else is out there talking to consumers, besides insurance companies? 
For those of you so concerned about women's health, keep in mind that women are the true health care consumers in most American families. They pick the family doctor; they take care of the sick child; they make the doctors appointments for the aging parent; and they worry the most about lack of information available to make informed decisions. 
Let's end this debate and move to vote on the nomination of an outstanding doctor to be our new Surgeon General. We all know that there will be another day to debate the issues surrounding late term abortions. This has become an annual event so we do not need to delay the nomination of Dr. Satcher simply to have yet another debate on late term abortion.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, in just a few days, the Department of Energy will lose one of its best, most able and selfless public servants. Al Alm, Assistant Secretary for the Department of Energy's Environmental Management program, is leaving federal service on January 31. 
Al epitomizes the best in public service. Integrity and responsibility are his hallmarks. He has left those marks throughout the government, in academia, and in private industry. Al's government service has included positions in the Atomic Energy Commission, the Bureau of the Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Environmental Protection Agency, and two stints in the Department of Energy. He has been a tireless advocate for the programs in which he has been involved, most notably for me, cleanup of our nation's most polluted former defense nuclear production sites. 
I personally found Al to be the most accessible and helpful assistant secretary in the administration. He worked closely with me, other members of the Washington congressional delegation, our staffs, and our constituents to ensure Hanford's most important programs received adequate funding and support. Al's steadfast support for Hanford, in the face of so many competing needs, has been outstanding. Whether it is safety, funding, expediting work, or employee concerns, he has been out in front. I will sorely miss Al. 
Al has accomplished a lot in the 20 months in which he has served as the leader of Environmental Management. He has led the charge in revitalizing management and focusing energy on getting sites--and programs--closed, or well on their way to closure, by 2006. The billions of dollars and decades of time saved are extraordinary in themselves, but the public health and environmental protection are the real, tangible results of his efforts. He has helped us develop a goal and start moving toward that goal. 
Mr. President, I want to say a big thank you to Al Alm on behalf of myself and my Senate colleagues. We will miss him and his leadership of a very difficult, complex and controversial program. We wish him all the best in whatever endeavors he undertakes and hope he leaves knowing how much we have appreciated his enthusiasm and hard work.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a distinguished citizen of the great state of Washington, Mr. Doug Scott. Doug was recently recognized by the Sierra Club with the 105-year-old organization's highest award, the John Muir Award. The Sierra Club presents this award to honor individuals with a `distinguished record of leadership--such as to continue John Muir's work of preservation and establishment of parks and wilderness.' 
Doug Scott has certainly perpetuated the vision and leadership of John Muir throughout his years of commitment to the environment. Beginning his career of dedication to the environment in 1967 by joining the Sierra Club, Doug moved from his first involvement in the public policy process to be one of the original founders of Earth Day. From 1973 to 1977 Doug was the Sierra Club's Northwest field representative. In 1980, Doug became the National Conservation Director of the Sierra Club and in 1988, the organization's Associate Executive Director. In 1990, Doug left the Sierra Club for the beautiful San Juan Islands in my state of Washington to direct the San Juan Community Theater in Friday Harbor. Doug is now the Executive Director of a local, grass-roots environmental organization, Friends of the San Juans. 
It is in this most recent capacity that I have come to most appreciate Doug's skills and abilities. Doug is an essential member of the Northwest Straits Citizen's Advisory Commission that I convened with Congressman Metcalf. This local citizen's advisory commission is designed to assess the resource protections needs and values of the Northwest Straits marine environment and to explore the best ways to provide protections for this exquisite natural area. Doug's participation in this process has been invaluable. His deep commitment to protection of the marine environment combined with his thoughtful, innovative, and pragmatic approach has provided real progress for the Commission as it works through its mandate. Doug's ability to work with individuals with differing idealogies and perspectives in a cooperative and productive manner is a true asset to the Commission, and to the Northwest Straits as well. 
In Doug's remarks at the Annual Awards Dinner, he said: 
Much as this award is personally gratifying. I prefer to think of it as recognition for an era in the growth and growing effectiveness of the Sierra Club and the citizen environmental movement. Each achievement during that era was the work of many hands. This award is for all of the Sierra Club volunteers and other activists that have proven that in this democracy, working together, an engaged citizenry can make a tremendous difference. I discovered the power of citizen activism over 25 years ago in the Sierra Club and now I see its impact every day in my work in the San Juan Islands. 
The Sierra Club has chosen well in awarding Doug Scott the John Muir Award. I applaud their decision and I applaud Doug Scott. I thank him for his commitment to the environment of the San Juan Islands, the Northwest Straits, Washington state, and the United States. Great work, Doug. Congratulations.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there are very few pieces of legislation that we will act on that has the kind of impact that S. 830 will have on improving the quality of lives for millions of Americans. Ultimately, this legislation will impact every Member of this body. S. 830 represents a historic piece of legislation that will reform and modernize the Food and Drug Administration. 
This legislation will result in the more rapid approval of new, lifesaving drugs and medical devices without jeopardizing a strong public health protection role for the FDA. Millions of people will have access to break through medical technology faster. More children will also benefit from the rapid improvement in drugs and devices to treat serious and life-threatening illness. And, finally the FDA will be given the resources it needs to meet the challenges and demands of protecting the public health and approving safe and effective drugs in a more timely manner. 
When I made the decision to seek a seat on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee I did so because I wanted to be directly involved in the development of education and public health reform. I am proud to have worked with Chairman Jeffords in his effort to shepherd through the FDA reform legislation. I know that at times this was a difficult task and his leadership and patience were truly tested. I want to thank him for his willingness to forge a bipartisan bill that addressed many of the concerns that I had early in the process. I also want to thank Senator Kennedy for his efforts on behalf of patients and consumers. Senator Kennedy's hard work and commitment to a strong public health role for FDA resulted in some real improvements in this legislation. 
The fact that we have before us today a bipartisan reform agreement is in itself a historic accomplishment. Prior to the 105th Congress I thought that I had a pretty good understanding of how the agency worked and where improvements needed to be made. What I discovered is that the drug and device approval process from lab to patient is a complex process involving numerous steps. The pressure on the FDA to improve safe and effective drugs and devices with minimal delay is overwhelming. In addition, the FDA must regulate billion dollar industries that have almost unlimited resources. What I have learned from this process is that the FDA is by far one of the most important public health agencies, but it is also one that we all seem to take for granted.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to encourage the Senate to adopt H.R. 1090. This legislation is identical to my bill, S. 464, to address the issue of clear and unmistakable error. S. 464 was unanimously reported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee on which I proudly serve. I want to extend my thanks to both the chairman and ranking member of our committee for moving this important legislation in a timely and bipartisan manner . 
Importantly, this legislation has been adopted by the House in three consecutive Congresses. Congressman Lane Evans has long championed this legislation; I commend him for his persistent and determined leadership. This legislation has also long been a priority issue to the Disabled American Vetetans. It has been a pleasure for me to work with the DAV here in Washington, DC and with local DAV representatives in Washington State. 
Clear and unmistakable errors are errors that have deprived and continue to deprive veterans of benefits for which their entitlement is undeniable. The status quo denies benefits to a small number of veterans who are legally entitled to the benefits in question. To deny a veteran a legally entitled benefit due to a bureaucratic error or other mistake is beyond comprehension in my mind. 
In recent months, I've handled several cases with the Department of Veterans Affairs that directly involved clear and unmistakable error. In one case, a veteran with a serious shoulder injury dating back to the Vietnam war was rated incorrectly for more than 20 years. In another case, a veteran with PTSD also dating to service in Vietnam was misdiagnosed for a lengthy period affecting his disability rating and benefits and the treatment he received. My legislation seeks to correct this. I believe that we must make available every opportunity to right a wrong on behalf of a veteran. 
To the VA's credit, some cases of clear and unmistakable error are reversible but it depends on where the veteran is in the VA process. S. 464 and H.R. 1090 will codify the VA's current regulatory authority to review ratings decision based on claim of clear and unmistakable error. 
Unfortunately, some cases of clear and unmistakable error no longer offer recourse to the veteran. S. 464 and H.R. 1090 will allow a veteran to request that the Board of Veterans' Appeals review its prior decision based on a claim of clear and unmistakable error. A veteran would also have the opportunity to challenge the Board of Veterans' Appeals decision at the Court of Veterans' Appeals. 
The Congressional Budget Office has determined that this legislation is budget neutral. This legislation will not require additional resources for the VA or take needed resources from other VA programs or benefits. 
So often we in Congress talk about providing for veterans or about meeting our obligations to veterans. That is what this bill is all about; it gives a veteran the right to request a review rather than subjecting an ailing vet to a sometimes faceless bureaucracy hesitant to correct its mistakes. In passing this legislation, the Senate will stand with veterans that have been deprived of benefits for which their entitlement is undeniable. 
Many veterans have waited decades for this day. The Senate should end this wait now with a strong vote. A strong vote will also send a message to President Clinton. In closing, I call upon President Clinton to bring this legislative effort to a successful conclusion; to join us all to ensure that the system errs on behalf of a deserving veteran rather than the Federal Government.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue of great importance to Washington state. I remain deeply concerned about the Administration's lack of progress in working with interested Senators and industry to craft a workable, effective solution for modernizing the United States export controls on products with encryption capabilities. I have been involved in this debate for a long time, too long. We need to take action. 
I am an original cosponsor of several encryption legislative initiatives introduced by Senator Burns and Senator Leahy. Both of these Senators continue to do extraordinary work on this issue and I commend them for their thoughtful leadership. The Burns and Leahy bills basically say that if strong encryption is generally available or comparable encryption is available from foreign vendors, then our U.S. companies--the ones dominating the computer industry--should be able to sell their products as well. Previously, I also introduced similar legislation on encryption. 
I simply do not understand the Administration's continued refusal to acknowledge technological and marketplace realities when it has embraced the use of technology in so many ways. 
Computer users are demanding the ability to communicate securely over the Internet and to store data safely on their personal computers. We have all heard the stories about hackers monitoring our communications and even financial transactions, while at the same time gaining access to our hard drives while we are looking at a certain website. Until consumers have confidence that transactions and communications are secure, I do not believe that we will ever see the full potential of the communication technologies that are currently available and those to be developed in the future. 
I was hopeful late last year that the Administration had taken a very small, positive step on encryption exports. Instead, the result was basically the status quo. Computer software publishers and hardware manufacturers are still limited to shipping the same old 40-bit encryption unless they agree to design key recovery systems according to a government mandated standard. Ultimately, due to economics and marketing issues in the computer world, most Americans are still limited to this 40-bit strength encryption as well, because our companies develop one product for worldwide distribution. 
What will it take for the federal government to learn that consumers are opposed to having `Big Brother' interfere with their technology choices. We all remember the failed Administration attempts on Clipper I and Clipper II. Yet, the federal government persists in its efforts to peek into the private lives of law-abiding American citizens. The latest salvo by FBI Director Louis Freeh in demanding government mandated encryption for domestic users is the latest example of government obstruction of private decisions by American consumers and business opportunities for American innovators. If Director Freeh gets his way, the federal government will have even greater authority to peer and peek into the private lives of American citizens. `Big Brother' as feared by law-abiding Americans has a powerful champion at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
While this war of attrition is taking place, we are losing in the trenches. Foreign vendors are happily supplying stronger 128-bit encryption to our foreign purchasers. Some of these vendors have publicly thanked the U.S. government for helping them to develop thriving businesses. Importantly, current U.S. policy represents a surrender of an industry where our innovative workers and companies are technologically superior. We are surrendering jobs and economic opportunities both today and for the long term. There are many examples from my own State of Washington, usually small start-up firms eager to grow, diversify and develop new high-tech applications in computer hardware and software. These firms regularly point out to me the names and business histories of their foreign competitors that have gladly taken business opportunities from Washington firms restricted by ineffective government mandates. 
It is time for the United States to acknowledge that we no longer exclusively control the pace of technology. Purchasers around the world can download software off of the Internet from any country by simply accessing a website. Foreign purchasers have turned to Russian, German, Swiss and other foreign vendors for their encryption needs. We are truly trying to put the genie back in the bottle--a genie so nimble that it can transfer in seconds from one location to another using a modem over a traditional telephone line. 
U.S. law enforcement seems to believe that Americans will recapture this market once our industry has developed key recovery systems for 128-bit or stronger encryption technology. This is extremely naive in my opinion. All the world will know that the U.S. government approved export technology will enable U.S. law enforcement to view encrypted information. Most foreigners believe the U.S. government will use this capability to spy on them; for law enforcement, political and economic information. Foreigners will simply buy elsewhere, period. It's pretty simple to me. What foreign entity would want to surrender information to the U.S. government when they can easily avoid this by purchasing someone else's product? 
Again, I turn to the approach advocated by Senator Burns and Senator Leahy. S. 909 as adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee simply does not go far enough. While it makes some minor modifications to export controls, it also goes in the totally wrong direction by starting down the path of domestic controls on encryption. 
Washington state and American companies deserve the opportunity to compete free from government restrictions. Their role in the international marketplace should be determined by their ingenuity and creativity rather than an outdated, ineffectual system of export controls. The time to act is now, the longer we wait, the further behind America gets on this issue.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join the Washington World Affairs Council in congratulating Mr. Keith Forest of Decatur High School in Federal Way, Washington, as the very first recipient of the World Educator Award. 
The World Affairs Council is a 1,200 member nonprofit organization of business and community leaders with more than 40 years of experience bringing the world to Washington State. Through its many programs, including the Global Classroom, the World Affairs Council has been an instrumental force in educating the people of my State about the world around us; our varied and diverse cultures, changing political and security environments, and of course, the importance of international trade. It is appropriate and noteworthy that this widely respected organization would annually recognize a World Educator in our State. 
On December 6, 1997, Mr. Keith Forest will be presented with the World Educator Award. This award recognizes an outstanding teacher of the world including global cultures, contemporary world issues and world languages. 
I would like to join the World Affairs Council in acknowledging and recognizing Keith Forest for his invaluable contributions to our children's understanding of the world. Keith Forest has been a teacher for more than 25 years. His own experience as a student of the world has been shared with thousands of students and future leaders. 
Mr. Forest does not rely on easily outdated texts to teach about the ever changing world, but instead has designed his own curriculum. As a frequent traveler, Mr. Forest brings to his class slides and videos and stories from around the globe. The posters of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution and the pottery shards used by his archeology students are tangible examples of how Keith Forest's teaching brings world history to life. 
Mr. Forest has taught social studies at Decatur High School in Washington State for 15 years and his reputation precedes him through the halls. Students line up to take his classes, knowing the hands-on, in-depth exposure they will receive in his class. His passion and enthusiasm for helping his students grasp socio-political concepts and foreign affairs easily transfers to his eager classroom participants.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report to accompany the fiscal year 1998 Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bills, but I am also sadly disappointed in the actions of the other body concerning my amendment to clarify the family violence option. 
The conference report before us today in the result of a bipartisan effort that focused on the priorities important to American families; education, a safe work place, biomedical research and disease prevention, child care, Headstart, and low-income energy assistance. I was proud to work with my colleagues in producing this conference report. I want to thank Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin for their willingness to work with all of us in negotiating a final bill with the other body. I also want to thank both of them for including many of my priorities in this final legislation. 
I am pleased that we were able to increase our commitment to the Older Americans Act programs, breast and cervical cancer research, heart disease prevention, literacy, child care, Headstart, and maintain a strong Federal role in education. I know that in a balanced budget framework meeting these priorities was a difficult task and am grateful for the leadership shown by Senators Specter and Harkin. 
While I worked to ensure the enactment of important increases in our investment in our future, I am sadly disappointed that this final conference report does not include my amendment to protect victims of domestic violence and abuse from the harsh punitive requirements called for in welfare reform. Despite a 98 to 1 vote in the Senate, Republicans on the conference committee from the other body, refused to help victims of family violence from continued abuse. This is a big loss that will come back and haunt us as the States begin full implementation of their welfare reform plans. 
The Republicans in the other body seemed more concerned about grossly incorrect statements made by the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Resources. It was interesting to see that the chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee felt it necessary to attend the final conference meeting to ensure that there was no further effort to give States the flexibility that they need to truly help those victims of domestic violence. 
In a letter to the conferees, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee concluded that the way to break the cycle of violence was to improve the self esteem of moms; this could only be accomplished through work. This statement in itself explains the difficulty I have had in getting this amendment enacted into law. There appear to be some Members of Congress who firmly believe that domestic violence is the fault of the woman.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise join the Washington World Affairs Council in congratulating Ambassador Booth Gardner on his selection as the 1997 recipient of the World Citizen Award. 
The World Affairs Council is a 1,200 member nonprofit organization of business and community leaders with more than 40 years of experience bringing the world to Washington State. From the widely popular Public Programs, which includes the annual lecture series to the nationally recognized International Visitors Program, the World Affairs Council has been an instrumental force in bringing together varied and diverse cultures as well as exposing Washington State to changing political environments around the globe and the importance of international trade. 
Booth Gardner was first elected to public office in 1972 where he served 3 years as a State senator followed by election as Pierce County Executive in 1980. In 1984, Booth Gardner realized his boyhood dream with his election to Washington's governorship. A widely popular Governor, Booth was re-elected to a second term in 1988. 
As Governor of the most trade dependant State in the Nation, Governor Gardner was exposed on numerous occasions to the importance of international cooperation and negotiation. Trade missions to Europe and Asia allowed Governor Gardner to boost Washington's ties abroad creating new business, cultural, and educational opportunities. 
After completing his second term, Governor Gardner was appointed by the newly elected President Clinton to become the first U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization. Assuming the much deserved title of Ambassador, Booth Gardner played a major role in shaping this important organization and particularly representing U.S. interests. Throughout his service to the WTO, he carefully balanced the needs of the United States with the goals of multilateral cooperation. Ambassador Gardner set the standard for U.S. participation at the WTO. 
Congratulations Ambassador Booth Gardner. Your public service from Washington State to capital cities throughout the world makes all of Washington very proud.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join a number of my colleagues in speaking briefly about one of the most important issues that will come before the Senate next year in the second session of the 105th Congress. 
In late September, President Clinton submitted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the Senate for ratification. The President's transmission statement includes the following: 
The Conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is a signal event in the history of arms control. The subject of the treaty is one that has been under consideration by the international community for nearly 40 years, and the significance of the conclusion of negotiations and the signature to date of more than 140 states cannot be overestimated. The Treaty creates an absolute prohibition against the conduct of nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosion anywhere. . . . The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is of singular significance to the continuing efforts to stem nuclear proliferation and strengthen regional and global stability. Its conclusion marks the achievement of the highest priority item on the international arms control and nonproliferation agenda. 
I commend the President for his leadership on this issue. I look forward to working closely and in a bipartisan fashion to secure prompt ratification of the CTBT. I will do absolutely everything I can to support the passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I expect a spirited debate on the CTBT including vigorous opposition from some who continue to believe in nuclear expansion and experimentation. 
Several Senate hearings have recently been held and I urge the body to move forward in a timely and deliberative manner early in 1998. As a member of the Appropriations Energy and Water subcommittee with funding responsibility for nuclear weapons activities including stockpile stewardship, I look forward to actively participating in Senate consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on October 31, 1997 Washington state Governor Gary Locke declared the month of October `Bernie Whitebear Month' and proclaimed Bernie Whitebear as a `Citizen of the Decade'. I would like to join the Governor, and the whole state of Washington in paying tribute to Bernie Whitebear for his outstanding contributions to the Seattle metropolitan community, the urban Native American community, the state of Washington, and in fact the entire Pacific Northwest. 
For 30 years, Bernie Whitebear has been a voice and representative of the needs and concerns of the urban Indian community in Seattle and surrounding areas. His commitment to the preservation and edification of Native American culture within a diverse urban environment has never wavered. He established the Minority Executive Director's Coalition of King County, participates in the Northwest Asian American Theater's annual community Show-Off, and through his United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, acts as the Executive Director of the Daybreak Star Cultural and Education Center in Discovery Park, a center he established. 
In recent years, Bernie has been tireless in his pursuit of his next vision: the People's Lodge. The People's Lodge is the next phase of development for the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation (United Indians) Indian Cultural Center (ICC) which includes the Daybreak Star Center. The United Indians is a well-established organization thanks to Bernie with over 20 years of service in Western Washington. The ICC mission, and Bernie's focus in life, is to improve the social, economic, and cultural well-being of Native Americans living in the metropolitan Seattle area. Bernie and United Indians run a variety of educational, community service, and cultural arts programs serving 4,000 clients and attracting 30,000 visitors a year. The People's Lodge will improve and expand United Indian's desire to preserve and enhance Indian heritage and educate people about Indian cultural diversity. The People's Lodge will include a permanent Hall of Ancestors exhibition, a multiple-use Potlatch House, and an exhibition gallery, the John Kauffman, Jr. Theater, a resource center, and the Sacred Circle of the American Indian Art. 
The programs and activities envisioned by Bernie in the People's Lodge will be a great benefit to the greater Seattle community and the citizen's of Western Washington. The People's Lodge will create new jobs, serve as a new venue for sales and performances by artists of all kinds, and help preserve and advance the cultural heritage of Native Americans in this region. It has been my pleasure to work with Bernie in seeking federal support of this project. Bernie has been working diligently to secure an Economic Development Administration grant for the People's Lodge. I urge the EDA to give the grant proposal of United Indians for the People's Lodge their utmost consideration. 
Bernie Whitebear is a true leader for Native Americans in Seattle and a genuine asset to our community in the greater Seattle area. I personally appreciate his efforts. It is always a pleasure to see Bernie's warm face and bright smile come into my office. Bernie truly is a Citizen of the Decade.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Gorton and I have been working with the Puyallup Tribe of Washington to establish base funding in the BIA budget for the Medicine Creek Tribal Community College in Tacoma, WA. The Tribe has been working diligently and patiently with the BIA to secure the necessary accreditation to facilitate such base funding. I am happy to report that the tribe has just recently received such accreditation. 
However, the BIA has recently denied the Puyallup request for funding on the grounds that they had not established their accreditation, even though that was not a requirement of the BIA rules when the initial request for funding was made. On April 8, 1997, I wrote the BIA to express my concern regarding an apparent accreditation `catch-22'. It seemed that in order to be accredited, the school needed to demonstrate a secure funding base. However, to secure a funding base the college needed to be accredited. I expressed to the BIA my sincere desire to see this apparent conundrum resolved. Over the past several months, it appeared that the BIA was, in fact, moving to address this issue. In a recent meeting the tribe had with Michael Anderson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, they were assured they would receive funding for fiscal year 1998. But we now understand that the BIA has changed its mind and indicated that Medicine Creek Tribal College will not receive funding for fiscal year 1998. This is not acceptable. 
In the conference report on H.R. 2107, the conferees agreed to increase funding for tribally controlled community colleges by $2,500,000 over the fiscal year 1997 level. Is it the intention of the chairman of the subcommittee that the Medicine Creek Tribal College be eligible for some of this funding?

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank my many colleagues, who on such short notice, agreed to cosponsor and enact this resolution establishing November 6, 1997, as National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence Day. I know the many volunteers and organizations working to protect our children also offer their thanks. 
Today, Halloween, is a perfect day to reaffirm our national commitment to stopping youth violence. On this night, children across America will be going trick or treating dressed in all sorts of wonderful costumes. They will enjoy seeing each other, visiting their neighbors, and--best of all--getting mountains of sweets. 
But in many cities, parents will keep their children inside. There will be no trick or treating because the streets are too dangerous for children. There might be block parties, but there won't be the fun and freedom that comes from frolicking through the streets in search of the good treats. All of us recognize the importance of making our streets and communities safe for children. 
One person, Mary Lewis Grow, thought something we might do to make our young people safer was to establish a national Day of Concern. So, this Minnesota homemaker, in 1996, persuaded Senators Wellstone, Specter, and Bradley to introduce this resolution. Other groups, such as Mothers Against Violence in America, joined her effort. The proclamation of a special day of recognition also provided support to a national effort to encourage students to sign a pledge against gun violence. In 1996, 32,000 students in Washington State signed the pledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York City, and tens of thousands more across the Nation. 
The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls for a national observance on November 6 to give students throughout America the chance to make a promise, in writing, that they will do their part to prevent gun violence. The students' pledge promises three things: first, they will never carry a gun to school; second, they will never resolve a dispute with a gun; and third, they will use their influence with friends to discourage them from resolving disputes with guns. 
Mr. President, just last week I joined several colleagues on the floor of the Senate as we decried the murder of Ann Harris, a 17-year-old Virginian, by a 19-year-old man in Washington State. This random act of violence was apparently precipitated because the car in which Ann was a passenger was going too slowly for the driver of the car in which the murderer was riding. The young man was angry enough and morally numbed enough to fire his gun into Ann's car, killing Ann. What a tragedy. What a waste. 
In another example, a 14-year-old boy opened fire in a Moses Lake, WA, classroom, killing a teacher and student and wounding others. He has been convicted, but that does little to ease the pain of the loss suffered by that small community. Maybe if he had signed a pledge, maybe if he had heard the message over and over from parents and friends that gun violence was the wrong way to solve problems, maybe if, maybe if. We don't know how we might have stopped this act of violence, but we know we all have to try education, try outreach, try everything. 
Mr. President, we need to help all of our kids feel a part of this society. Yet often we overlook the young people themselves when trying to develop solutions. Students and other young leaders represent the great untapped resource for improving our communities. As many teachers and police officers have told me, `if a young person doesn't succeed anywhere else, they can always find success in a gang.' We need to make sure they have more productive options. The road to creating these options, and to healing our communities, starts with the young people themselves. 
Young people increasingly grow tired of getting all of the blame for crime in our neighborhoods, and none of the responsibility for solutions. If you ask young people what they think will make a difference for them, you'll find them to be highly creative. Many times their solutions work far better than solutions put forward by adults. 
Young people in my State and across the country don't like school uniform requirements, curfews, and other policies enacted for young people. Young people with the Seattle Youth Involvement Network decided to do something about it. They opened a dialog with the police department. They shared perspectives. They looked across the lines that separated their cultures. They spoke about ways police see and speak with young people and vice versa. And they found solutions to many problems facing them both. 
For more than a year now, I've been in a dialog with young people from all over the State of Washington who have joined the Senate Advisory Youth Involvement Team I established. They advise me on issues affecting them, and I help them with local community action. Crime, and how to prevent it, is a large concern with the young people I talk with, whether they are in gifted programs or youth offender programs. 
This resolution today should be seen as an invitation for young people across the country to tell us what they think about how to solve the problems of crime and gun violence. It should be displayed in every school, community center, and on every street corner in America. 
Mr. President, let us work with our kids to show them we care. And with our communities to give these young people other options to violence. I again affirm my commitment to work with our young people to let them know we care about them and to help them learn gun violence is not the answer to any problem.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the legislation before the Senate, along with the chairman, Senator Burns, who has done an outstanding job of putting this legislation together. I hope the Senate does disapprove the cancellation of projects which the President made under his line-item veto authority. I do not think it was appropriate to exercise that authority in the case of our bill. The subcommittee worked very hard and successfully to review the many requests that came before us for projects that were not included in the President's budget. We worked very hard to include only those which met very stringent criteria. In all cases, that included the criteria that the project be executable in fiscal year 1998. That is, that contracts could be awarded for construction. 
It is puzzling to me why the administration concluded that some 38 projects were not executable. That conclusion is wrong. The Pentagon's own paperwork, provided to the subcommittee for each of the proposed projects, plainly states virtually every project we included was capable of execution in fiscal year 1998. 
The subcommittee added substantial sums for new health facilities, quality of life improvements such as the housing area, and for the National Guard and the Reserves. Despite these additions, the final product was frugal, and represented a 6-percent reduction below last year's milcon spending level. 
Mr. President, the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senators Stevens and Byrd, have rejected the vetoed items as an inappropriate overreaching of authority on the part of the administration. I am gratified that the committee is standing up for the subcommittee's work. It is a substantially better product than the budget submitted by the President, and that is our job. The administration has no exclusive corner on wisdom in making its selection of projects. 
In fact, the administration has admitted making serious errors in the handling of this matter. I would have thought that the administration would have been far more careful and selective in exercising its new line-item authority, but the reverse was the case. The exercise of power here was sloppy, and rushed--and resulted, as OMB Director Raines wrote to the committee on October 23, in inaccuracies. The administration has taken to writing to individual Senators to indicate it would help restore those projects wrongly vetoed, and put them back in the budget at the earliest opportunity. That tactic makes the situation, if anything, even more confused, since it appears the administration is revising its evaluation of the mix of projects based on new information or criteria and there has certainly been no meeting of the minds on such new acceptable criteria with the committee. 
Mr. President, I would suggest that Senators look at this disapproval resolution in the narrow framework in which it is written. Senators need not address this position on the constitutionality or wisdom of the line-item veto legislation itself to vote for this resolution. A vote for this resolution is a vote against back-of-the-hand capriciousness, apparently in a hurried manner, after the subcommittee, full committee, and both Houses labored over a period of several months to scrub the budget and add only those projects which are deemed worthy. 
I hope this measure will receive the strong support of the full Senate, as it did when the conference report was first presented, and that it will be presented to the President before we conclude the first session of this Congress. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the conference report (105-252) on Department of Agriculture appropriations includes $34.4 million for resource conservation and development [RC&D]. The conferees note that this increase in funding is not specifically earmarked for any initiative but should be used for approved RC&D Councils waiting for funding. I agree that the Natural Resource Conservation Service [NRCS] should prioritize funding for newly approved RC&D Councils. These councils provide much needed assistance to watersheds and conservation districts seeking to maximize the environmental benefits of their conservation programs. RC&D Councils should be funded. RC&D is a very important program for protection and prudent development of our Nation's natural resource base. Working through local RC&D Councils, this program helps enhance our ability to meet economic objectives within the context of a wise and sustainable use of our natural resources. In Washington State, a State rich in natural resources, RC&D offers the chance to meet the challenges of threatened resources in the face of demands for continued economic development.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution proclaiming November 6, 1997, as National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence Day. Last year, Senators Wellstone, Specter, and Bradley introduced this resolution. I am joined by Senator Kempthorne and many other colleagues today in supporting an identical resolution. We have all seen the good that can come from focusing attention on young people and helping organizations across the country mobilize children to stay away from gun violence. 
The Day of Concern was initiated by Mary Lewis Grow, a Minnesota homemaker, in 1996. Other groups, such as Mothers Against Violence in America, have joined her effort to establish a Day of Concern. The proclamation of a special day of recognition also provided support to a national effort to encourage students to sign a pledge against gun violence. In 1996, 32,000 students in Washington State signed the pledge card, as did more than 200,000 children in New York City, and tens of thousands more across the nation. 
The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence calls for a national observance on November 6 to give students throughout America the chance to make a promise, in writing, that they will do their part to prevent gun violence. The students' pledge promises three things: first, they will never carry a gun to school; second, they will never resolve a dispute with a gun; and third, they will use their influence with friends to discourage them from resolving disputes with guns. 
Mr. President, just last week I joined several colleagues on the floor of the Senate as we decried the murder of Ann Harris, a 17-year-old Virginian, by a 19-year-old man in Washington State. This random act of violence was apparently precipitated because the car in which Ann was a passenger was going too slowly for the driver of the car in which the murderer was riding. The young man was angry enough and morally numbed enough to fire his gun into Ann's car, killing Ann. What a tragedy. What a waste. 
In another example, a 14-year-old boy opened fire in a Moses Lake, WA classroom, killing a teacher and student and wounding others. He has been convicted, but that does little to ease the pain of the loss suffered by that small community. Maybe if he had signed a pledge, maybe if he had heard the message over and over from parents and friends that gun violence was the wrong way to solve problems, maybe if * * * maybe if * * *. We don't know how we might have stopped this act of violence, but we know we all have to try education, try outreach, try everything. 
We all have been heartened by statistics showing crime in America on the decline. A number of factors are involved, including community-based policing, stiffer sentences for those convicted, youth crime prevention programs, and population demographics. I don't think any of us intend to rest on our successes. Rather, we must review programs that work, and focus our limited resources on those. Legislation passed earlier this year, the Safe and Drug Free Communities Act, will help us do that. 
Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join in this simple effort to focus attention on gun violence among youth by proclaiming November 6, a `Day of Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.' This is an easy step for us to help facilitate the work that must go on in each community across America, as parents, teachers, friends, and students try to prevent gun violence before it continues to ruin countless lives.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is a personal pleasure and an honor for me to be here this afternoon as one of Washington's U.S. Senators. My State--my entire State--is immensely proud today as Tom Foley's nomination to be our Ambassador to Japan comes to the Senate floor. 
Most of my Senate colleagues know Tom Foley personally as a result of working with him on legislation and on maintaining the integrity and authority of the legislative branch. 
Important for those of us in the Senate, the man who eventually became Speaker began his congressional career in the U.S. Senate as special counsel to the late and revered Washington State Senator Henry M. `Scoop' Jackson. Despite his distinguished service in the other body, Tom Foley is really one of our own. 
Tom was born and raised in Spokane, WA. The son of Superior Court Judge Ralph and Helen Foley, he is the descendent of a pioneering family that settled in Washington's big bend country. He also learned firsthand the importance of public service from his father, Judge Foley. In addition, he learned firsthand about the crop that has become one of our most successful export commodities, wheat, by working in his uncle's grain elevator business. 
It was that early introduction to the export dominated economy of our State that led to his unstinting advocacy of American agricultural exports to Japan, most of Asia, and throughout the world. 
Throughout his long service as a Washington State Representative to Congress and as its Speaker, he was a tireless advocate for American competitiveness in the world market and for its peerless agricultural productivity. As a champion of America's family farmers throughout his service as a member and then chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, he took every opportunity to press, usually successfully, the opening of markets throughout the world to the production of America's farmers. 
But Speaker Foley always understood that America's national interest would be best served by ensuring that all of its products would have a level playing field with all our trading partners. It is my belief that the reason Speaker Foley enjoys such great respect in Japan today is his consistent and candid portrayal of critical issues that have arisen between this country and Japan. The Japanese, like many of my Senate colleagues who have served here longer than I, also know him as a skilled and tireless negotiator. 
In my opinion, no recent Member of Congress surpasses Speaker Foley in the depth and breadth of his understanding of Japan. It is no exaggeration to say that during the more than 25 years he has traveled regularly to Japan, he has made the acquaintance of virtually every single political and economic leader of note in that country. On those trips, and the many occasions when he received Japanese political and business leaders in this country, he pressed the full range of American trade and vital mutual security concerns. Throughout this period, Speaker Foley also provided counsel and sage advice to Presidents of both parties. 
This record of understanding, great knowledge, and policy expertise is unparalleled in either Tokyo or Washington. It makes Speaker Foley the natural choice to be our Ambassador to Japan, representing our Nation, its people, and its vital interests. The residents of my State are so proud of Tom Foley's record of public service. 
Mr. President, I believe it is time once again, to draw from the illustrious alumni ranks of the Senate to fill what is perhaps our most important diplomatic post as we did when we sent Majority Leader Mansfield and Vice President Walter Mondale to Tokyo. 
Tom Foley will be a fabulous ambassador. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this nomination.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I stand with my colleagues from Idaho today out of anger, sadness, and commitment. A beautiful young woman, Ann Harris, was murdered in my State of Washington. She was murdered by a young man in a random act of violence as she rode in a car with her friends through a Tacoma neighborhood. 
Her death is an outrage. We all should be furious. But the saddest comment is that to so many young people, Ann is simply another statistic. To too many she's just `another homicide.' A 17-year-old girl is murdered by a young college football player. Our eyes just glaze at the headline and move on. 
This time, her parents, her friends, my colleagues and I, and many individuals and organizations across America are not going to let her murder be only a small blip on the television screen. We will not forget her--or any of the other hundreds of children and young people murdered each year. 
Her parents, Coleman and Jean, have organized `Ann's Campaign for a Safer America.' Even in their tragic loss and profound grief, they pledged to themselves and their lost daughter that they would work to stop violence and stop our national indifference to it. Ann's Campaign's focus will be to encourage, motivate, educate, and help youth and adults alike to live the life Ann radiated--a life that said every day and in every way: smile more, care more, love more, and be more understanding. They will help us all focus on the good and learn to stop violence. 
Mr. President, this is not about guns. This is about an attitude among too many young people `on the street' that violence is an acceptable alternative. We adults, we Members of Congress, must send the message to our kids and young adults that when someone is killed it will not pass by unnoticed. As adults we must let them know killing and maiming is appalling--and totally unacceptable. 
To too many of them it is a quick news piece and it's gone. To too many of them it is `just another funeral.' But to parents and family and friends it is a light gone out, a hope not realized, a life not fulfilled. 
 Mr. President, there is hope that we can make a change in the apathy of our young people. In addition to Ann's parents, a friend of mine from Mercer Island, Pam Eakes, formed an organization called Mothers Against Violence in America. 
After hearing about one too many children who lost their lives to violence, she resolved to make a difference, to make kids think about their actions, to teach them empathy, to teach them nonviolence. 
Mothers Against Violence also supports families of victims. There is nothing worse than a parent's loss of a child. They feel helpless, and often guilty, like they somehow are to blame for not giving their child full protection from all danger. They are innocent victims, too, and desperately need the support that only others who have suffered their loss can give. 
I want to again offer my sincere condolences to Ann's parents. They are so brave to wage this war against apathy and indifference and for love and caring and understanding. Every time they discuss these issues, their own wounds are opened. I thank them and I thank Pam Eakes and a member of my staff, Mary Glenn, and all of the mothers and fathers who have taken their grief and have woven it into a mission to change the world. 
Mr. President, they cannot fight alone. We all must get involved and teach our children--and each other--that violence is unacceptable. We can make a difference by joining organizations like Mothers Against Violence or Ann's Campaign and working with them to teach and support. And we can start organizations across America to save our children from violence. 
Young people can no longer believe that an angry action of one moment is only that. It is not just an action. It is murder. It is wrong and it will be punished. It is time to stop the violence. 
I know that I will continue my personal fight against violence in America. And I urge all of our colleagues to join us in this campaign. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this morning the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] presented the 1997 Walter B. Jones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards for Coastal and Ocean Resource Management. A number of distinguished citizens, students, and public servants were honored for their commitment to the protection, conservation, and sustainable use of our Nation's precious coastal resources. I would like to offer my praise and admiration to all of the award recipients for their hard work and dedication to this critical area of ecological and economic concern. 
Over one-half of the U.S. population resides within 50 miles of the coast. All of these people and the associated development and other activities that accompany them place extraordinary pressure on the ecosystems, watersheds, and communities on our coasts. Coastal areas provide incredible commercial, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to the American people. The Walter B. Jones and NOAA awards recognize individuals who have taken on the challenge of protecting these coastal areas and ensuring these benefits are not lost. 
While I congratulate all of the award recipients, I would like to acknowledge two Washington State recipients in particular. Recipients of the Excellence in Coastal and Marine Graduate Study Award, Lillian Ferguson and John Field, from the University of Washington School of Marine Affairs. I am honored to have these two bright graduate students represent Washington State and our commitment to the protection of coastal areas. 
Lillian Ferguson's works focuses on management of maritime transportation and marine protected areas. As a summer intern (1996) for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary [OCNMS] she developed a program for documentation and analysis of vessel traffic in the congested entrance and approaches to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Her work formed the basis for recent implementation of the program by the OCNMS this year. This prototype program may be suitable for adoption in many similar situations in the United States and abroad. During the academic year 1996-97, Lillian is the Project Assistant for the Safe Marine Transportation Forum [SMART Forum]. In this capacity she promotes dialogue among more than 20 stakeholder interests on marine safety and transportation on Puget Sound. Lillian has also contributed as a research assistant to the National Coastal Zone Management Effectiveness Study recently completed for OCRM/NOAA. Her thesis work analyzes the development of interjurisditional collaboration in managing marine environments between the NMS Program and the U.S. National Park Service. Lillian has made significant contributions with the work she has already completed. Her thesis should be quite informative and valuable in improving interjurisdictional cooperation between the NMS Program and other Federal and State entities. 
John Field's work focuses on the initial impacts of regional climate change. For approximately 2 years John has been a Research Assistant in the Integrated Regional Assessment Program for the Pacific Northwest sponsored by NOAA through the Joint Institute for Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean [JISAO, Principal Investigator Ed Miles]. His role and responsibilities have been especially difficult to perform given the scant attention to systematic monitoring of coastal impacts. John has done a superb job of combining disparate data sets, anecdotal information, and informed experience to document key issues and trends relevant to projected Global Climate Change scenarios. His efforts form the stage on which interdisciplinary team-based integration can take place. John coauthored with Marc Hershman a report on this work and is currently completing his thesis documenting and expanding somewhat on the findings. This research should assist the development of coastal impact scenarios under regional climate change assessments elsewhere. Besides this work John has been the coordinator for a very successful joint seminar between the School of Marine Affairs and the fishing industry. In addition, John has been working during the summer on a seabed coring project led by Prof. Robert Francis to obtain Paleo-records of fish and shellfish abundance in the North Pacific. 
Both of these award recipients have worked hard for the sake of our coastal resources in Washington State. As they move on from graduate work and enter the work force either in public service, nongovernmental organizations, or private industry, I know they will continue in their commitment to the protection, conservation, and sustainable use of our coastal resources. With students such as Lillian and John in our graduate schools, I am confident about the future of our coastal areas as the challenges confronting these areas and those of us who care about them become increasingly complex. And to Lillian and John, congratulations.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank the subcommittee for its hard and diligent work on this bill. In particular, I appreciate the recognition of the Coordinated Tribal Water Quality Program in Washington State [CTWQP]. 
The CTWQP is a most important model for demonstrating how tribes can solve their water quality protection problems by coordinating with local, State, and Federal Government agencies. This program began in 1990 when the 26 tribes and tribal organizations in Washington State came together with a cooperative intergovernmental strategy to accomplish national clean water goals and objectives. As a result of Federal court decisions, the State of Washington has recognized the tribes as comanagers of water quality in the State. This program has been an effective tool for leveraging scarce public funds to create viable, watershed-based water quality protection plans. 
It is my understanding Congress has increased EPA's General Assistance Program [GAP] and other funding mechanisms over the years which includes the base program efforts for the CTWQP in Washington State.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is the 5th year I have been a Member of the U.S. Senate. And this is the 5th year I can recall debating campaign finance reform. I have voted for campaign reform legislation several times now, and each time it has been killed off by filibuster. 
This year, I have served as a member of the Leadership Task Force on Campaign Reform. We knew from the beginning of the year this would be a big issue. Therefore, we have devoted hours to finding a way to break the logjam and move a bill. 
Against this backdrop, I have been listening to this debate very closely over the past few days. I have been watching the hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I have been watching the efforts of colleagues on the other side of the aisle as they attempt to find a compromise. 
So far, I cannot see many differences between this debate, and the ones we've had over the past few years. In this debate, we have a bipartisan group of Senators committed to reform. This group has worked overtime to craft a reasonable reform measure that makes sense for America. They have worked to generate support, to make their case to the media and to the public, and to push for the last few votes necessary to pass it. I have been proud to support the effort. 
And, like usual, there is the familiar obstruction on the other side of the aisle: a concerted effort to preserve the status quo. Though carefully disguised, their goal is to prevent reform legislation from passing. 
There is a big difference this time. The public is paying more attention than ever before. The excesses of the last campaign season, brought to light through the good work of the Governmental Affairs Committee, have made campaign reform a front-burner issue in every kitchen in America. Just yesterday, more than 1 million signatures were delivered to the Capitol. These are signatures from people all over America who, over the past 7 months, have joined a nationwide call for reform. 
The people are calling for reform, as they have for years. But this time the call is louder, the focus is more intense, and the opponents of reform will be held accountable. 
What exactly is the problem? Money, plain and simple. Too much money, having too much influence over our democratic process. As I have said before, this Congress has reached the point where votes and decisions have become a bidding war between well funded special interests. 
When the Senate debates a bill, we are no longer simply 100 Senators representing our States. We are 100 Senators representing our States and every special interest who has ever made a major financial contribution to the party, or to the campaign, in order to influence government decisionmaking. This is wrong. This is not the way it should be. 
The campaign system is clogged with money, and there is no room left for the average voter. Political campaigning has become an industry in this country. In last election, over $800 million were spent on Federal elections alone. To what end? To perpetuate the status quo. Just think what $800 million could do if spent on charitable pursuits. 
Instead, that money--much of it undisclosed, from dubious sources--flowed into the political arena and dictated the terms of our elections to the people. Like water, it flowed downhill into campaigns all across the country. Some of it came out in the form of national party ads attacking candidates in the abstract; some came out in the form of issue-ads by interest groups trying to influence the outcomes. Some of it came out in the candidates own TV ads. 
It reaches the point where you almost cannot hear the voices of the candidates anymore, only the voices of the dueling special interests. We do not know who pays for these ads, where they get their money, or what they stand to gain if their candidate wins. Yet they have found ways to have a huge influence over the election process. 
On the other side of the aisle, the opponents of reform argue against the McCain-Feingold bill on free speech grounds. They wrap themselves in the flag and posture as protectors of free speech. Then they argue politicians and political parties should be able to take money in any amount from anyone in order to make the case for their reelection. They believe that having more money entitles one to a greater influence over our campaigns and elections. I find this argument shocking, Mr. President. I find it profoundly un-democratic, and un-American. 
In hiding behind a transparent argument about free speech based on access to money, the opponents of reform conveniently gloss over reality: our campaign system is so awash in money, that the voices of average people and average voters are completely drowned out. Ultimately, people are losing faith in their elected officials and their government. It is simply not a healthy situation for our country. 
Mr. President, the opponents of reform miss the point. In America, money does not equal speech. More money does not entitle one to more speech. The haves are not entitled to a greater voice in politics than the have-nots. In America, everyone has an equal say in our government. That is why our Declaration of Independence starts with, `We, the people.' 
The last time we debated reform, I told a story of a woman who sent my campaign a small contribution of $15. With her check she enclosed a note that said, `please make sure my voice means as much as those who give thousands.' With all due respect, Mr. President, this woman is typical of the people who deserve our best representation. Sadly, under the current campaign system, they rarely do. 
I have tried to live by my word on this issue. My first Senate campaign was a shoestring affair. I was out spent nearly 3 to 1 by a congressional incumbent. But because I had a strong, grassroots, people-based effort, I was able to win. 
Since then, I have worked hard to keep to that standard. I have over 20,000 individual donors. The average contribution to my campaign is $42. Over 90 percent of my contributions come from within Washington State. I firmly believe that's the way campaigns should be run: by the people. 
We need more disclosure, not less. We need more restrictions on special interest money, not fewer. We need less money in the system, not more. We need to amplify the voices of regular people, instead of allowing them to be shouted down by special interests. 
Mr. President, I believe we have made this debate way too complicated. After all the maneuvering, the cloture petitions, the technicalities, the procedural votes, this issue boils down to one basic question: are Senators willing to make some modest reforms to reduce the influence of big money in politics and encourage greater voter participation? Or are they more interested in protecting the current system, and the ability of parties and politicians to turn financial advantage into political advantage? 
Are you for reform, or against it? Are you with the people, or against them on the need for a more healthy democracy? The votes we are taking today will show the answers to these questions.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern about one provision within the bill before us today. The fiscal year 1998 Treasury-Postal Appropriations Act contains a cost-of-living adjustment--a pay raise--for Members of Congress. This increase represents a major change in policy. It has not been the subject of hearings. It has not been aired in public. The timing and merit are questionable. In light of these concerns, I intend to vote no on the pay raise, and no on the bill. 
Each year I have been in the Senate, we have acted to suspend cost-of-living adjustments for Congress. In light of our ongoing efforts to balance the Federal budget and restore people's faith in the process, I think this has been the right course. Simply stated, allowing our own pay to increase sends the wrong signal at a time when the budget is out of balance and real wages are stagnant for many workers. 
Like it or not, we in Federal office have a responsibility to set an example, to set the tone for responsible dialog about the Federal budget. Accepting a pay raise at this time undermines any credibility we might have on budget issues. 
In July, Congress passed a historic law that will balance the Federal budget. After years of partisan rancor, bickering, disputes, and Government shut-downs, we were able to put aside differences and agree on a compromise that makes sense, and gives the people what they have been asking for. 
Now, most of us who worked on this package, and made the tough calls over the past few years understandably want to promote the compromise and take credit for finishing the job. And I think we should. But taking a pay raise on the heels of passing a balanced budget sends the wrong signal. It says to the people, `we didn't really mean it.' 
As a member of the Appropriations Committee, it is very difficult for me to vote against the Treasury-Postal bill. In fact, it is rare that any of us on the committee opposes one of our own bills. In this case, I have to make an exception, even though there are many worthy programs and projects funded in this bill. 
I hope my colleagues will hear my reasons and listen to them. As elected leaders, we are held to a different standard. We have a responsibility to set the tone, to earn the respect of our constituents. The public will be watching this vote. To them, it is not about funding the executive branch agencies. Instead, it is about whether we are willing to live up to our own standard of fiscal responsibility in 1997.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Jonathan Cameron Boster, a fallen firefighter who gave his life in service to his community. While nearly 100 fire service personnel nationwide sacrifice their lives every year, Jon's death is even more poignant because he was just 19 years old. 
At 10 p.m. on April 8, 1996, Grant County Fire District 5 was responding to a structure fire in Moses Lake, WA. The water tanker Jon was driving rolled off a curved rural road, killing him and injuring one other firefighter. Jon's comrades could not turn back because of their commitment to the community. They did what Jon would have done; they fought the fire. 
Jon was a fun-loving young man with bright eyes and a charming smile. A Montana State all-star basketball player in high school, Jon also played football and ran track. He enjoyed water and snow skiing, fishing and hunting. Jon delighted in his niece and nephew and his greatest joy was playing with them. 
His driving desire, however, was firefighting and his world revolved around his ambition. He was a resident firefighter and E.M.S. provider and a State-certified first responder and defibrillator technician. He planned to attend the Washington State Fire Academy. 
Each October, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation holds a memorial in tribute to the firefighters who died the previous year. On October 5, 1997, Jon will be honored and a plaque listing his name and the names of each fallen firefighter will be unveiled and dedicated. 
Every fallen firefighter is a hero, and each death a loss to an entire community. While Jon's death is sorrowful, we can take comfort in knowing that Jon gave his life in pursuit of his goal, racing not just to a fire, but toward a dream.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today we debate an amendment to the fiscal year 1998 District of Columbia Appropriations Act that would provide publicly-funded vouchers to low-income students so they can attend private and religious schools in the District and surrounding areas. 
The bill would authorize $7 million in the first year and a total of $45 million over 5 years. My colleagues have pointed out that this $7 million would only serve 3 percent of the students in the Washington, DC school district, and that we should instead be looking at investments that will help 100 percent of the students. 
How much would $7 million buy for all the students in Washington, DC schools? How much real help--that would improve their ability to learn and succeed? 
How many teachers, reading assistants, school counselors, nurses, or volunteer coordinators would $7 million buy? How many computers, video systems, wireless communications systems, computer-assisted drafting systems, technology labs and other tools could $7 million buy? How many different ways could we help the parents--through parent involvement programs or family literacy services--to help their children succeed in school, with $7 million? 
My colleagues have in this debate asserted or intimated that defense of the public school is essentially defending the status quo, and being afraid of change. Well, when it comes to using public school funds to pay for students to attend private, sectarian schools, the status quo is actually set in the U.S. and many State constitutions. 
Our country has a rich history, since Roger Williams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, that keeps a line of separation between our public tax dollars and the checking account at the local house of worship. These debates are further informed by public votes and public polls. As far as the American public is concerned, this particular ground has been gone over. The argument is moot; the law is clear. 
The experiences of the State of Washington also have bearing on this issue. I stand before you as a former school board member from a State where the law allows school boards to change anything not otherwise prohibited by law--to help students learn. 
Washington State allows wide flexibility in carrying out existing school law--and the Washington State Legislature has held many open public debates on laws that seem too stifling. In every school in my State, like those in many other States, there are teachers, students, parents, and community members thinking about how to make schools better, and taking actions to make them better. 
I want to be very clear about this--fear of change is not the obstacle here. My State also has a public school choice law that allows any student to attend school in any public school they choose. One thing we ve learned from this Washington State law is that the biggest frustration occurs when a school determines, as it is allowed, to say when the school is full, and closes the door to new students--who then must choose another school. 
The voters of Washington had a choice last fall, to allow private school vouchers. And they overwhelmingly rejected the idea at the polls. As you have heard, this has happened in other States around the country. 
Today, if you are worried about the educational crisis affecting any student in a public school anywhere in this country --you have two choices. You can play `let's talk about vouchers,' or you can go help a school. You can work at a think tank, or write a column for a newspaper, or become a Member of Congress. 
And you can spend a good portion of your career, countless hours of debate, and millions of dollars breaking your pick in the ground of the school voucher issue. You can impose your will on the only people in the contiguous United States without representative government. You can play games with a community that faces enough challenges already. You can strive to further denigrate the D.C. schools by luring away to private religious schools the 2,000 students who are most likely to want to become leaders in a revitalized public school. 
Or, you can do something productive. This $7 million could do some good. Your time devoted to a public school could help make needed changes. Your fund-raising on behalf of a public school foundation could make the difference for many students. Your tutoring or advocacy on behalf of a student or family could be the symbol that drives much more volunteer time and public awareness. 
It all comes down to one parent wanting to get the very best for his or her son or daughter, and how we can help that parent. We can dangle the possibility of a religious school voucher, or we can help the student and his or her school. For that one student, this $7 million voucher system could be far less meaningful than the help and attention of one caring adult. 
If any nationally-recognized voucher advocate went to that one student's school and offered to mediate a discussion, hold a fund-raiser, or work with a family--that student could find real solutions in a real school. Or, we can continue to talk about vouchers and other things that will not, and in this case, should not happen. 
People have been talking about the crisis in schools for many years. The research shows we are doing better in many areas, but are not living up to the expectations of a new century. I fear that these kinds of discussions just create a crisis of a different kind--a crisis that saps our sense of volunteer spirit and voluntary support of public education. The students deserve better.

Mrs. MURRAY. As a new member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee I have spent the last 8 months coming up to speed on the FDA, reform proposals and the impact of these proposals. I have met with groups representing all sides on these issues--from the biotech industry to groups representing patients. I have tried to keep an open mind and work to find acceptable solutions to the many problems pointed out by industry and the patient groups. There appears to be a general mistrust among all interested parties. As a result each side is concerned about going too far--industry is concerned about burdensome and unnecessary regulation by FDA and the patients are concerned about effective regulation of the industry. It appears that this general mistrust is based on past experiences and each side can give numerous examples. 
My objective was to revitalize the FDA to give it the regulatory flexibility to effectively regulate the pharmaceutical and medical device industry without jeopardizing timely approval of safe and effective lifesaving drugs and devices. At the same time, I am well aware of the prominent public health role played by the FDA--it is after all, a public health agency, not a drug or device manufacturer. My support for real reforms by no means says that I did not support an aggressive public health agency role for the FDA. 
Several weeks ago, I met directly with several biotech companies in the State of Washington. As I sat at the table listening to their concerns I was struck by the amount of experience at the table and level of integrity that many of the companies are known for. I am proud to represent these companies that are on the cutting edge of medical technology and have contributed significantly to improving health care for all Americans. I knew that those companies would not market a dangerous, life threatening drug or device; that none of these companies deliberately act to falsify clinical data or would refuse to complete clinical trials. I knew that these companies were more concerned with getting their lifesaving technologies to patients than simply making a profit. They know the value of one's reputation and are truly proud of the lifesaving work they have done. Sadly, however, not all companies have the same commitment to the patient's health and are allowing stockholders, not scientists, to make decisions. Because of this, I am asking for the Chairman's commitment that the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee will retain a strong and aggressive oversight role. 
We are making some sweeping and some may argue dramatic changes in the way the FDA operates. We need to be sure that these changes are positive and that FDA has the resources and ability to remain an effective public health agency. If we detect future problems or conflicts, I need your commitment and support for swift and thorough hearings. I need to know that we will continue to monitor the FDA, and if legislative revisions are necessary to protect the public health, we will act with great speed. There is probably no other Member more hopeful that some of these reforms will means that patients get access to safe and effective drugs and devices sooner, but I also know that we cannot forget the past. There are certainly many examples of situations where the public health was put into jeopardy by unscrupulous pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. I need your assurances that if problems arise we will act to address any potential threat to the public health.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I filed two amendments to this bill, the intent of which were aimed at what I believe is a serious problem with national uniformity. And that is the issue of poison control labeling to prevent unintentional exposure to dangerous over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics by children. 
During markup of this bill, national uniformity for labeling of over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics was adopted as an amendment. At the time, I raised concerns that I have about the State of Washington's successful Mr. Yuk campaign which simply teaches children and parents about the dangers of many common household products. I was concerned at the time that this program, which I have personal experience with and know how successful it is, would be in jeopardy. 
This is a Mr. Yuk sticker. It is a small green sticker that parents and teachers can put onto products--toxic household products. And kids across my State are taught if they see a Mr. Yuk sticker they don't swallow what is inside of it. 
I was concerned that national uniformity would harm my State's ability to continue this very important program. I raised this point during markup, and I was assured that the objective of the amendment on national uniformity was not to impede a State's ability to protect their children. 
Since the markup, I have become even more concerned about poison control labeling. I am well aware of the fact that Mr. Yuk is voluntary, and there is no State mandate involved. However, this is where I became concerned. Under the uniformity language that is contained in this bill, a State can petition the Secretary for a mandated labeling requirement on OTC's and cosmetics if they meet certain public health and safety standards, and if--and only if--the labeling requirement does not unduly burden interstate commerce. This standard is extremely high and the only way for a State to meet the threshold is for the Secretary to make the requirement a national requirement. 
What does this mean for Mr. Yuk? If New York, based on a local health concern files a petition with the Secretary for a symbol, like a skull and cross bones to be placed on mouthwash or hair coloring, and they make a strong and sound case, the Secretary can be convinced. However, in order to comply with the act and not unduly burden interstate commerce, she must make this a national labeling requirement. Now Washington State faces a situation where they have a Mr. Yuk Program and must also teach about the skull and cross bones warning. 
This would be extremely confusing to young children in my State. I can say that as a former teacher. 
Both of my amendments that I put forward attempted to address this issue. My first amendment would add poison control efforts using symbols in the criteria a State can use to petition the Secretary and change the `and' to an `or' unduly burdening interstate commerce; giving the Secretary the opportunity to continue to allow States to have their own poison control programs if they decide that a voluntary effort has not worked. Only through a mandate requirement will they be able to protect young children. Simply changing the `and' to an `or' would give the Secretary the needed flexibility, and would at least guarantee that one State requirement would not become a national requirement if it was not applicable to all 50 States. 
Mr. President, my amendments have strong opposition by the industry. They simply don't want to have 50 different State legislatures coming forward with 50 different proposals. And I certainly believe there is an argument for preemption in many situations. But I don't believe there is one in this case. 
I am really at a loss as to why supporters of the uniformity language in one breath talk about the need to reform and revitalize the FDA to prevent unnecessary delays in approving drugs and devices and then in the next breath talk about how States must petition an already overburdened agency for the approval to do what they have been doing for years without any public threat of consumer confusion problems. 
It is interesting to note that the managers' amendment does exempt one State from uniformity. Our State is going to be treated differently. One State, the State of California, will be allowed to bypass the petition process and have different health and safety labeling cosmetics. 
Because of the strong opposition to my original amendment and the well-financed national campaign to defeat my amendment, I have revised my language. The new amendment which I am offering today will at least acknowledge the importance of protecting health and safety of children, and will require the FDA to act on a State's petition within 120 days. The new amendment does not address all of my concerns. But because there has been a strong lobby and I am only one Senator that seems to be concerned about poison control, I recognize that my original amendment does not have the votes. But I cannot allow these uniformity provisions to go to conference without some recognition of the health and safety of children. 
So I thank the chairman for working with me. I am pleased that he has recognized my efforts and has supported the pending underlying amendment which has already been agreed to. 
I thank the Chair. I yield my time.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to amend a controversial provision in last year's illegal immigration legislation that threatens to stifle legal travel and commerce between the United States and Canada. 
Section 110 of the 1996 Immigration Reform Act requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop an automated entry and exit system for the purpose of documenting the entry and departure of every alien entering and leaving the United States. The legislation I am introducing today, will amend the illegal immigration legislation to clarify that records of entry and departure are not required for Canadians. This is consistent with long-standing U.S. policy toward Canadian citizens traveling to the United States. 
My constituents are extremely concerned about the onerous implications of section 110. As a frequent visitor to Bellingham and Whatcom County, I hear again and again from the local community about the importance of unimpeded travel between the United States and Canada. I've visited the border crossings at Blaine, WA. At certain times, travel between the United States and Canada is already subject to lengthy delays and traffic back-ups that sometimes exceed 1 mile in length. Section 110 will further complicate border crossings if it is ever instituted on our northern border. 
I have been a long proponent of strengthening and promoting the partnership between Washington State and British Columbia, Canada. British Columbia is a billion dollar neighbor for my State, generating jobs and economic activity important to all of Washington. Canadian tourism and commerce is particularly important to Bellingham and northwest Washington where border trade thrives to the benefit of both Americans and Canadians. 
This legislative initiative follows up on a late 1996 letter I sent to Attorney General Janet Reno inquiring about section 110. The letter expressed my strong opposition to a border fee or other interpretation of section 110 which would inhibit legal tourism and trade between the United States and Canada. I continue to vigorously oppose nuisance measures that will unduly delay legal border crossings. A border tax is the most obvious nuisance measure, however, section 110 if fully implemented will have a potentially disastrous impact on communities in my state. 
I do not expect section 110 to ever be applied to Canadians. To do so, would be a phenomenal waste of limited resources. We can't neglect our northern Border, but we can certainly be a lot smarter. Exempting Canadians from section 110 is the smart thing, the right thing to do. 
I encourage my colleagues to review this important legislation and to join me in supporting the passage of this legislative exemption at the earliest opportunity.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to discuss briefly my amendment to alter U.S. Forest Service rules regarding the export of Western Red Cedar logs from Alaska. Today, because there are no Alaskan sawmills that use this cedar, this National Forest timber is exported as raw logs primarily to foreign customers. 
That is a real problem for our independent mills in Washington and Oregon who have traditionally been dependent on public timber. As we all know--and have discussed in the context of this bill--National Forest timber sales have plummeted since the 1980s. The independent mills that have survived are technologically advanced, with a well-trained workforce, but are always scrambling for reasonably-priced timber. 
As a rule, National Forest timber must be processed before it can be exported overseas. This Congress imposed that policy nearly 20 years ago. There is almost unanimous agreement that federal timber should be processed in America to create the maximum number of American jobs. 
One exception to the rule of domestic processing is that where no market for a certain species of tree exists, the Forest Service will deem that species `surplus.' A surplus species can be exported in as a raw log. 
In Region 10, there are currently no Alaskan processors who can use the Western Red Cedar. The Forest Service has, thus, deemed it surplus. But it is definitely not surplus to the domestic needs of sawmills and workers in the Pacific Northwest. I've been approached by several mills who are desperate for this cedar, including Skookum Lumber in Shelton, WA, and Tubafor Mill, in Morton, WA. 
My amendment requires the Forest Service to offer these national logs at domestic prices to mills in the lower 48 states. It requires the agency to establish a three-tiered policy giving Alaskans first priority, other American companies next priority, and only if no one wants these logs--which is highly unlikely--may they be exported internationally. 
Mr. President, this is a common-sense amendment. Members of the Washington delegation, including Representative Norm Dicks and former Represemtative Jolene Unsoeld, have worked to make this policy change since 1991. Now is the time to use these Federal resources for the benefit of American working families.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, much tribal management of salmon resources in western Washington State is conducted through the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. Historically, the Commission received its funding directly from the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Western Washington--Boldt Implementation and Pacific Salmon Treaty accounts under trust accounts. Beginning five years ago, however, a portion of these monies was re-routed for administrative purposes within the BIA system, passing through the Tribal/Agency Operations, Tribal Priority Allocation line item in the BIA appropriation. This system worked fine for several years, but funding reductions to Tribal/Agency Operations in recent years have resulted in an approximately 13 percent cut to these accounts. Now these funds are being rerouted back to the original line items of Western Washington--Boldt Implementation and Pacific Salmon Treaty in the trust accounts, but at the reduced level. 
Since both the Western Washington--Boldt Implementation and Pacific Salmon Treaty accounts were only included in the Tribal Priority Allocations system for administrative, pass-through purposes, it is inappropriate for these line items to be continued at only the reduced level. Full funding for these accounts should be restored. Congress did not reduce funding for the trust accounts. In addition, Congress has annually adopted the Pacific Salmon Treaty budget as developed by the U.S. Section of the Pacific Salmon Commission, and at no time has this funding been reduced. Also, within the FY-98 funding levels, Tribal Priority Allocations are being restored, but not the Western Washington--Boldt Implementation or Pacific Salmon Treaty funds. These factors provide significant justification for restoring these subject funds in the FY-98 budget. While the trust account budget is now set, the BIA may utilize appropriate funds from another account, such as Tribal Priority Allocations, to fully fund these important programs of the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to strongly support and recommend to the Senate this military construction appropriations conference report. The final amount, $9.18 billion, is slightly below the Senate-passed amount, and is about $800 million above the budget request. Nevertheless, it is a frugal bill, some $600 million, or 6 percent below last year's appropriated amount. 
We have added $800 million to the bill to correct what the subcommittee perceived to be serious shortfalls in quality-of-life initiatives particularly housing and also including child care centers and medical facilities, as well as what has been the annual shortchanging of our guard and reserve forces. In particular, the budget request was for approximately $172 million for our guard and reserve forces, and the conference result was about $460 million, some $290 million over the request. I would point out that the Senate conferees reduced the Senate-passed figure for our guard and reserve forces by over $100 million in order to reach an acceptable compromise with the House. 
In the housing area, the conferees added some $210 million over the requested amount, for a total of $3.9 billion, or 42 percent of the total bill. Even so, the committee ended up approximately $250 million below last year's appropriated amount. 
Furthermore, the committee worked to satisfy the request of Senators on both sides of the aisle for worthy projects that were not included in the request, and I believe we ended up with a very balanced recommendation. 
I do hope that the President will support the bill as passed, and not disturb the balance that we carefully constructed to satisfy the needs of our Nation from coast to coast. 
Mr. President, I would point out to my colleagues that the conference report protected all the design, minor construction, and reporting initiatives that we included in the Senate report, so my colleagues may be assured that those initiatives which were included in the Senate report have been preserved. 
Fully 23 percent of the bill is for the base realignment and closure accounts, and we have included $153 million for NATO initiatives. I would point out, however, that the Senate report includes a requirement for a report on future costs of NATO expansion, as well as a burden-sharing report regarding our initiatives in Southwest Asia. The committee expects these requirements to be taken seriously and to have a full report from the Department of Defense on these matters. 
I am particularly pleased that the conference was able to retain the funding that we included in the Senate-passed bill for new quality-of-life initiatives in Washington, in particular a new library/education center at Fairchild Air Force Base, a barracks replacement at Fort Lewis, health clinics at Fort Lewis and Everett Naval Station, an expansion of an important dining facility and a new child development center at Bremerton Naval Shipyard, and housing at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from Montana, Senator Burns, for the excellent cooperation that he has extended to me throughout this process. I want to thank him for all of his courtesies and for the congenial and cooperative way that his staff, particularly Ms. Ashworth, has extended to all of us. We have enjoyed working with them and all their staff. And I thank Dick D'Amato, from my staff, and Ben McMakin for a job well done. 
I commend this product to the Senate and to the President. I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed the Gorton amendment to the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act. This amendment seeks to block-grant certain Federal education funds and send them directly to school districts across the country. I appreciate my colleague Senator Gorton's intent to pass as much responsibility as possible for making educational and funding decisions to those levels closest to the classroom. This is also a goal of mine. 
However, with all due respect to my colleague, this is one issue where we fundamentally disagree. His amendment, like many ideas, sounds good in theory because it oversimplifies the practical reality in our schools and communities. 
As a former school board member, I agree with my Republican colleagues that our local elected school officials and educators are fully capable of deciding what their local needs and priorities are, and directing funds to those areas. 
But those local school board members and superintendents and principals and educators will tell you that the Federal Government does indeed have a role in education in this country--in setting priorities and assuring equity. 
Despite the occasional difficulties of writing a grant or filling out a form, Federal programs such as School-to-Work, or Safe and Drug-Free Schools, or STAR schools or other Federal technology programs, have made very real differences in the lives of students in schools across this Nation. 
They will tell you that equity protection efforts, such as providing funds for magnet schools, funds for Indian education, or funds for bilingual or migrant education, should continue to be uniquely within the purview of the Federal Government. This is because despite the best intentions, we all know that some school districts in this country have not always been able to do best by all the students all of the time. Equity funds must continue to go to the students and school districts which need them, and must not be watered down and spread across all school districts, regardless of need, as it appears the Gorton amendment would require. 
My problem with the Gorton amendment is that it may cost significantly more to educate one student than another, but this amendment will send them both the same Federal allocation--and ignore the intent of the Federal education program set up to recognize the specific needs associated with the higher cost. 
Every child deserves an effective, relevant education. Not all children have the same opportunity to get it. This amendment will assure that we increase the disparities between the haves and have-nots in our Nation's schools. 
Federal education funds leverage State and local money, as they do in my State, in the area of technology funding. Federal programs include caps on administrative expenditures, and maintenance of effort requirements--so we do not allow States to supplant or misuse funds. Federal education efforts safeguard equity concerns important to the Nation, and set important national goals priorities. 
The Gorton amendment is bad policy. It uses a meat-ax approach to educational reform when what is needed is the precision of a scalpel and a careful ear listening to what local people are really saying. No one likes bureaucracy. Everyone believes our schools can be improved. But educators and tax-payers across the country will grumble more loudly about the potential ill-effects of the Gorton amendment than they ever have over redtape. 
Local control is the goal; the Gorton amendment is fundamentally the wrong way to go about reaching it.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, this amendment that is being offered today by myself, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Landrieu is not unfamiliar to this body. In fact, the U.S. Senate has voted three times on the amendment that is now before us. Three times we have passed this amendment unanimously--once in the welfare bill, once in the budget bill, and once in the budget reconciliation bill. All three times when this amendment was brought before this body, not one Senator spoke against it. It was voted on and passed and sent to conference committee. Without one single voice of opposition and without one single vote of opposition, this amendment was stripped in the conference. Perhaps it is no surprise when you hear the subject of this amendment. It is regarding domestic violence. 
Too often women in our country when it is in the light of day have everyone behind them and support them when it comes to domestic abuse. But these women know where abuse occurs. It occurs behind closed doors when no one is watching. 
This Senate should not approve of that kind of action. This amendment is one that is absolutely vital to the health and welfare of women, their families, and the communities that surround them. The policemen are too often called to situations where a domestic violence incident is occurring, and their lives are then put on the line. 
The amendment that we are offering today does a simple thing. It allows a temporary waiver of the work requirement for a victim of domestic violence in order for them to take care of their medical needs, to change their Social Security number, to take care to make sure that their children are in a safe place and that their family is secure before they are required to be at work. We know that, if a woman is being abused and she is required to be at work, her abuser will often go there to find her or put up barriers so she can't be there. She knows that her life is insecure if her abuser can find her at a workplace where she has to give her Social Security number, where she has to let them know where she is going to be. Where her children are in day care, she can't take care of them to make sure they are safe and secure. 
That is why this humane and compassionate Senate three times has passed this amendment. It is a temporary waiver. We are not asking for a permanent waiver of the work requirements. In fact, we want women who are victims of domestic violence to be at work. Being economically able to take care of themselves is the security they need in order to leave a domestic violence situation. But we want to make sure that they aren't at work with bruises and don't show up at work and are afraid to show up at work with bruises. We want to be sure that their children are in a safe place, if they are victims of domestic violence, before we require them to be at work. We want them to be able to change their Social Security number so they can't be followed before we require them to be at work. Too often these things take months. Changing your Social Security number can often take months. 
We in this Congress don't want to put these women in abusive situations inadvertently. This amendment simply is going to remove a barrier for women so that they can get out of the domestic violence situation. When a woman decides to get out of a situation, she has to know, `Can I have the money? Can I have the ability to take care of my children, to take care of myself?' 
Welfare allows her the ability to get out of that situation, to get herself back on her feet, and to get into the work force, which is exactly what she wants to do so she can be economically secure. 
The way the welfare bill is written today, it does not allow her to do that. 
When we passed this temporary waiver, we said to these women that we would give to States the ability to screen for domestic violence so that they will be allowed to help these women get on their feet and get back into the work force. We did that intelligently here in the Senate. In fact, it passed unanimously in the House as well. But when this amendment got behind closed doors, women were once again abused, and it was stripped from the bill. 
It is absolutely essential that we put this law into the books so that the States across the Nation who are waiting to see what our action is can make sure that women who are abused are taken care of.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, they know what far too often happens to children who are in abusive situations if there are barriers to that woman getting to work. We want to make sure that there are no barriers. The CDF explicitly outlines this in their statement today, and I thank them for their support. 
Mr. President, I have worked on this issue for a number of months--in fact, for a number of years. It has become more critical to me in the last few weeks because of events that happened in my home State. 
About a week ago a young officer in Takoma, WA, was called to a home where a domestic violence situation had occurred. Unfortunately, he was shot and killed. He has a 1-year-old child. He is gone. I heard from many police officers who tell me how risky it is for them to go to homes where domestic violence calls have been placed. We need to make sure that we allow these women to get out of those situations so we don't have the increased numbers that we today have of domestic violence calls. I am amazed at the increased number. In fact, in the Seattle Times just a few days ago was an article, that I will submit in a minute, which says that in Seattle in 1995--which is the latest year for which any data are available--there were over 16,000 calls to 911 related to domestic violence. 
It was just reported that there is an epidemic, an increase in the violence in Spokane County with more than 6,400 cases reported last year, which is a big increase over prior years. 
In Tacoma, where a young police officer was just killed, it is reported that during the past 15 years 11 police officers in the Puget Sound area have been killed in the line of duty. Four of those officers were slain while responding to calls to help settle domestic disputes, a huge portion of them. 
We need to make sure that as a body we do everything we can to help women get out of domestic violence situations in a safe and responsible manner, to get them back to work in a way that economically works, that their health care is taken care of, that their children are taken care of so that they get out of these situations. If the work requirement remains in place, women will be forced to stay at home with their abuser. They will not be able to go out and get themselves economically independent in a responsible way. 
Mr. President, 27 States have asked for a waiver on family violence. Until we clarify the language here in the Senate and approve it in conference, these States will not be able to move forward without being penalized under the work requirements of the welfare bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment with a recorded vote this time so that we can send it to conference and do the responsible thing that is required of all of us when we care in a humane way about women who are in a situation in which none of us ever wants to be. 
I see my colleague, Senator Landrieu, a cosponsor of the amendment, is here, and I yield her time to speak.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, for her excellent statement and for all of her support and her help on this very important piece of legislation. 
I know that Senator Wellstone also wants to speak on behalf of our amendment today, and I believe he is on his way to the floor. While we are waiting for him, let me read a paragraph or two from a press release put out by the Children's Defense Fund today, who, as I spoke about before, know firsthand what happens to children in violent situations. I quote: 
Mothers who have been threatened or battered need a safe place for themselves and their children and they need support to reenter the work force. Passage of the family violence amendment makes it possible for States to offer that protection and to help mothers with children. 
There are studies by the Better Homes Fund and the University of Massachusetts Medical Center and by the Taylor Institute in Chicago that have documented the prevalence of domestic violence in the lives of women and children receiving public assistance. It is important that we pass this amendment today so that we can make sure these women and these children are taken care of in this country and live in safe environments. 
Mr. President, I am going to yield time now to Senator Wellstone, who has been instrumental in this battle. I thank him for all of his work on behalf of the many women and children across this country who will be able to feel much safer when we finally get this passed and put into the law.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am going to ask shortly for a rollcall vote on this amendment. It is imperative we have a strong rollcall vote on the underlying amendment so we can move it to conference with a very strong message from the U.S. Senate that we are going to support this with our voices, with our votes, and that we are going to watch it in the conference committee so it remains in this time. 
We are going to send a strong message to the White House that this body is not just doing this as some kind of political maneuver, we are doing it because we mean it and our votes are going to back it up. We are not just going to talk about domestic violence, we are going to be there to make sure the action takes place to take care of the women who are abused and are put in this horrendous situation that each of us hopes never to be in. It is imperative we do this for the women who are being abused. It is also imperative we do it for the neighborhoods and communities they live in. And it is imperative we do it for our police officers across this country who are put in these violent situations far too often today. We need to do our part to prevent that from happening as well. 
Mr. President, I am ready to yield the remainder of my time if there is no one going to speak in opposition, and to ask for the yeas and nays.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this body is about to go to a vote that is not one that is unknown to this Senate. It is regarding the welfare bill that was passed a year or so ago, an amendment that we offered at that time that was unanimously approved by this body and sent to the conference committee that merely allows a woman who is a victim of domestic violence a temporary waiver from the work requirements if she needs to get medical care or she needs to change her Social Security number so that she is not pursued by her abuser, or to put her children in a safe place so she is not worried about them and can work without being concerned about what happens to her children while she is at work. 
It is a temporary waiver. It has been passed by the Senate three times. Not one Senator has spoken against it. Not one Senator has voted against it. But every time it goes behind closed doors in a conference committee it is pulled out. 
That is what happens to abused women constantly. In the light of day, everyone is there to say, `I support you,' but when they go behind closed doors they are abused. 
I call on the Senate to vote with a strong voice to the members of the conference committee. We want this amendment to remain in so women across this country, children across this country, communities across this country, and police who are required to come to the scenes of domestic violence incidents are safe once again. 
I yield my remaining time to Senator Wellstone, who has been helpful in this debate and has been very good at working through this.

Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair. 
I rise in support today of the pending Gorton-Murray amendment. I think, as we are all aware, President Clinton recently signed into law legislation that really calls for the largest expansion of children's health care since the creation of Medicaid in 1965. I worked very hard on this initiative with my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Rockefeller. I was really thrilled to be a part of this historic effort to provide real health care security to the most precious and vulnerable children in our Nation. I think that is an accomplishment of which we can all be very proud, and it will not only provide health care security for our children but economic security and peace of mind for millions of hard-working parents as well. 
I know the benefits of expanding health care benefits for children because my home State of Washington took a similar step back in 1994. The State took the lead because it was concerned about the future of its children and it was expecting us to enact a comprehensive national health security act for Americans at that time. The State of Washington wanted to be sure that our children were the first priority in any health care security efforts, and I applauded the action by the State and am pleased to report that all children through the age of 18 in Washington State who live in families up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level are covered. The State did not have to take that step and expanded their Medicaid program beyond any Federal mandatory level. As a result of that action, 427,000 children are now guaranteed access to quality, affordable health care. This is a fact that I take a great deal of pride in, and I know that our public health system has benefited. 
In the last Congress, when I started working to expand health care insurance for 10 million children, I was assured that any expansion would benefit all States and that those States that had expanded their programs up to 200 percent of poverty would not be treated differently. I had seen the success in my State and seen the benefits of providing comprehensive health care to uninsured children. As a result, I worked hard to fight for nationwide expansion. 
During negotiations, I worked with several other Members to ensure that the amount of funding for children's health care was increased. I supported efforts in the Chamber to fund this expansion at $24 billion, providing the greatest amount of resources available that will ensure the greatest number of children are insured. 
The final budget reconciliation legislation was a major victory for children and families in this country, but unfortunately my State of Washington will not benefit to the degree I had hoped. My State and others that made the commitment to their children previously and provided coverage up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level will not be able to access the $24 billion that was provided for in this bill. The State will have to expand their current program by 50 percent in order to access any of those new funds. I am hopeful that the State will act to cover more children, if the resources are available at our State level, but in the immediate future Washington State will not be able to provide 
additional coverage, meaning that the intent of the legislation to cover more uninsured children will not be met in my State. We have made great strides in covering uninsured children, but we still have over 300,000 children who have no health insurance. We should be making every effort to encourage our States to expand the number of children covered, not discourage them from doing so. 
The Gorton amendment would only allow States that have covered children up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level to access the children's health block grant money to cover children from 133 percent to 200 percent of the poverty level, meaning that States could access these funds for new children that are not currently required to be covered. Again, this would apply only to new children as of October 1, 1997. Any child currently enrolled up to 200 percent would remain in the Medicaid Program. We are simply trying to treat new children in Washington State the same as they will be treated in Idaho or Montana or any other State. A new ensured child is a new ensured child regardless of which State they live in. 
I have heard some of the concerns about this amendment and the impact that it could have on States that are currently at 200 percent. Let me assure my colleagues that, unfortunately, there are not many at this level. I have also heard about the substitution effect. Included in this amendment is a requirement that the State must certify that the child has not been insured in the past. We are only talking about an insured child as of October 1 of this year. 
Finally, this amendment only applies to those new children that the State made the decision to cover, the optional children. Those below the 133 percent will not be included for any match purposes. 
My colleagues should also keep in mind that there is already strong maintenance-of-effort requirements in the act which apply to the States as well. I listened to my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator Rockefeller. I understand their concerns and I want to remind them that we all share the same goal. I hope we can continue to work on this so that the children in my State are treated as equally as other children across the Nation regarding that $24 billion. Our Governor has told us he needs this amendment to look forward to ensuring new children. I hope we can continue to work together to make sure that happens for the children of Washington State as well as the rest of this country. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Gorton.  
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on September 3, during floor deliberations the senior Senator from Washington presented a story of a most tragic situation on the Yakama Indian Reservation in his call for support of an appropriations rider that would require tribal governments to relinquish their right to sovereign immunity in order to receive Federal funding. 
In 1994, a tragic accident involving a tribal police officer en route to the scene of an ensuing robbery resulted in the death of 18-year-old Jered Gamache. Before I proceed, I want to express my deepest sympathies to the Gamache family for this devastating loss. As a mother of two, I find it almost unbearable to contemplate such a loss. It is always painful to lose a loved one, but the loss of a child is something no parent should have to face.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center recently marked the end of an era with the retirement of its visionary president and director, Dr. Robert W. Day. 
In 1981, Dr. Day took over leadership of the center from its founding director, Dr. Bill Hutchinson. It was a time of painful transition for the young research facility. In Dr. Day, the center had a new leader who possessed the administrative skills, broad scientific perspective, ambitious vision and fiery passion needed to guide the center through this critical period. During Dr. Day's 16 year tenure, the center transformed from a local medical facility to one of the world's most respected cancer research facilities. 
There are many legacies of Dr. Day's remarkable leadership. Perhaps the most visible is the magnificent South Lake Union research facility. Other prominent reminders are the many biotechnology firms that have been spawned by research conducted at the Hutchinson Center. 
Among Dr. Day's most important legacies are his contributions to cancer policy. He is credited with pioneering the integration of public health and cancer research, which had primarily focused on basic and clinical research. He played a key role in launching and expanding the preventive program at the Centers for Disease Control. He is largely responsible for the Hutchinson Center being awarded the Nation's first cancer prevention research unit. Public education was also an important priority for Dr. Day, and he undertook the strengthening of the Cancer Information Service. 
Because of his tremendous experience, Dr. Day has been widely sought out to fill advisory roles. In addition to his duties at Fred Hutchinson, Dr. Day has served on a number of influential national boards, including the National Cancer Advisory Board, the President's Cancer Advisory Council and countless peer-review committees. He is also a past president of the national Coalition for Cancer Research and of the American Association of Cancer Institutes. 
Dr. Day has become a much respected figure on Capitol Hill. I appreciate the insight he has given me on legislative matters and his role in educating Members of this body on the issues surrounding cancer research. His influence and respect in the business community has helped to make the business community an important partner in cancer research efforts. 
Dr. Day is regarded as not only an outstanding administrator and scientist, but as an outstanding human being. There can be no doubt that his passion for fighting cancer comes from the fact that he is a man who genuinely cares about people. 
Dr. Day's well-deserved retirement will leave him time to devote to other personal interests. However, even in retirement he will continue to lend his considerable talent as a senior adviser to the center. 
While the war against cancer has yet to be won, thanks to Dr. Day's remarkable efforts, much progress has been made. He has my lasting appreciation for his passionate leadership and his unending faith that one day we will win the battle against this terrible disease. He will continue to be an inspiration to those who seek to make his vision a reality.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is a good day for regular people. Today, we are putting our differences aside, making smart compromises, and getting the peoples' work done. After 3 years of strife, partisanship, and government shutdowns, I am glad to see that this Congress is finally coming together for the good of the people. 
As I listen to the debate on the historic balanced budget reconciliation bill, I can't help but remember the first budget that I helped draft as a new Member of the Budget Committee, the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. It was a 5-year deficit reduction plan that reduced the deficit from nearly $300 billion in 1993 to about $60 billion for 1997. 
The 1993 plan had deep spending reductions and ambitious goals for reducing the deficit. But it also contained important new investments in our economy, our work force, and our children. That plan passed without one vote from the other side, which I think is unfortunate. I stood on the floor of the Senate and listened to speech after speech from my colleagues on the other side claiming the plan would force the economy into recession and explode the deficit. 
I am proud to stand here today and say that the exact opposite happened. Our economy is strong and growing at a steady rate, and the deficit has declined each year since. Balancing the budget is no longer an insurmountable goal. The 1993 plan brought us within reach. A lot of Members had the courage to make the tough calls back then. Some of them are no longer here in the Senate. But the state of the Nation today--the low deficit and the booming economy--has vindicated the 1993 plan. 
The Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act before us today finishes the job. We will balance the budget by 2002; we have protected the solvency of the Medicare Program without draconian cuts; we have expanded our investment in education; and we have created a new children's health insurance program to cover an additional 5 million children who have no health security; and we have provided moderate tax relief. This is a balanced and fair plan. 
The real winners today are our working families; senior citizens; and our children. Not only do they benefit from the largest investment in education since 1965; the largest investment in children's health since 1965; and the fiscal soundness of the Medicare Program, but we all win when we reduce the deficit and balance the budget. We are already seeing the fiscal and economic dividends from reducing the deficit, and this will only continue. 
Let me say now I was deeply concerned when this legislation originally passed the Senate. So concerned, in fact, that I had to vote no on the Senate bill. The changes in the Medicare Program that were included would have seriously altered the program and threatened the health care security for millions of senior citizens. 
Immediately following that vote, I began working to ensure that these changes were removed from the final conference agreement. I could not and would not support anything that would result in more individuals being un-insured. Increasing the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 would have only added to the 47 million Americans with no health insurance. The means testing of the part B premium was not just an administrative nightmare, but a short-term solution that would have only forced higher premiums on all seniors regardless of income. The $5 copayment for home health care would have fallen disproportionately on low-income women. Well over two-thirds of women over 65 earn less than $13,000 a year. A $5 copayment for each home health care visit could have added hundreds of dollars a year to the cost of health care for millions of low-income senior citizens. 
I could not have supported the final agreement if these provisions had remained. Because I was committed to a balanced budget, I knew I had to work hard to ensure that these provisions were dropped. I spoke with the White House, with the conferees, and with many of my colleagues and constituents about this, and I am pleased our hard work paid off. The final agreement slows the growth of Medicare without forcing more seniors into poverty and does not jeopardize the level of care that we have guaranteed to our senior citizens. 
I know many families in Washington State who are struggling to pay for college or who are worried about the financial burden of a college education for their child. Included in today's agreement are real tax incentives to help families invest in their child's education and to provide relief to today's students who are struggling under a huge burden of debt. As I said earlier, families are the winners today. This agreement will help those families who are struggling to help their child and will keep a college education within reach. 
In 1993, I worked with many of my colleagues in Congress and with the Clinton administration in an effort to enact comprehensive health care reform that would guarantee health care coverage for all Americans. Lack of affordable, quality health insurance coverage was and still is a major problem for many individuals. Unfortunately, our plan was too ambitious and the American people told us that they wanted smaller, targeted reforms. In 1996 we enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Kennedy/Kassebaum, which expands health care access for workers between jobs and provides protections for those with pre-existing conditions. This legislation was an important step in improving health care access for all Americans. 
Today's agreement takes another big step by providing $24 billion to improve access to health insurance for the 10 1/2 million children who lack any direct access to quality, comprehensive health care. This new health insurance program that will improve the quality of life for millions of children and families, is the real crown jewel of this agreement. 
I have spent a great deal of time and energy pushing for expanded health care coverage for children. I have always considered this to be one of my top priorities and feel some relief today knowing that we have succeeded. In Washington State, we made a similar commitment to our children back in 1993, today's agreement will give us the opportunity to build on this commitment and reach out to more children. 
While I feel a great sense of accomplishment today, there is one group of individuals who will not be celebrating. Despite the fact that my family violence option clarification amendment was adopted on three separate occasions, the budget conferees chose to once again try and sweep domestic violence under the rug. Victims of domestic violence were forgotten in this agreement. My amendment, adopted three times by the U.S. Senate, would have given States the ability to waive victims of domestic violence from the work requirements and time limitations called for in the new welfare reform law. It was not a secret way to allow women to stay on welfare, as many claim, but rather a way to protect victims of domestic violence and help them get out of poverty. There is no good reason--no excuse whatsoever--why this provision should have been taken out of the agreement. This is perhaps the greatest disappointment for me in this whole process. 
I am committed to moving this amendment again and again until my colleagues understand how violence and abuse can be life threatening barriers to work. I will keep making my colleagues vote on this amendment until we have succeeded. Those who oppose this amendment need to understand that when they vote `no' they will be voting against victims of domestic violence and abuse. 
Looking back over the past 4 years, I am amazed at the progress we have made on reducing the deficit and yet I know that it was not an easy task. I always believed we could balance the budget and still maintain important investment programs, but it does take a great deal of work and many, many tough decisions. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee I have had to make those decisions and choices. But, I always knew that it could be done. Today's agreement is my proof.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report on H.R. 2014, The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. This legislation represents the second part of the historic balanced budget agreement. 
As a member of the Budget Committee, I was originally concerned about enacting major tax changes which would jeopardize our deficit reduction progress. I did not want to repeat the mistakes of the 1980's. Back then, Congress did the easy thing in dramatically cutting taxes, but put off the tough decisions on spending cuts. As a result, the National debt increased from $1 to $4 trillion, and we've been digging the country out of that hole ever since. 
I also had to be sure that, if we did any kind of tax cut, it would be targeted, to working families who desperately need relief and that it was responsible. I had to be sure that it did not add to the deficit and would truly serve as an investment in our economic productivity. 
After months of working with the White House and Republicans, we have produced a tax relief package that is responsible, targeted, and will provide significant investment in our economy. It does not add to the deficit--we borrow nothing to offset these cuts. 
The tax relief package includes a $500-per-child tax credit that will go to every family earning less than $110,000 per year. This tax credit alone will be available for approximately 27 million families with 45 million children, with 13 million of these children coming from families with incomes below $30,000 a year. This includes children who's parents are teachers, farmers, factory workers, police officers, and nurses--the real working families of this country. 
When I first came to the U.S. Senate, I made a commitment to the many small, familyowned businesses and farms in the State, that I would work to reduce the estate tax. I had talked to many people with concerns that their business or farm would have to be sold if they died, rather than being passed on to their children. Because the estate tax is so high, younger generations cannot afford to keep the business or farm in the family. 
I introduced legislation to reform the inheritance tax last Congress for two simple reasons. First, the current tax code hits my home State of Washington very hard, because we have a very high percentage of family farms, and tree farms in particular, as well as many entrepreneurial small, high tech businesses. Second, the impact of the current structure of the estate tax had to be changed in order to allow family owned businesses to stay family owned. I am pleased the bill included estate tax relief that is similar to my legislation. 
I am also pleased that included within this tax relief package is the accelerated phase-in of self-employed health insurance deduction from 40 per cent up to 80 percent. This is a major victory for small business, farms, and their families. It will also allow more small business owners to purchase quality health care for their children. I have long argued that small businesses should be given the same tax allowance for health insurance as afforded large corporations. This accelerated phase-in will provide this equity and expand access to health insurance coverage for many children who's parents are self-employed. 
Perhaps the greatest expense facing many families is that of a college education. I know many middle-class families in Washington State who are struggling to pay for their children's college education. I have also heard from many hard-working adults who cannot afford to upgrade their skills or further their education. We all know the value of investing in the education of our children and investing in our own skills and education. Yet, for many families a college education was becoming unreachable. The tax relief package before us today will give middle-class families that extra help to meet the ever escalating cost of a post secondary education. 
The legislation calls for a total of $35 billion in education tax credits and incentives. This represents the biggest single investment in the education of our children since 1965. It will give those families who are struggling to pay for a college education the help that they need. As we move in to the next century, it means our children have the skills and education to meet the challenges of tomorrow. Our work force will need to be one of the most technologically advanced in the world in order to maintain our competitive edge and our high standard of living. Investing in today's children is not just an investment in their future, but it is an investment that will maintain our position as a global, economic power. 
This bill also contains reductions in the capital gains tax. I am pleased that we have been able to craft this part of the bill so that it targets regular, middle-class families. Many middle-class families have been burdened with heavy capital gains when they sold a home or even sold stocks for retirement savings. In addition, the legislation drops the capital gains tax from the 20 percent called for in the bill to 10 percent for joint filers with incomes less than $41,200 who sell or transfer an asset held for at least 18 months. For higher income earners the top rate will be 20 percent for investments held for at least 18 months. Carefully crafted and targeted, a capital gains tax cut will encourage economic expansion and will provide equal relief to the middle class. This legislation meets this test. 
In 1993 our deficit was close to $300 billion annually. New estimates for 1997 by the Congressional Budget Office indicate that the deficit for this year could be as low as $67 billion. We have far exceeded even my expectations for deficit reduction. The spending plan just adopted by this body will eliminate this deficit by 2002. Now is the time to give working families their share of the deficit reduction dividend. This legislation will guarantee that middle class, working families benefit equally from the economic gains we have seen as a result of the Democratic deficit reduction plan of 1993. 
I know that this tax relief package and the balanced budget spending plan would not have been possible without a honest, bipartisan approach. While I know that many on the other side do not think that this tax relief package is big enough, any further attempt to cut taxes would have all but wiped out the $223 billion in deficit reduction that we witnessed since 1993. This legislation is fair and equitable, but fiscally responsible as well. For the sake of our grandchildren and continued economic growth, we cannot enact deep tax cuts that force us to only borrow more to pay for these cuts. Balancing the budget must remain our No. 1 goal and priority. 
I urge my colleagues to support this conference report and I yield back the balance of my time. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Northwest Wildland Fire Protection Agreement. This compact will help our States throughout the Northwest respond more quickly and efficiently to wildfires. Senators Craig, Wyden, Murkowski, Kempthorne, Gorton, G. Smith, Baucus, and Burns have joined me as original cosponsors because this compact affects all of our States of Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Idaho, and Montana. It establishes an agreement with the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, and the Yukon Territory to mutually aid in prevention, pre-suppression and control of forest fires. 
Mr. State's Commissioner of Public Lands, Jennifer Belcher, brought this compact to my attention. She explained how for the State of Washington, this means the Department of Natural Resources will have access to the excellent firefighting tools of British Columbia, including helicopters and other aircraft stationed close to the border. This will increase her ability to quickly mobilize forces to suppress wildfires that might otherwise get out of control. 
The Washington DNR has been fighting wildfires since the early 1900's. According to a DNR Forest Fire Study, in the past 25 years, the department has fought 28,000-plus wildfires involving more than 370,000 acres of Washington forest land. In recent years, firefighting budgets have decreased and the intensity of fires has increased, with the terrible fire season of 1994 breaking the record at 79,000 acres burned in Washington. We need this compact to enable our States to better protect the life and property of our citizens. 
All eight affected States and provinces have agreed to this compact. However, before the States and Provinces can legally enter this agreement, the U.S. Congress must pass enabling legislation. Congress did so in 1952 with the wildfire compact after which this legislation was patterned, which was signed by five northeastern States and eastern Provinces, and remains in effect today. 
I urge my colleagues to help us move this compact through the process so our States will be poised to quickly and cost-efficiently suppress dangerous wildfires. I would also like to urge colleagues to support another compact introduced by Senator Craig and cosponsored by all Northwest Senators to help us join forces in cases of natural disasters.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Washington State lost a visionary leader, a passionate advocate, and a remarkable woman with the passing of Jerline Ware. As a citizen activist and as a public servant, Jeri Ware worked tirelessly for social justice and to ensure a brighter future for our community's children. 
Jeri Ware may best be remembered as the chairwoman of the Seattle Human Rights Commission. This position gave her the opportunity to do in an official capacity what she had done her entire life: fight against discrimination and for equality and human rights. She never gave up believing in a just society and never shied away from speaking out for those who had been wronged. Just last December, the Seattle Human Rights Commission honored Jeri for her tireless commitment and dedication. 
Jeri's other passion was our community's young people. She recognized that the future well-being of our community depended on our having a shared sense of responsibility for all our children and giving them the best possible start in life. She put this conviction into action by working in the tutorial program at the University of Washington and as a parent coordinator at Seattle's Leschi School. 
We will miss not only Jeri Ware the activist and community leader, but also Jeri Ware the friend. She was a woman who was always willing to open her heart and home. 
Jeri leaves her husband of 49 years, John, sons Anthony Muhammed and John Ware, daughters Joan Ware and Falicia Green, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren; to whom our thoughts go out. 
Jeri Ware's passing at the all-too-young age of 73 leaves a great void. However, her courage, commitment and unending faith in a just society will continue to be an inspiration to all those who share her vision.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the appropriation measure before us includes $363 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service. In addition, the Committee recommendation allows for the administration's proposed increased of 58 full-time equivalents [FTE's] for the National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS]. The Committee directs the NMFS to use as many available FTE's as are needed to ensure the full and timely implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The Magnuson-Stevens Act was reauthorized in the 104th Congress after a long and difficult process of negotiation and compromise. It includes many new provisions to improve the conservation and management of this Nation's fishery resources. I appreciate the tremendous task the NMFS faces in fully implementing all of the new provisions and requirements we placed on the NMFS and share the committee's desire to see adequate FTE's allocated to this important task. 
I am also concerned, however, about the very real need for FTE's to implement the requirements of the Endangered Species Act [ESA], particularly in the Pacific Northwest. With several salmon species already listed under the ESA and an elaborate recovery plant currently being implemented with a critical decision point rapidly approaching, with habitat conservation plans being negotiated with public utility districts in central Washington, and additional ESA listings likely coming in the future, the NMFS is in desperate need of both resources and personnel to meet its obligations. I appreciate the committee's willingness to fund NMFS efforts in these areas at or above the President's requested levels. These funds will go along way toward salmon recovery efforts throughout the entire Pacific coast. I would like to emphasize the need for adequate FTE's to be provided to this important effort. While the committee has correctly directed FTE's to the implementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, this allocation should not come at the expense of the agency's ability to undertake salmon recovery efforts in the Pacific Northwest. Both of these responsibilities of the NMFS are vitally important to Washington State and the Pacific Northwest. I urge the NMFS to meet the real need for FTE's in both of these areas.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd resolution. 
I will vote for this resolution, first, because the concerns of American workers and industry must be considered in any treaty into which this country enters. This resolution unequivocally sends that message. 
Second, it should be without dispute that developing nations must control their emissions if we are to reduce greenhouse gas. This resolution strengthens our bargaining position to ensure real, attainable standards are established for developing countries, too. 
I want to make it clear, however, that I support a negotiated global warming treaty. I believe science and common sense mandate that we work to reduce emissions and increase forest conservation to offset emissions. 
Regarding the developed-developing nation debate, I believe it is also clear that we developed nations have historically emitted more greenhouse gases per capita than have developing countries. In addition, we are economically more able to absorb whatever increased costs occur based on the need to reduce emissions. Therefore, we should assist our neighbors through technology transfer, economic assistance, and joint ventures in meeting whatever emissions goals are established. 
I offer my strong support to the administration as it continues negotiations to reduce greenhouse gases worldwide. I thank Senator Byrd for strengthening the American bargaining position with this resolution.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Feinstein amendment. We simply should not--must not--divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on an appropriations bill. It is an irresponsible way to proceed with such a fundamentally important question about how we best administer justice in the West. 
I want to remind my colleagues that this body, the Senate, in the 104th Congress twice approved a study commission bill. In June, the House of Representatives sent us a bill, H.R. 908, establishing a similar commission. That bill is waiting at the desk for our action. House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde has voiced his dismay at this end run around his authorizing committee. Tuesday he wrote to Chairman Hatch, saying: `As you well know, altering the structure of the Federal judicial system is a serious matter. It is something that Congress does rarely, and only after careful consideration.' 
Mr. President, I am not necessarily opposed to a split of the ninth circuit, but I am adamantly opposed to an appropriation's rider mandating such a gerrymandered split. As Chairman Hyde suggested, we need judicial experts thoroughly analyzing the courts and advising us on what makes sense from a national perspective. 
With so many of those who work directly in the ninth circuit opposed to this split, it seems clear we need guidance before we act. The White House opposes this split, the majority of judges on the ninth circuit oppose this split, and the majority of bar associations of the affected States oppose this split. Simply put, this is not the right way to proceed. 
We need answers to some important questions first. How much will this cost? Should we create a virtual one-state court? Should Arizona become a part of the tenth circuit? Where should we place a new circuit's courthouse? How many judges should serve in each circuit and from which States should they come? Should we break the ninth circuit into three circuits? How will our Pacific maritime law be affected? Before I participate in breaking up an institution that is more than 100 years old, I want those--and many more questions--answered. 
Mr. President, I also have another concern. I find it interesting that supporters of this rider so often refer to the pace at which the ninth circuit does its business. Yet, these same Senators have done little or nothing to fill the many vacancies plaguing the ninth circuit. An outstanding member of the Washington State legal community, Margaret McKeown, has been languishing for nearly 2 years in this body. She has yet to receive a hearing. This is unconscionable and this has real impact on the administration of justice. To make the ninth circuit--or any circuit--work, we must have judges. Let's get the confirmation process moving, and that will stop the glacial pace that people are concerned about. 
Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that we have passed almost every fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill without contentious riders. We should have learned from the disaster relief bill what can happen when these riders dominate the process. I believe we should maintain the bipartisan approach we've used so far and avoid letting this important bill get bogged down with riders. 
Let's do our appropriations job right and let's do the very serious job of reconfiguring the judiciary right. I urge my colleagues to support the Feinstein amendment establishing a commission to guide the Congress on how best to resolve any real or perceived difficulties in the administration of justice in the ninth circuit. 
I yield my time back to the Senator from California.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to urge the chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, State Justice Appropriations Subcommittee to join me in directing the National Marine Fisheries Service, through the Information and Analyses, Resource Information account, to provide $250,000 to the Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center in Seattle, WA. 
The Odyssey Center is a new educational learning center opening in July, 1998. This Center will establish an educational link between the everyday maritime, fishing, trade, and environmental activities that occur in the waters of Puget Sound and Alaska, and the lessons students learn in the classroom. Through high-tech and interactive exhibits, over 300,000 children and adults per year will discover that what happens in our waters, on our coast lines, at our ports affects our State's and Nation's economic livelihood, environmental well-being, and international competitiveness. The Center wishes to establish an exhibits and lecture series to link the public, particularly school children, with the maritime, fishing, trade, and environmental industries. Named in honor of the great Senator of Washington, Warren G. Magnuson, this series would begin in 1998 and would serve as an educational resource on the sustainable development, uses, and protection of our seas and coastal waters. This series would provide a fitting tribute to Senator Magnuson, the founder of this Nation's Federal fisheries policies and the namesake of our principal fisheries management law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I have come this morning to join my colleagues in talking about the issue of tax fairness that this Congress is now working toward in the conference committee between the Senate and House, working with the White House, to move us toward the 
final parts of the budget reconciliation and tax package. 
First of all, I want to say it is really incredible to me that I stand here today in the summer of 1997 talking about a tax cut. When I came to the Senate, back in 1992, I came at a time when we had a $300 billion deficit. And I remember campaigning back in that year, when Ross Perot was running around the country showing us his charts of the exploding deficit, and for all of us who were elected in that year and since that time our No. 1 goal has been to come here to balance the budget. 
As one of those people who came here in 1992, with a $300 billion deficit, I have continually told my constituents, the families that I represent, the people that I work for, that my No. 1 goal here is to get to a balanced budget, and that although I agree that tax cuts are a good thing to have, that we need to do it in a rational way and we should not do it until we get to a balanced budget. 
I remember back in 1993, when we passed our first budget here, it was a budget that we all remember well, that passed by one vote here in the Senate, that began us on the road today to where we are now in the summer of 1997 able to talk about a tax cut because we made a tough decision 4 years ago to work us toward that balanced budget. 
We now have a deficit that is less than $70 billion. And in fact, some predict that without Congress doing anything, we will be at a balanced budget within a year because of the tough votes that we have taken over the last 5 years. Because of the Members here who were willing to say no to many of the special interests who came to us and wanted more and more, we were able to say no. And we have worked very, very hard to get ourselves to this point. 
Having said that, I am a member of the Budget Committee. I have worked very hard since the beginning of this year to put together the budget reconciliation package, to work with my fellow members on the Budget Committee, to work with the White House, to work through the conference, to get to the point of having a balanced budget to present to this country. 
As part of that agreement, we do have a tax cut package. Because I have worked hard on that, because I am committed to the reconciliation package that the Budget Committee agreed to, I did vote for the tax cut package that came out of the Senate. 
That tax cut is now being debated by the conference committee again between the Senate and the House and the President, the White House, and I think the most important thing we can do at this point as we work to the final negotiation of this package is make sure we do the right thing for this country. 
When I fly home to my State of Washington 2,500 miles away from here, every weekend I spend time attending town hall meetings, going around to small communities in my State. Where I get the best input is when I go to the grocery store on Sunday afternoons with my family and people walk up to me and talk to me about what they are hearing about what is happening in Congress. Time and time again I have young people coming to me--a young teacher this past Sunday, a policeman, a young family--and their question is the same as every other American: What am I going to get out of the tax cut? What will I get? I hear the Members of this Senate and this body asking the same question as well: What am I going to get out of this tax cut? 
I think the important question is not what am I going to get out of this tax cut, but what will this tax cut do to strengthen the America that we all worked so hard here for, and what can we do so that 10, 15, 20 years from now we are not having another Ross Perot run around the country with charts and graphs showing a deficit that is out of control. 
As I talk to my constituents around my State, what I hear most often is that if we invest in our young people, invest in our children, we will do the right thing for the country's future. When I look at this tax package, those are the questions I ask. Are we doing the right thing so that young children, as they grow up and get out and start their own families, have the money they need to make sure that their children get a good education, that they have access to health care, that they are able to send their children to college. That is how we are going to make our country strong. 
So when I look at this tax package that we are now debating, I see that the President's tax package will actually do the most for those young families, for that young teacher, for that young policeman, for that young law clerk, for that family that is just starting out, for those families who are earning less than $30,000 or $40,000 a year. That is why I believe so strongly that the refundable tax credit has to be part of this package. 
I see my colleague on the floor, Senator Landrieu, who is new here, from Louisiana, who has worked very hard to ensure that the tax cut is refundable. Yet, I hear this being debated, I hear it characterized as the people who are on earned income tax credit, those who are earning less than $25,000 or $30,000 a year, if we give them a tax credit, it is giving tax credits to people who are on welfare. Nothing could be further from the truth. These are working families. They go to work every day. They are struggling to make ends meet. They are paying for day care. They are working to make sure they have nutritious food on the table. They are trying to save a few dollars for their children to go on to higher education so they can contribute to our economy. Those are the people we need to help. Those are the people that the President's tax cut really goes to, and that is what we have an obligation as a Senate and a Congress today to make sure that we take care of in the future. 
We will do the wrong thing if we pass a tax cut that merely inflates the income of those at the top, that gives away tax dollars to people who are already able to send their children to college, who are already able to take vacations in exotic places, who are already able to ensure that their family has a good home and a safe neighborhood to live in. We will do the right thing if we make sure that the tax cuts we pass help those young families who are struggling today, because if we lift them up and make sure that their children are healthy and well-educated and secure and that they have a good quality of life, then this country will be stronger in the future. 
I urge my colleagues to step back from this big debate about who is going to benefit and how the tax package will be put together, and say, what do I want this country to look like 10, 15, 20 years from now? Do I want to see it strong? Do I want to see a lot of young people with hope in their eyes who know they will be able to go to college? Do I want to see young families who are saying, I can save enough to buy a home and feel secure? Do I want to see a country where children have the nutrition that they need, that have the health care that they need? If that is the country we want, we will ensure that we move toward the President's tax cut, that we have a refundable tax credit in here, that we put our tax cuts where they will make the most difference. 
That is why I support the President's tax cut plan and urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the DeWine amendment (No. 936) to the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. This amendment is nothing more than another attempt to attack basic reproductive health services for Federal employees and their dependents. This has become an annual tradition during consideration of appropriations bills. 
What always surprises me about this amendment is the arguments used in defense of denying Federal employees access to the same reproductive health and choices afforded most private sector employees. We are told that this is a matter of not allowing for the use of Federal funds for abortion related services. But, this is not argument does not make sense when one considers that most Federal employees contribute to their own health insurance through premiums, deductibles, and copayments. In addition, health insurance benefits are a form of compensation for services rendered. They are not viewed as a direct Federal payment, but rather a cost of labor. If we believe that Federal health insurance benefits are not a form of compensation, but rather a direct Federal payment to employees, then we should be looking to refund women who selected health insurance based on the reproductive services provided. If it was a direct Federal payment, why would the insurance companies be reluctant to reimburse all female Federal employees the cost of these services? 
If one were to take this argument to the next level, then supporters of this amendment should be looking to forbid any Federal employee from using their salary to pay for abortion related services. Maybe we should have whole list of things that Federal employees cannot use their own salaries to support. But, we know that offering this type of amendment would expose the true motivation behind this continued attack on a woman's right to a safe and legal abortion. 
That is what we should be discussing; the continued erosion of access to safe and legal abortion services. Instead of these piecemeal attempts, perhaps we should have a full and open debate on banning a woman's right to chose. That is what this amendment is all about. It is not Federal funding, but rather another attempt to further restrict and control access to safe reproductive health services. Using Federal funding simply allows those who oppose a woman's right to chose the chance to hide behind a baseless argument. 
I feel confident that few Members in the U.S. Senate would be comfortable telling all women that they are no longer protected and can no longer be guaranteed access to a safe, affordable abortion regardless of the circumstances. Few Senators would want to tell their constituents that the issue is not for them to decide, but rather the decision has been made by the U.S. Senate. So instead, the strategy is to hide behind issues like the use of Federal funds, or Federal facilities. 
Putting aside the issue of abortion for a moment, as guardians of the FEHBP and Federal employees, we must ask if it is right to deny a Federal employee access to a safe and affordable 
abortion. Currently, there are approximately 1.2 million women of reproductive age who rely on the FEHBP for their medical care. These women, by simply choosing a career in public service, agree to be discriminated against every day when it comes to health insurance coverage. 
Approximately, two thirds of private fee-for-service plans and 70 percent of HMO's provide abortion coverage. Many of these same plans participate in the FEHBP and must offer a different level of benefits for Federal employees. They are legally allowed to discriminate against women who are also Federal employees. In no other situation would Congress stand for this form of discrimination within a plan that participates in the FEHBP. But, today we are voting to do just that. 
I am always surprised by the lack of understanding of the real problems facing real people, shown by some of my colleagues. Supporters of this amendment state that a woman can still get an abortion, but she simply cannot receive health insurance coverage for this care. This may sound reasonable until one considers that costs for this type of care can be anywhere from $400 to several thousand dollars depending upon the severity of the problem. For many female Federal employees, who are in most cases the lowest paid, this is a lot of money. It might as well be $10,000. In addition, what guarantee is there that the care will be adequate and meet the standard of care for all FEHBP participants? Unfortunately, there are no guarantees. 
This could also create additional costs and problems for insurance plans. We all know that an unsafe abortion can be life threatening. We can also assume that there is followup care required to ensure the overall health of the woman. Who is responsible for this care? Who is financially responsible for the effects of unsafe abortion or in a situation where the woman could not afford the followup care required? Some of my colleagues seem to think that an abortion is a decision made with little or no thought, they must also assume that the procedure is done with little or no thought. I can assure you, no woman makes this decision lightly and like all surgical procedures there is always some risk. 
I strongly oppose this discriminatory attempt to deny 1.2 million Federal employees and their dependents access to safe, affordable health care coverage and urge my colleagues to think very carefully about voting to continue this discrimination. 
This is not about the use of Federal funds. We all know that not one Federal employee received a refund when Congress acted to eliminate this coverage. For most insurance plans, abortion related services are a part of a package of reproductive health benefits--they do not single out abortion. This amendment is simply about denying some women access to safe, affordable and comprehensive reproductive health care benefits. 
Mr. President, time and again, Members come to the floor to talk about how they support women's health. Once again, we are going to take reproductive health of women away from women. 
This is about the health of women. It is denying Federal employees the ability to make choices about their own reproductive health. 
I urge you to vote `no' on the DeWine amendment.  
Ms. MOSELEYBRAUN addressed the Chair.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to recommend this bill to the Senate. The recommended amount, $9.18 billion, is within the 602(b) allocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee and is frugal, some $600 million, or 6 percent below last year's appropriated level. 
Nevertheless, we have added nearly $800 million to the amount requested by the administration, primarily to correct serious shortfalls in the budget request for National Guard and Reserve forces, and for quality-of-life initiatives in housing and medical care for U.S. military personnel. 
In order to keep our Guard and Reserve forces healthy, we have again, as in the past, had to add substantial sums, some $392 million, to an inadequate request. 
As for housing, we have added approximately $152 million for family housing, and despite this increase, we are still about $301 million below last year's level. The added funds, however, are in the new area of housing initiatives known as privatization, whereby the money acts as seed capital which is multiplied over some three or four times with infusions of private developer funds, so the funds we have added carry an added punch. 
On another quality-of-life measure, we have added substantially to the request for medical and hospital facilities, increasing the request by nearly 50 percent, for a total of $208 million. 
These initiatives have been put together in a truly bipartisan fashion, in close cooperation with the distinguished chairman, Senator Burns and his staff. It is a good product, worthy of strong Senate support. I appreciate the courtesies that have been extended to me by the chairman and his staff, and believe this close working relationship has created a product which is balanced and fair to all Senators. 
We appropriated money for nearly all the projects authorized by the Senate Armed Services Committee, and have attempted to evaluate and satisfy the requests of all members fairly, and fund worthy projects, through design or minor construction if they have not been authorized. We have made every effort to include report language that members have suggested to us. 
We fully funded the BRAC request, some 22 percent of the bill, fully funded environmental projects, and we have tried to accommodate the sizable construction request for overseas projects, such as barracks in Europe and Korea. Overseas construction constitutes 24 percent of the overall construction request. 
The committee is concerned over the amounts that will be needed for additional costs of NATO expansion, based on the decisions at the Madrid summit, and for the funds requested for Southwest Asia propositioning of equipment in the nation of Qatar. We have asked for a report on NATO expansion costs by mid-October, hopefully in time for the Senate debate on this matter. 
We have also asked the administration to execute a burdensharing agreement with the Government of Qatar, whose population of 550,000 people enjoy a $21,000 per capita income and has, in fact, offered to help defray our expenses in our prepositioning program. 
This legislation is extremely important to our military personnel for many reasons. One of the most important for me is the messages we are able to send our active duty personnel serving abroad separated from family. We are providing for families--housing, day care, community support facilities--providing for families so our active duty personnel can focus on the task at hand when serving a tour on the U.S.S. Lincoln or patrolling near the DMZ in Korea. 
I am particularly pleased the committee was able to fund several authorized projects in Washington State. At Fairchild Air Force Base, we were able to meet the base's priority need for alterations to the fire station and provide moneys for an education center and a library. The committee was able to provide moneys for barracks replacement and a medical/dental clinic at Fort Lewis, and important C-17 facilities at McChord Air Force Base. I do appreciate the committee's willingness to be responsive to the needs of Washington State. 
I, again, thank the chairman for his help in making this a truly bipartisan bill, and I commend staff on both sides of the aisle for their outstanding professional work on this legislation. I join Chairman Burns in recommending that the Senate adopt this legislation with strong bipartisan support. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate Senator Mikulski on her amendment providing $20 million for America Reads under the VA-HUD Appropriations Act. 
There is no more important skill we can give young people in this country than the ability to read. If a child can read quickly and accurately early in her school career, all other challenges will be much easier for them in school and in life. 
I have been working for some time to bring literacy issues before the Senate, from the amendment Senator Simon and I offered to last year's welfare bill, to my work on the Appropriations Committee, to the educational briefings I host for congressional staff. 
Recently, these briefings have included information from Dr. Reid Lyon from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. We now know from the research that the process of reading involves several steps. A student must acquire skills in a logical progression, and in a timely manner, in order to be able to read quickly and effectively enough to make sense of what she reads. Once this process has occurred, reading becomes a tool for learning. If this process does not occur, the prospect of helping her learn to read becomes much more difficult. 
This and other evidence from research must inform what we do with regard to children's literacy. We must assure that we take advantage of the political will to improve children's literacy, by putting into place a national effort that reflects what we know. It must reflect what we know about how children learn, how important family literacy is to the literacy of the child, and what we know about how volunteer efforts work in our communities, among other things. 
In order to build a successful volunteer effort, which must be part of what we do for children's literacy, we need to look at all the aspects of the effort. In what capacity will volunteers be working with students? How will the primary reading teacher be involved? What about reading specialists? How will research inform what happens in the classroom, or in afterschool or summer programs using volunteers? Where will we find volunteers in communities already taxed for help? How will they be trained in providing literacy assistance, in recruiting volunteers, or in coordinating community programs? 
By simply including AmeriCorps in our efforts to improve children's literacy, we don't answer all of these questions, but we do answer some. We do call on experience already in our communities--in training, recruiting, and coordinating volunteers, in providing programs that help people learn to read, and to gain success in other areas of their lives. We do call on an incredible resource for improving people's engagement in their communities, and for improving their skills. 
Literacy AmeriCorps has been very successful in my home State of Washington, in doing things like setting up talk times for people with limited English proficiency to talk with one another in English, and practice what they are learning with other people, on topics that interest them. Community support is there--and that gives us a great base to expand on as we look to improve children's literacy. 
AmeriCorps has demonstrated success in many areas across the country; now it is time to enlist AmeriCorps in our efforts to help children learn to read. AmeriCorps is a much-needed ally in a complicated, difficult, and crucial endeavor. 
Again, I want to congratulate Senator Mikulski on her amendment, and encourage all of the Members of the Senate to work with us to improve children's literacy this year.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to once again join my colleague from Vermont, Senator James Jeffords, in introducing the James P. Grant World Summit for Children Implementation Act. I particularly want to pay tribute to Senator Jeffords for his continuing leadership in the effort to aid all children. 
The World Summit for Children Implementation Act is our effort to ensure that the United States implements the plan of action adopted at the 1990 United Nations World Summit for Children. Our legislation proposes a series of life-saving, cost-effective programs to protect the health and well-being of children worldwide. Importantly, while this legislation proposes several increases in individual foreign assistance programs, it does not call for an increase in overall foreign aid levels. 
Specifically, the Jeffords-Murray bill increases funding allocations for child survival, basic education, vitamin A and other micronutrients, UNICEF, AIDS prevention and care, refugee assistance, and family planning. Our bill also calls for an increase in funding for two important domestic programs: WIC and Head Start. 
The world's children have a right to adequate nutrition, full immunization, a decent education, and health care. The United States has traditionally led the way in promoting the well-being of children. Because the nations of the world are more interdependent than ever before, the well-being of children around the globe affects us here in the United States. Children are not just the foundation of our society and our future; they are truly the foundation of the future of the world. 
According to UNICEF, more than 33,000 children die each and every day; most from easily preventable diseases. The under 5 mortality rate for children in the least developed countries is 20 times greater than that of the United States and other industrialized nations. 
More than 2 million children under age 5 die each year from vaccine preventable diseases like diphtheria, measles, pertussis, polio, tuberculosis, and tetanus. Diarrhoeal diseases, often caused by a total lack of clean sanitation facilities and clean water, kill an additional 3 million children per year. And for every child that dies, several more live on with stunted growth, ill health, and diminished potential. 
The world's political leadership can ill-afford to ignore these statistics. These are just the mortality statistics for young children. Equally disturbing figures are available regarding access to education, the treatment of young girls, nutrition, and child labor. Clearly, our work on behalf of children is far from completed. While we have much to celebrate, we have much more to do. And I am delighted to be joining Senator Jeffords to unequivocally state our belief that the United States must continue to champion the future health, education, and economic well-being of children everywhere. 
Importantly, to reach children, we must reach out to the world's women including young mothers, family providers, and elders. Women are often overlooked in tradition development programs. Fortunately, the World Summit for Children recognized to improve the lot of children, the status of women also had to improve. 
For example, recognizing the important link between child survival and family planning, the World Summit for Children called for universal access to family planning education and services by the end of this decade. 
Family planning saves the lives of both women and children. We know that babies born in quick succession to a mother whose body has not yet recovered from a previous birth are the least likely to survive. Increasing funds in this area has been a top priority for me in my work in the Senate, and is addressed positively in the legislation we are introducing today. 
Basic education is another important component of this legislation. Of the 143 million children in the developing world not attending school, 56 percent are girls. Of the world's 900 million illiterate adults, nearly two thirds are women. World Bank studies have estimated that each additional year of education for a young girl results in a 10-percent decrease in birth rates and child death rates, and a 10 to 20 percent increase in wages earned. 
Foreign aid is never a popular item. I applaud Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for her advocacy work in support of foreign aid and U.S. assistance abroad. And I am pleased that the both bodies of the Congress have voted to provide additional moneys for foreign assistance in fiscal year 1998. In my view, our foreign aid dollars are best spent when we are investing in programs that strengthen families around the globe, and give a special hand to women and children. 
That is exactly what Senator Jeffords and I propose to do with the James P. Grant World's Summit for Children Implementation Act. I urge my colleagues to review and support this important legislation.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the amendment introduced by the Senator from Arkansas regarding MFN status for China. This issue is of immense importance to Washington State and the Nation. 
As a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I must state for the record that I believe that this is not the appropriate forum for this amendment. The Senator from Arkansas has chosen to spring upon the Senate--with little notice--his amendment to fundamentally alter our relationship with the world's most populous nation. 
I am sure the Senator knows that the House of Representatives recently followed the process established by the Jackson-Vanik amendment to overturn the President's decision to renew most-favored nation status for the People's Republic of China. The House of Representatives in strong bipartisan fashion rejected the effort to overturn the President of the United States. I applaud the House for taking this action. The House vote in favor of MFN followed extensive hearings, much thoughtful debate, and considerable input from our constituents, the business community, and the Clinton administration. 
While this is not a new issue to many in the Senate, the Senator from Arkansas now asks the U.S. Senate go on record on this important strategic issue on the wrong bill without the benefits of adequate debate and thorough consideration. I don't believe this is the way to make good policy, and particularly on the United States-China relationship which is perhaps the most important, most difficult and most challenging relationship for United States policy makers to manage. 
I applaud Senator Hutchison's interest in the United States-China relationship. In fact, I share many of the concerns that he in his arguments has outlined. But I differ in his prescription for addressing the problems in the United States-China relationship. I don't believe ending MFN or normal trade ties with China will advance United States interests. Rather, I believe the approach prescribed by opponents of MFN would for all intensive purposes end our relationship with China. For my State, this would be disastrous. 
Chinese students--some of whom will become future government leaders in China--will likely discontinue their studies at universities in this country including at the Henry Jackson School of International Affairs at the University of Washington. 
As many as 400 Washington State families might lose the ability to adopt a young Chinese girl in the coming year as a result of this amendment. 
The Reverend Ned Graham and his East Gates Mininstries based in Sumner, WA, could see its mission in China curtailed or possibly ended altogether. East Gates Ministries has distributed nearly 2 million Bibles printed in Chinese dialects throughout China. Other Washington State faith-based ministries are active in China and could see their activities halted if the Senate agrees to this amendment. 
I recently traveled to Hong Kong and China to discuss candidly the issues like MFN, the World Trade Organization, Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty, the trade imbalance between the United States and China, my personal concerns on human rights, and numerous other issues. 
In Hong Kong, I met with officials from the U.S. Consulate, the American Chamber of Commerce, the Hong Kong Government, and others. On the street and in official meetings, I sought to determine the mood of the people of the former British Colony prior to the reversion to Chinese sovereignty. Again and again, I was encouraged to convey to the Congress the importance of MFN to Hong Kong. Virtually every leader from Hong Kong has communicated to Congress the devastating impact that MFN revocation would have on the island recently named the freest economy in the world. 
In my view, it is important for all who want to influence change in China to recognize that Hong Kong's transition may be our best opportunity to further influence the mainland in such important areas as the rule of law, respect for individual rights, and the many democratic principles that we cherish in the United States. 
In Beijing, I met with China's Vice Premier, Chinese Trade Ministry officials, and Chinese leaders involved in financial services, transportation, agriculture, electronics, and aviation. I also spent a significant amount of time with U.S. Ambassador Jim Sasser, our former Senate colleague. Ambassador Sasser, who was a China critic as a member of this body, now adamantly supports the renewal of MFN status for China. 
In my meeting with Vice Premier Li Lanqing, I focused on the trade imbalance between the United States and China, my concerns and those of my constituents on human rights, and the importance of China abiding by its commitments to Hong Kong. 
I also discussed the Chinese counterparts many other issues important to us, including the growth of the Internet in China, the competitive advantage of Washington State's ports and transportation infrastructure, the future energy needs of China, food security issues, including China's ability to feed its own people, problems associated with large, unproductive state-owned enterprises and growth patterns in coastal and rural parts of China. 
My point in discussing my trip to China tonight is quite simple: If the Senate adopts the Hutchinson amendment, it will have disastrous consequences on the United States-China relationship. I believe it will threaten our very ability to dialog with the Chinese on all of the issues I have just outlined. 
If the opponents of MFN truly believe the Senate must go on record on this issue, so be it. Let's do it in a responsible fashion with the proper consideration that an issue of this importance merits. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote against the Hutchinson amendment. I believe it is unwise and irresponsible for the Senate to address this issue in this fashion.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, as a member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I want to commend both Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy. Once again, the leadership of the subcommittee has produced a bill that I am sure will be widely and bipartisanly supported by the Senate. 
I also want to take this opportunity to commend Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The Secretary appeared before the subcommittee to explain and justify the administration's increased request for this bill. But she went further than this, further than her Democratic and Republican predecessors at the State Department. Secretary Albright has taken the case for foreign aid and the work of this subcommittee directly to the American people. She has done a remarkable job conveying to our constituents the benefits to the American people of our role in the world and the importance of continued U.S. leadership abroad. 
The foreign operations, export financing, and related programs Appropriations bill provides monies to meet a great number of important policy initiatives. I want to use my time today to draw attention to just a few of the important initiatives. 
Importantly and with my full support, this bill fully funds the Administration's assistance request for our democratic ally Israel. I visited Israel late last year with a delegation of my constituents. It was my first trip to the Middle East. The trip was a wonderful experience that has benefited me personally and professionally as I approach my work at the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. I met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with the chief Palestinian negotiator, and with the Norweigian diplomats who negotiated the Oslo accords. I met with the Ambassador to Israel, toured important historic and cultural sites, and stood atop the Golan Heights. More than ever, I am convinced that the foreign assistance moneys provided by this legislation to Israel and in support of the peace process are warranted and of strategic importance to the United States. 
This bill is also a key tool in our efforts to increase U.S. exports and to generate new jobs all across the country. The provisions of this bill providing moneys for the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Trade Development Agency are vitally important to my constituents. A recent 1997 study titled, `Foreign Exports and the Washington State Economy,' concluded that `no state derives more economic benefit from the production of goods and services for the foreign markets that Washington State.' Shortly after the turn of the century, one in three Washington State jobs will be reliant upon international trade. Jobs related to trade in my state also paid wages 46 percent higher than the State average. These trade promotion programs are priority issues for me and I am pleased that we've met the administration's request for these programs. In the case of the Ex-Im Bank, the subcommittee has exceeded the administration's request. 
Another key component of this bill is our assistance program to Russia and the newly independent states. This assistance is as important as any granted by the United States. It is a small price to pay to ensure that the trillions of dollars spent on the cold war does not go to waste. Certainly there are problems on the ground in Russia and the NIS countries; religious persecution, political and economic corruption, weapons proliferation and environmental pollution to name just a few. The United States must be diligent in tackling these problems as they arise in our continuing efforts to promote and support democracy. 
I am particularly interested in our efforts to increase and highlight the linkages between the Russian Far East and the west coast of the United States. Washington State is as involved in the Russian Far East as any State in the country. Chairman Stevens is also personally very knowledgeable about the importance of this region as Alaska also maintains many direct ties to the Russian Far East. 
The Committee bill also contains many important provisions to children. It contains funding for UNICEF and other child survival programs. Our bill provides moneys to educate young girls as well as provide microcredit loans to young families and women in the developing world. These funds make an enormous difference in the lives of millions of children and families in the world. 
I have touched on just a few of the the provisions within this important bill. Again, I want to thank the manager's for bringing this legislation to the Senate today. And I encourage my colleagues to support the foreign operations legislation.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last Monday I introduced an amendment that could have helped ensure this bill is not vetoed by President Clinton because it violates the bipartisan budget agreement. Today, we have reached agreement on that amendment--but it does not go nearly far enough. 
Let me lay out what this defense authorization bill does in very large terms. This bill adds $5.1 billion to the Pentagon's request. It does this by moving $2.4 billion from defense-related activities of the Energy Department to the Defense Department--primarily in procurement and R&D. The two Energy programs hardest hit are privatization of cleanup efforts and forward funding of asset acquisition. 
My amendment sought to restore some of the privatization money because we have a huge problem at the Hanford Reservation that could be solved with this new funding. We have 177-million-gallon tanks filled with chemical and high-level radioactive waste located near the Columbia River. The environmental devastation at Hanford and other former defense nuclear sites is truly mind-numbing. We must clean up the mess we have made. Privatization offers us an opportunity to do that and reduce costs and increase efficiency. 
My amendment sought to restore $300 million of the $1 billion the President sought in this one-time shot in the arm of the environmental management program. Instead, I was successful in securing only $59.7 million, making the amount this bill funds only $274.7 million. This is a tremendous shortfall and could result in the Federal Government missing legally enforceable cleanup milestones. 
Mr. President, the House defense authorization bill is even worse--funding the entire privatization program at only $70 million. Our Senate conferees must insist we keep the entire amount we have in this bill. Senator Gorton and I have the commitment of Sen. Thurmond that the conferees will do that. 
On the appropriations front, I was able to secure an extra $43 million yesterday in the Senate energy and water development appropriations bill. The privatization account increased from $300 million to $343 million. Again, the House is rumored to be far, far lower--and the appropriation's conferees will have a difficult job ahead to keep even these greatly diminished funds. 
We made a huge mess at Hanford while we were fighting and winning the cold war. Now we must pay the debt the federal government owes to these cold warrior communities. And this bill takes a small step--but just doesn't do the job. However, I do want to thank the committee for accepting my amendment and I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member to ensure these numbers remain in the bill this Congress sends to the President.

Mrs. MURRAY. I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Snowe, Senator Kennedy, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Robb, and Senator Wyden. 
Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment simply strikes the existing ban on privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals for military personnel and dependents. For the information of my colleagues, it is identical to the amendment that I offered last Congress which was adopted by the Senate. 
Mr. President, it is extremely amazing to me that today a woman who volunteers to serve our country and is stationed overseas surrenders her ability to receive a safe and legal abortion without unnecessary and intrusive obstacles. 
Not only are female military personnel denied this basic reproductive health service, but so are dependents of military personnel. 
Mr. President, I know that my colleagues share my concerns regarding current allegations of sexual harassment against women in the military. We all agree this is intolerable and cannot and will not be accepted. We are all committed to protecting women from sexual harassment or discrimination while serving in the military. We all recognize that serving one's country does not mean sacrificing one's civil and constitutional rights. 
While the military may have a separate code of conduct, basic civil rights are afforded all military personnel. It is important for me to stress this to my colleagues. No Senator would come to the floor to support any legislation that eliminated constitutional guarantees for military personnel. However, that is exactly what happens today unless we lift the current ban on access to safe and legal abortion services for military personnel serving overseas. 
In 1993, the ban on privately funded abortion services for military personnel and independents was lifted, restoring basic health care protection to all women serving overseas. Unfortunately, in the 1996 Department of Defense Authorization Act, this ban was reinstated. I was at a loss then and I still am today as to what the justification is for this ban. 
I have heard supporters of the ban talk about the use of Federal funds to provide abortion-related services. Mr. President, this argument is weak at best. My amendment would require that personal funds be used. The cost to the patient to provide abortion services far exceed the cost of the procedure itself. 
Mr. President, without my amendment, we subject women to undue hardships when they serve overseas. If a woman serving overseas cannot obtain a legal and safe abortion at her own expense, she must request leave from her commanding officer to fly back to the United States for this procedure. We should be outraged at the cost to the military for transporting her back to the United States and for the leave time that must be granted. Why is it better to pay for these costs than simply to have the woman pay for the procedure at her own expense at a safe U.S. military hospital? 
Based on this fact, the argument that it costs Federal tax dollars to provide abortion-related services to military personnel cannot be the issue. Today, it takes more tax dollars to provide a safe and legal abortion for military personnel than it would under my amendment. If anyone is concerned about Federal tax dollars funding abortion, they should support my amendment, as it would require the woman to pay for the procedure with private funds where she is stationed rather than flying her home to the United States. 
Supporters of the ban may also claim that military medical personnel should not be trained to perform or counsel on abortion-related services. I remind my colleagues, however, current law provides coverage for abortions in the case of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the woman. Doctors must now be trained, regardless of what happens here today. 
Let me respond as well to statements that insist that this amendment would require any doctor to perform an elective abortion, regardless of their own personal objections. This amendment does not change or impact current DOD policy which 
clearly spells out that health care providers who, as a matter of conscience or moral principle, do not wish to perform elective abortions, shall not be required to do so. The DOD policy and the conscience clause enforced by all four branches of the service have worked. There have been no reported cases of a military doctor being forced to perform an elective abortion despite their moral or ethical objections. 
Mr. President, like all of our service personnel, women in the military deserve our utmost respect, honor, and gratitude. They certainly do not deserve to be told that they must check their constitutional rights at the door when they are stationed overseas. This amendment protects their precious rights and ensures their safe access to quality medical services. 
Like all military personnel, women should be guaranteed access to quality and safe medical services. The current ban on abortion services at DOD facilities could force women to seek unsafe, back-alley abortions in a foreign country. Without adequate care, an abortion can be life-threatening or permanently disabling. 
Mr. President, we often have Members come to the floor to advocate for women's health issues. I remind my colleagues that forcing a woman to delay an abortion could further jeopardize her health. Every week a woman has to wait increases the health risks. It is simply wrong to jeopardize the health and well-being of our military personnel. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Murray-Snowe amendment and to give every woman in the military the same rights, the same rights, that are afforded every other American woman. This is our chance to show women in the military and dependents serving overseas that we do care and that we appreciate their contributions to protecting our national security. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me make this very clear again. Today, if a woman serving overseas--whether she is in Bosnia or Saudi Arabia--would like to have health services, she would have to go through a commanding officer and request permission to come home to the United States to have that procedure take place, and at the taxpayers' expense they would fly her home. Under my amendment she would be allowed to use her own money to pay for abortion-related services in a military hospital overseas. 
I think that is a reasonable request for those women that we ask to serve in a country far away from home. 
Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from California.

Mrs. MURRAY. Let me just end this debate by reiterating for my colleagues that today a woman who seeks reproductive health services has to ask her commanding officer and be flown home at taxpayer expense on one of our transports in order to receive reproductive health services. Under my amendment, she will be able to pay for it at her own cost in a safe military hospital overseas. The bottom line is this is about the basic rights of those women whom we are asking to serve in remote locations to protect this democracy and fight for our country and for other countries overseas to be given the right to reproductive health care services.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to speak on amendment No. 424 to the defense authorization legislation that was proposed yesterday by my colleague, Senator Gorton. I am a cosponsor of this amendment to require the Navy to reopen the selection process for the donation of the USS Missouri. 
From the beginning, I have followed closely the Navy's handling of the Missouri, working with Senator Gorton, Congressman Norm Dicks, the Washington congressional delegation, and my constituents. The `Mighty Mo' is a relic of immense importance and historical significance. It was on the decks of this great battleship that World War II came to a welcome end. 
The Missouri is particularly valued by the residents of my home State where she has been berthed for most of the last 40 years in Bremerton. She is a source of great pride to the veterans in my State, many of whom served in World War II, including in the Pacific theater and aboard the Missouri. 
I have reviewed yesterday's debate over the amendment, and I want to take this opportunity to make several additional remarks for the Record. 
I first want to commend both Senator Gorton and Senator Inouye. The debate was indicative of the immense interest in the Missouri and all of the States that competed for the honor of displaying this important piece of our history. 
While I cannot speak for the other applicants, I know of the care, the time, and the commitment demonstrated by the Bremerton, WA, community in preparing its proposal to the Navy. Bremerton, Kitsap County and Washington State have developed a kinship with the `Mighty Mo.' It is because of this kinship with the battleship, and our 40-year record of paying tribute to the Missouri each and every day, that I continue to believe that Bremerton is the ideal home for the Missouri. 
Last August, the Secretary of the Navy announced the decision to award the Missouri to Honolulu, HI. Following the Navy's decision, significant questions were raised regarding the Navy's process in awarding the battleship. It is those questions, including a General Accounting Office report, that brings me here today to seek the Senate's support for our amendment to reopen the Missouri donee selection process. 
I want to reiterate what our amendment seeks to accomplish. We simply seek only the Senate's support to instruct the Navy to conduct a new donee selection process. We do not seek to influence or prejudge that selection process. We only want a fair competition administered by the Navy in a manner worthy of this great battleship. 
I recognize that the Navy is under no obligation to conduct a competition for important relics like the Missouri, but the fact is the Navy did conduct a competition for the Missouri. Having conducted this competition, I think it is only fair to the competing communities to expect the Navy to conduct itself in an aboveboard and a forthright manner. 
Clearly, significant mistakes were made by the Navy in the Missouri competition. The GAO report clearly identifies the Navy's numerous shortcomings in this competition. Proponents and opponents can and do differ over whether the Navy's handling of the competition influenced the outcome. But I find it very difficult to conclude that all communities were treated fairly by the Navy. And that is what we are asking for today. It really is just a simple matter of fairness for all of the competing communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton-Murray-Feinstein amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Washington State colleague in offering this amendment to require the Navy to revisit the awarding of the U.S.S. Missouri. I have followed closely the Navy's handling of the Missouri; working with Senator Gorton, Congressman Norm Dicks, the Washington congressional delegation, and my constituents. I am also pleased that California Senators have joined this effort to question the Navy's Missouri decision. 
The history of the `Mighty Mo' is known all across our country and throughout the world. This is a relic of immense importance and historical significance. It was on the decks of this great battleship that World War II came to a welcome end. The Missouri is particularly valued by the residents of my State where she has been berthed for most of the last 40 years in Bremerton. She is a source of great pride to veterans in my State; many of whom served in World War II including in the Pacific theater and aboard the `Mighty Mo.' 
Following the Navy's decision to remove the Missouri from the Naval Vessel Register, five proposals were submitted to the Navy from communities interested in taking ownership of the famed battleship. Bremerton, WA was among the five applicants seeking to display and honor the Missouri. San Diego, San Francisco and Honolulu all submitted proposals. 
Each community vying for the Missouri submitted voluminous applications to the Navy responding within a year's time to a set of Navy criteria previously used in the disposition of the U.S.S. Lexington. While I cannot speak for the other applicants, I know of the care, the time, and the commitment demonstrated by the Bremerton community in preparing its proposal to the Navy. Bremerton's proposal to permanently display the Missouri was delivered to the Navy in October 1995. 
Last August, the Secretary of the Navy announced the decision to award the Missouri to Honolulu, HI. Following the Navy's decision, significant questions were raised regarding the Navy's process in awarding the battleship. Congressman Norm Dicks in his capacity as a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee requested a General Accounting Office study on the Navy's donation process of the Missouri. 
It is the results of this GAO study that bring us here today. Since coming to the Congress, I have sought to let the Sun shine on the political process--to share with the public the great decisions before this body. The GAO study demonstrates that the Navy also needs a little sunshine. 
Here's what the GAO found in reviewing the Navy process. Following the review of applications, the Navy added new and previously unused criteria to the selection process. And, according to the GAO, the Navy did not do a good job communicating the relative importance of the new evaluation criteria. According to the GAO, several of the applicants reported that the Navy gave them the mistaken impression that the additional requirements were not that significant. 
Shockingly, these new criteria were actually given 75 percent of the donation award weight. After more than 1 year of discussion among the interested communities, the Navy changed the rules and failed to explain the importance of the new rules. Then the Navy gave the competing communities 12 days to respond to the new rules which turned out to be decisive in awarding the battleship. 
Clearly, the Navy bungled the process--either innocently or with other motives in mind. I am not here to accuse either the Navy or another applicant of behaving inappropriately. Rather, I do believe the facts of the case as established by the GAO argue for our amendment. 
Let me state clearly what our amendment seeks to accomplish today. We simply seek the Senate's support to instruct the Navy to conduct a new donee selection process. We do not seek to influence or prejudge that selection process. We only want a fair competition, administered by the Navy in a manner worthy of this great battleship. 
Like all of my colleagues interested in displaying the Missouri, I have every confidence in the proposal from my home State. Bremerton continues to host the Missouri today and the community is devoted to remaining the steward of this unique historic monument. The Missouri is a passion for the residents of Bremerton, Kitsap County, and indeed all of Washington State. 
I recognize that the interests of Washington State may not be enough to sway the Senate to overturn the Navy's decision. However, I do want my colleagues to know that this is not a small, regional competition. Veterans all across this country care about the Missouri. Those who served aboard this great battleship live in every State in the country; many are now elderly and incapable of traveling great distances to commemorate their service. It is for our veterans and particularly for those that served aboard the `Mighty Mo' that we must ensure that the process is fair to all. 
All World War II vets recognize and revere the `Mighty Mo.' Just recently, Bremerton hosted a group of 110 families and survivors from the Death March of Bataan and Corregidor. These veterans, many in poor health, could travel to Bremerton. And they wanted to see the `Mighty Mo.' This reverence for the battleship demands that the Senate stand for a process fair to all. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton-Murray amendment.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a country we have congratulated ourselves time and time again on our enormous victory in winning the cold war. But today I want to remind my colleagues that the cold war was won at a cost, a very steep cost, and one of the biggest debts owed remains unpaid: the environmental devastation created at places like Hanford Nuclear Reservation in south-central Washington State. 
Later today, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee will mark up its fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. We will have a lot of work to do to make up the shortfalls found in both the Senate Armed Services defense authorization bill and the House national defense authorization bill. Rather than funding the cleanup bills, the authorizing committees have taken nearly $1 billion--billion--from the defense environmental management accounts of the Department of Energy and moved them into procurement and other Department of Defense accounts. 
Let me tell you the effect this move will have on one place in my State. Probably the single biggest environmental problem on any of our former defense nuclear weapons sites is the 177 storage tanks filled with chemical and high-level radioactive waste at Hanford. Each of these tanks contains from a half million to a million gallons of toxic waste. Some of that waste is rock solid, some of it is soupy sludge, some of it is liquid, and some is poisonous gas. Several tanks have `burped' their noxious gases. 
We have only recently begun making real progress in learning what chemicals and radioactive waste were put into these tanks and what substances have now been created through indiscriminate mixing of wastes. 
The most troubling aspect of these tanks is that they are leaking, moving these vile substances into ground water and toward the Columbia River. 
Let me say it again. These tanks are leaking, and they are located next to one of this Nation's greatest rivers. They are upstream from Richland, Kennewick, Pasco, Portland, and many smaller communities in Washington and Oregon. 
And their toxic waste is slowly migrating toward the Columbia River, which many view as the lifeblood of the Pacific Northwest because it provides fish, irrigation, power generation, recreation, and much more. 
In this year's budget, the Department of Energy requested $427 million in budget authority to continue a privatization initiative, called the tank waste remediation system, and another $500 million plus for other environmental management privatization efforts. My colleague in the Washington delegation, Representative Adam Smith, was successful in getting the House National Security Committee to place $70 million in the defense authorization bill for tank waste, nearly $350 million short of the budget request, but the House gave no other sites any funds. Our Senate Armed Services Committee bill provides $215 million for four privatization projects, including $109 million targeted to tank waste. This is simply not adequate. 
Yesterday, I submitted an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill that would increase these privatization accounts by about $250 million. Most of that money goes toward solving the tank waste problem which almost everyone familiar with this issue agrees must be our top priority, but money is also added at Savannah River, Oak Ridge, Idaho Falls, and Fernald. 
In addition, my amendment would facilitate the riskiest part of this privatization venture by helping to ensure DOE is able to meet its time lines for delivery of this toxic waste to a private company for vitrification or immobilization. I added $50 million for this initial stage of characterization and remediation of the tank waste. The offsets come from noncleanup programs and another privatization effort within the Departments of Energy and Defense. 
Mr. President, I am talking about deadly risks to human health and the environment, and so far, this Congress is choosing to ignore them. Simply wishing that these enormously costly projects will go away will not make them disappear. It will only make them worse and more costly to clean up later. 
The Department of Energy has proposed an innovative method of solving these problems by privatizing them and letting some of the best, most established companies in the world use their expertise to clean up these sites. In order for industry to succeed, this Congress must demonstrate its commitment to the privatization program by funding it. Going from a Presidential request of $1 billion to $70 million in the House and $215 million in the Senate will not give the capital markets or private industry the confidence they need to make this work. 
We need more money for the tank waste remediation system and other cleanup priorities. Let me remind my colleagues that even if my amendment prevails, this authorization bill will still contain about $500 million less than was agreed upon by the President and Congress in the recent historic budget agreement. The President finds this funding shortfall so serious that he has issued veto threats on both defense authorization bills, citing this as one of his primary concerns. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with me as we work to get our former defense nuclear weapons sites restored or at least stop them from causing further harm to our rivers, our air and our land. We cannot turn our backs on the nearby communities that have sacrificed so much for this Nation in the past. Let's make our victory of the cold war complete by leaving our children and our grandchildren a safe, healthy environment, not a contaminated wasteland that sites, like Hanford, will become without sufficient Federal cleanup dollars. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today the Senate completed action on S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, legislation implementing the tax relief provisions from the historic bipartisan balanced budget agreement. I support this legislation because it does provide real tax relief and adheres to the balanced budget agreement, which we worked hard to achieve. American families need this tax relief and they need our continued commitment to a balanced budget. 
I have listened to the concerns of many of my colleagues regarding this legislation and the benefits for working families. There is no disputing the fact that this legislation does benefit upper income families, but it also benefits working families and the tax cuts are not at the expense of vital, investment programs. I have heard a great deal about the inequities in this legislation and I supported the Daschle substitute which would have eliminated many of these inequities. But, I do think it is unfair to make the criticism without examining the entire balanced budget agreement and the tax relief adopted in 1993 for struggling, working families. The bottom line is that working families will benefit from estate tax relief, capital gains tax reductions, education investment tax credits, a per child tax credit and expanded IRAs. 
Beyond taxes, my colleagues must remember that the balanced budget agreement was not only about tax relief, but it was also about helping working families by allocating additional resources for health care, education, environmental protection, and nutritional assistance. It also protected Social Security and Medicare for our Nation's senior citizens. Before weighing any inequities, let's make sure we examine the complete picture. 
The balanced budget agreement, which this body adopted on June 5, 1997, calls for a significant investment in education. The agreement assumes additional Federal funding for important programs aimed at improving access to quality education for our children. I can assure my colleagues that working families will benefit from improved educational opportunities for their children. Quality education is one of the major priorities for many of the constituents that I talk to in Washington State. And again, there are education tax incentives which will help middle class working families who are facing escalating tuition and higher education costs. The Hope tax credits and the permanent extension of section 127 employer-provided educational assistance tax exemption are the kind of tax relief that my constituents have endorsed. 
There is no doubt that this legislation can and should be perfected. We can work to target more relief to the middle class and I will be seeking these changes in conference. I am also hopeful we guarantee that these tax cuts do not result in an explosion in the deficit. I will not sit by and watch our deficit run out of control. When I first came to the Senate in 1993, the deficit was close to $300 billion annually. For 1997, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that our deficit could be as low as $70 billion. This was not done without some pain and sacrifice. It is imperative that we stay the course and maintain a balanced budget well after 2002. 
Now that the Senate has completed action on part II of the budget agreement, I sincerely hope that every effort will be made to correct the problems with S. 947, the spending reconciliation legislation. The Medicare provisions added by the Senate Finance Committee go well beyond protecting Medicare and will jeopardize access to health care for millions of low income senior citizens. I supported a balanced budget agreement that included constraints on spending and tax relief. It is imperative that we enact both parts of the bi-partisan balanced budget agreement, and I will be making every effort to improve S. 947 in conference and I will continue to oppose efforts that seek to undermine the historic, bipartisan balanced budget agreement.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a Member of the Senate Budget Committee, I have spent the last four months in ongoing negotiations working towards the enactment of a real, balanced budget plan. I was part of the bipartisan negotiations that resulted in the historic balanced budget agreement. Getting to this agreement was not an easy task, but I realized that the need to get to balance was critical. I negotiated in good faith and believed that the final product was an equitable, fiscally sound agreement that did balance the budget without jeopardizing vital programs. 
The agreement ensured the continued solvency of Medicare. It guaranteed that Medicare would remain an affordable health insurance program that provided quality health care for millions of senior citizens. The agreement also allowed for an expansion of health insurance for 10 million children that have no health insurance. It called for the largest investment in education in over 30 years and it would provide real tax relief for working families. While I still had some reservations about the agreement, I supported the package because I knew that in any good faith negotiation one can never expect to win on all points. It was not a perfect agreement and as I have said in the past, it is not the one that I would have produced. But, it was a bipartisan, fiscally sound balanced budget agreement. 
The agreement called for $204 billion in net deficit reduction. This would be in addition to the over $200 billion in deficit reduction already accomplished as a result of the 1993 deficit reduction package. The agreement built on this successful deficit reduction package which resulted in 4 straight years of declining deficits. In 1993, the annual Federal deficit was close to $300 billion, for 1997 the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the deficit could fall to $70 billion. I was proud to be part of this deficit reduction effort and believed that we could get our fiscal house in order. 
Following passage of S. Con. Res. 27, the FY98 Budget Resolution, which incorporated the balanced budget agreement, I was hopeful that a fair, equitable and fiscally sound balanced budget would be in place by the end of the year. I negotiated in good faith; I agreed to adhere to the agreement; and I was of the belief that my colleagues would do the same. 
Unfortunately, the reconciliation spending measure adopted by the Senate, violates this bipartisan agreement. But, more importantly, it violates the commitment I made to my constituents when I was elected to the U.S. Senate. 
One of the commitments I made to the people of Washington State was to work to expand affordable health care for all Americans. I am proud of the steps we have taken to improve access to health care for more Americans. Unfortunately, included in this reconciliation 
legislation is a provision that will deny affordable, quality health insurance for those Americans age 65 to 67. Increasing the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67 will deny affordable, quality health insurance for millions of Americans. I cannot in all good conscience support legislation that increases the number of uninsured Americans. We should be looking to reduce the numbers of Americans with no health security, not adding to it. 
I did not come to this decision without a great deal of thought. I have listened to the debate on both sides of these issues. I cannot help but think about the impact that these provisions will have on senior citizens who have worked hard all of their lives and are now facing escalating health care costs and limited retirement income. I only need to think about my own parents to truly understand what these changes mean to our senior citizens. When my father was diagnosed with M.S. my parents saw their insurance deductibles increase to $2,000 a piece overnight. Their premiums also increased dramatically every year. There was nothing that they could do as there were no other available health insurance plans that would cover my father. They were struggling to simply make their insurance payments and other basic life necessities. My father was desperate to turn 65 because he was not sure how much longer he could afford insurance or how much longer they would cover him. An additional two more years of skyrocketing premiums and deductibles would have financially devastated my parents. My father may have lost his insurance if he had to wait two additional years. He would have lost access to effective therapies for treating MS and slowing the progress of this crippling illness. As it was I know that there were times when my parents feared going to the doctors because of the impact on their deductible and premiums. Is this what we want for our parents? 
My parents knew that once they reached 65 they would have some guarantee of affordable, quality health insurance. Prior to this, there simply was no guarantee. They knew that prior to 65 that were one illness away from financial disaster. If we act to increase the eligibility age to 67 there will be those seniors who face an even worse fate and will be at the mercy of insurance companies. They will see their retirement security jeopardized and their access to preventive health care gone. We should be encouraging greater access to preventive health care as it controls long term health care costs. Increasing the age to 67 will only make people sicker and poorer. I cannot support this type of outcome. 
There is another troubling provision within the reconciliation package which, I might add was only introduced yesterday and was not part of the balanced budget agreement. With less than 24 hours to consider the implications, the Senate is ready to means test Part B premiums. Medicare premiums could climb to over $2,000 for senior citizens earning more than $50,000. The Social Security Administration would now have to know the exact income of every beneficiary for any given month. 
The administrative burdens alone warrant further Congressional review. Additionally, adding to the cost of the administration of Social Security represents a direct attack on the Social Security Trust Fund. The means testing as proposed in the reconciliation package that the Senate adopted is unworkable. 
There are simply too many questions regarding these provisions. We need more time and 
debate before we act to radically alter Medicare. Medicare remains one of the most successful anti-poverty programs ever adopted by Congress. The popularity of this program speaks to the success of the program and the success of efforts to ensure health care security for our senior citizens. Enacting an increase in the eligibility age and means testing Part B premiums will do little to address the long term financial solvency issues. What it will do is undermine our commitment to senior citizens and jeopardize the success of the Medicare program. 
We all know that real Medicare reforms are necessary. When the so-called baby boom generation begins to retire there will be a significant increase in Medicare enrollees. I am ready to face the challenge of enacting real comprehensive Medicare reforms. However, I am concerned that these two provisions including in the reconciliation package are being offered as some kind of panacea to real reform and will do little to address long term solvency concerns. Increasing the age for Medicare eligibility and the means testing proposal will do little to control Medicare costs, they will, however, devastate millions of senior citizens. This reconciliation bill is not the appropriate venue for significant Medicare changes. Reforming any program that serves over 33 million Americans requires a more cautious and thorough process. 
I came to the debate hoping that at the very least we would remove these two provisions from the legislation. I supported amendment that would have conformed this reconciliation bill to the equitable provisions included in the balanced budget agreement. It now appears that this is unlikely and these two provisions will remain in the bill. I could not support any legislation that would jeopardize affordable, quality health care for millions of senior citizens. 
It is truly unfortunate that we were not successful in eliminating these provisions as there are many aspects of this legislation that do adhere to the balanced budget agreement and could have positive fiscal, economic and social ramifications. But, I had to send the message that I could not support any legislation that jeopardizes Medicare. 
It is difficult for me to vote no on this entire reconciliation package. This legislation will fix the devastating impact of welfare reform for disabled, low-income, legal immigrants. It provides an additional $16 billion for children's health care initiatives. It allows for an expansion of prevention benefits for Medicare beneficiaries. I am also pleased that the Managers accepted my amendment to clarify that States can waive victims of domestic violence from the punitive welfare reform requirements. I am grateful to the Chairman of the Budget Committee for accepting this important amendment and am disappointed that I cannot support the overall package. 
I know that there is a very good chance that these problems could be addressed in Conference as they are not currently included in the reconciliation bill passed in the House. I will make every effort to ensure that these provisions do not survive Conference. I believe that if we can get back to the bipartisan agreement and good faith negotiations, we can still send to the President a balanced budget agreement that he can sign. If we have learned nothing else over the last two years, I sincerely hope that my Colleagues have learned that legislative accomplishments can only happen through honest, bipartisan efforts. 
I reluctantly voted no on this reconciliation bill. I want my Colleagues to know that this bill is unacceptable and violates the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. If we can work in Conference to improve the bill and correct the unnecessary Medicare provisions I believe we would have a good balanced budget plan. I urge my Colleagues to put aside their philosophical differences and work to enact the historic balanced budget agreement.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I make a point of order that section 1949(a)(2) of this act violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act. 
Mr. President, as an appropriator, I object to the language included in this legislation by the Finance Committee that would make permanent a prohibition against Medicaid managed care funds being used for abortion services except in the cases of rape, incest, or where the woman's life is in danger. This is, for all intents and purposes, a permanent extension of the so-called Hyde amendment that has been included in every Labor-HHS and education appropriations bill since 1987. A reconciliation bill is not the proper vehicle for major abortion policy decisions. This is not how Congress has traditionally dealt with such decisions, and this is not how we should begin to deal with such decisions. 
I know that some of my colleagues disagree----

Mr. President, I withdraw my previous point of order, but I want this body to know that I object to the language in this bill that essentially makes Hyde permanent and affects those States whose managed care plans now cover medically necessary abortions. Unfortunately, the way the language was cleverly drafted, my point of order would have unintended consequences. 
I go back to what my colleague from West Virginia said to all of us a few minutes ago. I think as we move toward final passage, I hope we all understand the severe consequences of the many different arenas in this bill. 
I withdraw my point of order.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today the Budget Committee is scheduled to report out the budget reconciliation spending bill. Unfortunately, I was unable to be present for the final vote, but had I been here I would have voted `aye.' 
Several months ago I made a commitment to the graduating class at North Seattle Community College that I would be honored to be their 1997 commencement speaker. This commitment was extremely important to me and the graduating class, I simply could not back out at the last minute. Today's Budget Committee mark up was not finalized until last night. 
I am extremely troubled by some of the provisions within the reconciliation package as I believe that they violate the bipartisan balanced budget agreement that was recently adopted. I am also disappointed that the committee will not have final legislative language and final CBO numbers on parts of the Finance Committee sections. It is difficult to understand why the leadership is in such a rush to complete action on major changes to Medicare and Medicaid. This rush to bring this bill to the floor does jeopardize our efforts to enact a balanced budget. 
As we all know the Budget Committee cannot amend the reconciliation legislation. This will be done on the floor next week. At that time I will be supporting amendments that ensure this package is in compliance with the agreement and that it does not violate our commitment to our Nation's senior citizens and our children. We must seize on this unique opportunity to balance the budget, reform Medicare and expand health benefits for children. Unfortunately, as it stands now it does not appear that the current reconciliation language will achieve these goals. 
Today's action by the Budget Committee is an important step in the process which is why I would have voted to report the measure to the full Senate. This does not mean that the package is one I will support when it reaches the floor. I am simply acting to move us closer to achieving a balanced budget. 
I am disappointed that this legislation does violate the agreement that we worked so hard to achieve. But, I am hopeful that significant improvements will be made on the floor and that we can sent to the President a bill that he can sign.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this weekend the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is going to hold a field hearing in Mattawa, WA. We will discuss S. 200, my legislation to designate the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River as a wild and scenic river. 
The Hanford Reach is the last free-flowing stretch of this mighty river. Protecting it for future generations is a top priority for me. 
In 1995, I convened a group of local citizens, and I asked them to help me find the best way to protect this portion of the Columbia River. They unanimously concluded an act of Congress designating the reach as a wild and scenic river, with a recreational classification, would be the best way to preserve this valuable resource. 
In fact, a poll of registered voters in central Washington done last year indicated that 76 percent favored designation of the Hanford Reach as a wild and scenic river, while only 11 percent opposed it. So the will of the region is clear: The reach needs the best protection we can give it to make sure it remains accessible to everyone. 
Protecting the Hanford Reach is not about local versus Federal control. It is about giving a natural treasure the best possible protection that we can. And it is also about promoting jobs in the long term and protecting our heritage. 
What does the designation do? First, it puts central Washington on the map as a home to a resource found nowhere else on Earth--a river unique and important enough to become part of the U.S. national wild and scenic river system. Second, it protects the river in its current condition. It allows all of the existing uses to continue, but ensures the river stays forever the way we see it today. In fact, my bill specifically grandfathers in current uses protecting existing economic interests and enhancing the river's future economic value to our region. 
There is much more at stake here than who manages the river. This issue is much bigger than that. We all know what problem we have with protecting salmon. ESA listings have been made for the Snake River and are being considered for the Columbia. If we ever want to get ahead of the salmon problem, we have to start by protecting the reach. My bill gives us a cheap and easy way to do just that. It simply transfers Federal property from one agency to another; no private lands need to be acquired or jeopardized. 
Let me reiterate, we simply can't afford to take chances with the one part of the river that works well--and inexpensively--for fish. Compared to drawdowns, dam removal and other suggestions that we have heard for saving salmon, permanent protection of the reach gives ratepayers, river users and irrigators a virtually cost-free way of accomplishing what could be a very expensive recovery effort. 
We have done a lot of talking about the reach, and I am convinced that we are getting closer. It seems to me when you have a resource that is this important to the State, reasonable people ought to be able to find a way to agree on the best way to protect it. I am committed to bringing people together around that goal and keeping them together until we finish the job. 
Mr. President, I look forward to hearing the testimony this weekend, and I thank my senior colleague, Senator Gorton, for helping me put this hearing together. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to recognize Bellevue Police Department Officer Bob Oliver for his selection as Washington State D.A.R.E. Officer of the Year. 
Our children are our greatest resource and our future prosperity depends on them becoming contributing members of the community. Giving them the skills to success is no easy task, yet it is our responsibility as adults to ensure that our children have the best chance possible to succeed. The D.A.R.E. Program gives them that chance. D.A.R.E. equips each participant with the skills to just say no to peer pressure when confronted with the temptation to use drugs. It reinforces the importance of self-esteem and the consequences of one's actions, lessons which will help the children confront problems of any sort their entire lives. 
Through his active participation in the D.A.R.E. Program, Officer Oliver has demonstrated his special commitment to these children. As a police officer, Officer Oliver has dedicated his career to making his community a safer place to live. Through his participation in the D.A.R.E. Program and with his focus on prevention, his work not only makes a difference today, but will have a lasting impact. 
Some take measure of a good police officer by the numbers of arrests made or traffic violations ticketed. Officer Oliver can measure his success by the many children whose lives he has touched and positively influenced through the D.A.R.E. Program and the high esteem in which he is held in the community. 
As his family and colleagues gather to recognize him for this achievement, I want to wish him continued success. Officer Bob Oliver is truly an asset to our community, and we all congratulate him on a job well done.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my colleagues as an original cosponsor of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act of 1997. I speak as a strong supporter of this legislation, because I have always believed that every single American deserves fair treatment under the law no matter their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation. 
As one of only a few women to ever serve in the U.S. Senate, and the first ever from Washington State, I understand what it means to be part of a group that seeks fairness and equal opportunity. I have never advocated for any special protection or special class, just equal treatment and protection under the law. 
Not long ago, many thought it would be impossible for women to serve in the Senate, much less elected office of any kind. It was felt that this was not a suitable occupation for a woman and that by simply being a woman, meant you were incapable of meeting the demands of the job. It was alleged that women would take offense to the unpleasant world of politics and that the presence of women would somehow jeopardize the work done in the U.S. Congress. While these statements may seem impossible to believe today, they do illustrate what many women faced. However, these stereotypes were overcome, and I am confident that none of my colleagues today would deny the tremendous contributions women have made here, in the House, in State and local government, and at every level of public service. 
People suffer when stereotypes based on fear or ignorance are used to justify discrimination. I do not believe elected leaders serve our country well if they deny any citizen equal opportunities and equal treatment under the law. A person's success or failure must depend on their qualifications, skills, efforts, and even luck. But, no one should be denied opportunities because of their race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. 
I am continually disappointed when I hear about cases of economic discrimination based solely on one's sexual orientation. It defies logic that in today's society any employer could refuse to hire an individual, deny them equal pay, or professional advancement and subject them to harassment simply because of their sexual orientation. We have a proud history of ensuring basic civil rights for all Americans. We have enacted landmark legislation that seeks to guarantee equal opportunity, but we have failed to ensure that these protections are extended to all Americans. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act will correct this wrong. 
As we would all agree, discrimination based on race, gender, ethnic origin, or religion is not just unfair, but illegal as well. ENDA would simply add sexual orientation to this list. It is written even more narrowly than current law, because it does not allow positive corrective actions such as quotas or other preferential treatment. All it says, is a person cannot be treated differently in any decision related to employment, based on their sexuality--whether they are heterosexual or homosexual. Mr. President, this is a reasonable expectation and in fact it has been adopted by nine States, many local governments across the country, and many Fortune 500 companies, who recognize that it simply makes good business sense to value each and every one of their employees equally. It is time our laws reflect these values as well. 
To my colleagues who believe this bill would result in increased litigation, I would ask these questions: Should we then have denied women equal rights, because it would have increased the number of cases in our courts? Should we have allowed segregation to continue because of the threat of litigation? Did the Framers of our Constitution think about caseloads in our courts when they guaranteed religious freedom? 
My answer to these questions is a strong, clear `no', and I am surprised at the arguments against this legislation. They sound hauntingly familiar to the ones we have heard in the past against allowing women, the disabled, religious members, and racial groups equal protection under the law and equal economic opportunity. 
Mr. President, this is not about one group's protection at another's expense. It is about common sense, common decency and about our fundamental values as Americans. 
To quote former Senator Barry Goldwater, `anybody who cares about real moral values understands that this is not about granting special rights, it is about protecting basic rights.' 
In the last Congress, we came within one vote of adopting this important, bi-partisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can continue our proud tradition of protecting basic civil rights and opportunity for all Americans. If we do not pass this bill, our sisters and brothers, sons and daughters will remain vulnerable to discrimination. We can do better than that.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution, which puts us on a path to a balanced budget by the year 2002. As a member of the Budget Committee, I am proud to have been a part of the process that created this agreement. While I recognize that it is not perfect and that the real work is still ahead of us, I still believe that it represents a legitimate and fair plan to ensure that we achieve a balanced budget. 
This agreement builds on the historic and successful deficit reduction package enacted in 1993, which resulted in a real reduction in the Federal deficit. This 1993 package not only brought the deficit down from a high of $290 billion in 1992 to an estimated $70 billion for 1997, but it has achieved real economic growth and expansion. 
The agreement before us today is another step in making sure that our fiscal house is in order. Developing this agreement was not an easy task, and required some tough choices, but the bipartisan approach succeeded. 
Throughout the process, significant improvements were made to the original agreement. I believe that some of these improvements are essential to protecting the integrity of the agreement. I am pleased that most of these improvements remained in agreement throughout the conference process. 
One of these improvements is an amendment that I offered to ensure that in meeting the deficit reduction target for Medicaid, the authorizing committees will not look to a per-capita cap as a mechanism for savings or for controlling future spending. I believe that this was an important message to send; a per-capita cap is not an acceptable mechanism for controlling Medicaid costs and could seriously jeopardize the quality of care for millions of children, senior citizens, and the disabled. 
Along these same lines, I was pleased to join with my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, in support of an amendment that expresses the sense of the Senate, that any changes in the Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments not jeopardize the ability of hospitals, especially children's hospitals to serve the most neediest and the most vulnerable. We have to be absolutely sure that the numbers do not drive the policy. If savings can be achieved through reforming DSH without jeopardizing access 
to quality health care for the most needy than these policy changes should be considered. But, if the motive is simply a number and develop the policy around the cut, than this is unacceptable. 
Working with my good friend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, we were successful in including the family violence option amendment to the Senate resolution. This amendment simply recognizes the need to properly clarify the ability of the States to include a family violence option as part of their welfare reform plans without facing any penalty. During Senate debate on welfare reform in the 104th Congress, Senator Wellstone and I included this option as guidance to the States. Unfortunately, there is now some dispute as to congressional intent. The family violence option amendment that Mr. Wellstone and I offered to the budget resolution is intended to address this confusion. The amendment is simple: It allows the States to waive work or training requirements for victims of domestic violence and abuse without being forced to count these individuals as part of the 20 percent hardship exemption. Proper implementation of a family violence option guarantees that women who have been victims of domestic violence or abuse do not become victims of welfare reform. Placing barriers to welfare simply means that these women and their children are trapped in a violent and in some cases, life threatening environment. For many, welfare is the only way to escape the violence. 
While I believe that this agreement is a major step forward, I am deeply concerned that efforts already underway would ignore the agreement. In developing the reconciliation bills, we must adhere to the goals and principles of this agreement. I am hopeful that there will be no effort to ignore the policy assumptions in this agreement. We must also be absolutely sure that any tax cut proposal is fiscally sound and does not explode the deficit. Not only would this be unethical, but it would be economically foolish. 
I want to thank both Chairman Domenici and Senator Lautenberg for their efforts in bringing this conference report together and for working with me to improve the final agreement.

Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Minnesota is correct that during the debate on this bill I have talked consistently about the fact that women do want flexibility in the workplace in order to make sure they can take care of their children when they need to. 
The concerns we have continuously raised about the bill we are debating is who decides when that woman or man, father or mother, gets to take that time--whether the employer decides or they do. 
When it is your child's conference time at school, your employer cannot say, or probably will not say to you, `You can take your conference time next week.' You need to go to them as an employee and say, `My child's conference is next Thursday at 10 o'clock. I need to take an hour to go visit with my child's teacher.' 
Let me ask the Senator from Minnesota, the option that I am offering that allows 24 hours off a year for parents to participate with their child, in your opinion, would that give employees the ability to have some control over their time and their ability to participate with their families?

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun. I want to thank her for her tireless efforts to educate the Senate and the American people about the tremendous problems in our nation's school facilities. 
People talk about the role of the Federal Government in local school policy. By championing this issue, Senator Moseley-Braun has pointed out quite accurately that the Federal Government does have a role in K-12 education in this country. That role is not in passing down curriculum or trying to tell teachers how to teach. The role is guaranteeing certain minimum standards for health, safety, and quality--and that is what this proposal is all about. 
There are schools in our Nation that are rundown, have falling plaster or open holes in floors or ceilings, schools with water leaks or no air-conditioning in hot climates. There are schools, like Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, WA, an 85-year-old urban high school, that are badly in need of improvements. There are school districts in places like the small town of Raymond, WA, which the General Accounting Office has previously identified as needing help with school construction funding--which cannot renovate all their schools due to local economic factors. This amendment could have as much as a $40 million cumulative impact on my State. 
This amendment is absolutely critical to the students, parents, and families in our country who think education is of primary national priority. How can we say that we truly care about public education, when our school rooms smell of mildew, or are far too cold or hot or crowded? How can we say that we care about students learning that all Americans are equal under law, if their track meet across town is at a much nicer school? 
Senator Moseley-Braun showed a cartoon on the Senate floor, in which students were using computers to look at other student's much nicer school buildings. This problem is symbolic. Students in this country deserve decent places to learn. We must make sure that the Moseley-Braun school construction amendment is included in this budget.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a topic which significantly affects every citizen in America. An issue that has consequences for every child and parent, and tremendous bearing on our Nation's economic status and welfare--early childhood development. 
Recent research has proven that an infant's brain initially holds approximately 100 billion neurons. However, without the proper care, nurturing, love, stimulation, and involvement of adults--which most of us were lucky enough to receive--these neurons will not make connections essential for healthy development. The amount of brain development which occurs between the ages of zero and 3 has enormous consequences later in a child's life. Children who are rarely touched develop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age. The 2-year-old girl whose mother is too preoccupied with her job to provide the proper care will not be as likely to develop to her potential. This child might feel deprived and angry. The good news is that if parents are given up-to-date information on how to promote brain development, they will be able to raise healthy children. The result will be more productive young adults. 
Clearly, we must do something as a nation to provide help when help is needed. The most practical, ethical, and cost-effective way to solve such problems as a nation is to increase funding for early childhood development. 
Mr. President, a person's brain develops the most rapidly between the ages of zero and 3, by 350 percent. Ironically, we spend the least amount of Federal money on children during this period, only 20 percent of the public expenditures from which they will benefit prior to adulthood. Between the ages of 3 and 18, however, while the brain develops by another 50 percent, public spending on children increases by 800 percent. We need to change this discrepancy. Parents need more and better information about how to best care for their infants. They need the tools to provide this care most easily. 
With greater attention to early childhood development, we will spend less money on children later in their lives. National studies have found increased violence and crime among youth when they do not receive adequate developmental care as young children. Furthermore, greater attention to early childhood development will help children avoid falling through the cracks. It will help them succeed. They will make important contributions to our country--instead of possibly ending up in jail, institutions, or on welfare. The Early Childhood Development Act makes investments now that will benefit our society later by saving money, keeping us competitive, and preventing needless suffering. 
I personally know that this is a worthwhile investment. As a preschool teacher 15 years ago, I saw children in need of nurturing. For some children, I was their only source of such care. I knew that my assistance was helping these 2- and 3-year-olds to lead productive adult lives. As a parent educator, I had information to give parents the tools they needed to 
provide the best possible environment for their children. All parents have something to gain from learning these skills--we just need to make the tools available to everybody. 
Senator Kerry's early childhood development amendment puts us on the road toward this goal. The amendment gives grants to States to establish State Early Learning Coordinating Boards. These boards give grant funds to community projects for child care improvement, including parent education and involvement in schools. The amendment establishes forgiveable loans for child care workers, who earn a degree in early childhood development and agree to work in early childhood development for 2 years. This will not only increase general awareness for early child care, but it will empower individuals to access quality care. This amendment also expands currently successful programs. The Family and Medical Leave Act is expanded to grant parents time to become involved with school. Early Head Start will also have increased funding, which will improve health and nutrition services for low-income infants and toddlers. In addition, this amendment will fully fund WIC, ensuring that every mother has adequate nutrition--and a healthy baby. This will save taxpayers tremendous amounts of money in health care expenditures avoided. 
A child learns more from its experiences in the first 3 years of life than at any other time, and the dollars we invest in early childhood now save billions later in welfare, emergency room, and court costs. I have seen a tremendous amount of commitment to children, by many caring adults, in my own experiences teaching preschool. But in order to make a real difference, we need a widespread sense of commitment to improve early childhood development services everywhere. We need a national strategy for informing parents, so they can send their children to the right child care providers, and take an active role in their development. 
This amendment is a catalyst for all of these desperately-needed improvements. As policymakers, we must encourage and allow America's children to grow into healthy adults. We need to positively influence the lives of young people right now. Let us change the message we are sending to children, by investing in their futures. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. MURRAY. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Missouri in offering this amendment. I have been extremely concerned about the impact of a $14 billion reduction in the disproportionate share hospital payments. 
The Bond/Murray amendment sends a strong message to the authorizers that the health care needs of low-income pregnant women and children remain a priority in developing any DSH reform legislation. I am not opposed to reforming the program to ensure that payments are being targeted to those most in need, but we cannot allow reform efforts to threaten the delivery of care to our most vulnerable populations. 
Massive changes in DSH implemented in order to be a deficit reduction target could jeopardize the ability of many hospitals, especially children's hospitals to serve low-income children, pregnant women, and the disabled. For many hospitals, DSH payments are the difference between solvency and bankruptcy. 
As we all know, few States would be in a position to off set the loss of Federal DSH payments. Meaning that hospitals would have little choice but to eliminate or reduce services for the most vulnerable in our society. Without the flexibility of DSH, States cannot hope to expand Medicaid coverage for uninsured children or pregnant women. In addition, any efforts to expand Medicaid for HIV positive individuals in order to prevent the onset of full blown AIDS, could be impossible. 
I am hopeful that the authorizers will carefully craft a reform proposal drive by policy, not just numbers. DSH is too important to allow simple numbers to be the guiding influence. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to send an important message that DSH reform should not result in the loss of health care coverage for children, the disabled and low income pregnant women. We need to use extreme caution to prevent any further eroding of health security for these vulnerable populations. 
I thank Senator Bond for his efforts in bringing this amendment to the floor and I look forward to working with the authorizing committee in developing a fair and equitable DSH reform legislation.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I introduce legislation of importance to the economy and quality of life in my home State of Washington. The measure I am introducing will help maintain the competitiveness of an industry that makes vital contributions to our State and this Nation. 
One of my top priorities here in the U.S. Senate is to support policies that promote economic growth for people in Washington State and across the country. To me, this means preserving current jobs and creating new jobs in all sectors of our economy. 
The K2 Corp., located on Vashon Island in Washington State, makes an important contribution toward achieving this goal. As the last remaining major U.S. manufacturer of skis and just one of three major snowboard makers in this country, K2 employs more than 700 people at its Vashon Island facility. The products made by K2 represent a substantial percentage of the American skis and snowboards sold around the world. Maintaining the competitiveness of K2 helps ensure the United States remains a player in the global ski market. 
To the extent possible, K2 purchases materials used in the manufacture of skis and snowboards from companies based in Washington State and other regions of our country. However, K2 is unable to find a domestic source that meets its requirements for two key raw materials--steel edges and polyethylene base material. As a result, K2 must purchase these two commodities abroad and pay customs duties on the imported products. This forces K2 to spend more for these materials, thus diverting resources that could be used to expand business and develop new technologies. 
My legislation seeks to make these resources available to K2 suspending U.S. customs duty on imports of these two raw materials--steel edges and polyethylene base material. It helps ensure K2 and America continue to have a role in the international ski industry. Together, these materials comprise a very small portion of all the materials used to produce skis. However, without the ability to acquire them at a reasonable cost, K2's ability to compete on an international scale would be adversely affected. 
K2 strives to continue as a key player in the increasingly competitive international ski and snowboard market. This duty suspension legislation will help enable K2 to compete and to continue supporting our Nation's economy. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which strengthens the U.S. ski and snowboard industry and supports American jobs.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the pending amendment. I am pleased to join with the Senators from Utah and Massachusetts in supporting this bipartisan effort to launch one of the most important health initiatives since the creation of Medicare in 1965. 
At the start of the 105th Congress both the Democratic and Republican leadership included comprehensive children's health insurance legislation on their agendas for action. I applauded this decision and believe that the amendment before us today moves us closer to enacting universal children's health care legislation. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee I have been actively involved in the negotiations and difficult decision, that resulted in this bipartisan balanced budget agreement which will control spending, encourage economic development and balance the budget in 2002. And I have been an adamant proponent of Medicaid and the need to maintain the health safety net for millions of children, pregnant women, the disabled, and senior citizens. Because of my role in the development of this agreement I recognize the fact that there is little room in the current confines of the budget to significantly expand Medicaid or other health discretionary programs to serve the 10 1/2 million children who today lack any health care coverage. We cannot simply turn our backs on these children and their working parents. If children are truly our priority, we must be more creative in finding appropriate solutions. 
The amendment before us will do just that. It will allow for an increase in the cigarette tax to fund a program that helps working parents purchase health insurance for their children or offset the cost of premiums, copayments or deductible for employer provided health insurance. It does not create a new Federal entitlement program--it relies on the private insurance market as opposed to a Government run plan. In many ways it is very similar to the structure of the Medicare Program which we all know is one of the most successful public/private programs currently administered by the Federal Government. 
This amendment will not hinder the enactment of a balanced budget plan. It does not add one dime to the deficit, as it is entirely funded through the cigarette tax. It is fiscally responsible and does not violate any part of the bipartisan balanced budget agreement. 
Some are arguing that we do not need to enact this act as the agreement will provide an additional coverage for 5 million children. While this is an important first step, who wants to tell those other 5 1/2 million children that they will lose in this agreement? These are real children who are in our classrooms, in our homes, in our streets, and in our communities. 
Today, we have the chance to provide real security for working families and to make a positive step forward for all children in our country. I believe we have a moral obligation as adults to address the growing health care crisis facing these 10 1/2 million children, children who have no direct access to quality comprehensive health care, children whose only exposure to health care is the emergency room. In town hall meetings and community meetings across my State, the people I represent have told me that children and their future must be our priority. 
Mr. President, I think it is important for us to realize that, if enacted, this proposal would actually have a more positive impact on the deficit than will ever be scored by CBO. A sick child cannot succeed in the classroom and becomes an unhealthy adult with few economic opportunities. As we learned a long time ago from the WIC Program, a little prevention goes a long way. Providing affordable comprehensive health insurance coverage for millions of children will pay huge dividends in the future. It does little good to help communities develop the classroom of the 21st century when children are suffering from diseases and illnesses of the 19th century. 
I hope all of my colleagues will support this amendment so that we can move one step closer to ensuring that no child goes without necessary medical treatment and that every parent who works hard can provide health security for their children. 
Today, let us make the same commitment to our children that we have made to senior citizens by protecting the solvency of the Medicare system. I urge adoption of this important amendment.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, my amendment seeks only to clarify the support of this body for the family violence option, adopted during consideration of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. The family violence option allows States to waive victims of domestic violence and abuse from punitive work and education requirements, without being penalized. States would not be required to include these individuals in their 20-percent hardship exemption. 
The family violence option amendment, which I joined with Senator Wellstone in offering to the welfare reform legislation, was intended to give States the flexibility to ensure that victims of domestic violence and abuse do not become victims of welfare reform. The amendment was adopted and accepted as part of the final conference report. 
At the time, it was clear to many of us that there is a direct relationship between domestic violence and poverty. Many women and their children become trapped in violent situations based on their economic dependency. For many women and their children, welfare offers the only way out of a violent and dangerous environment. To create arbitrary obstacles to this assistance simply ensures that women and children will be trapped. This was obvious to many of us, but a recent report from the Taylor Institute made our case more solid. This report reviewed previous studies on domestic violence and abuse and made some startling conclusions regarding the number of women who are receiving welfare and who have been abused by their partner. I can tell my colleagues that this number alone could well exceed the 20-percent hardship exemption. 
Giving States the flexibility that they need to address this crisis is absolutely necessary if the true objective is welfare reform. Any effort to move people from welfare to work must address the obstacles facing those victims of abuse and violence. 
Many States have attempted to include a family violence option in their welfare reform implementation plans. However, because there appears to be a general lack of congressional intent on this option, my amendment is necessary to assist those States who are trying to do the right thing. The States need to know that they will not be penalized for exempting victims of domestic abuse and violence from the mandatory work and training requirements. 
For many victims, simply finding a job can place them and their children in great danger. Giving an employer their home phone number or address exposes them to their abuser. Placing their child in unsecured day care exposes the child to the abuser. Victims of domestic violence and abuse cannot simply utilize most day care options. Once they leave their abuser they subject themselves and their child to the risk of retaliation. How can we say to a victim of domestic violence that they must find a job knowing that we are placing them and their children in harms way? 
Helping and guiding abused women and children off of welfare involves much more than job training. Many of these women are already employed or have been employed in the past; but their abuser is the obstacle that traps them into a life of poverty. States must be able to meet these needs without jeopardizing the overall success of their welfare reform plans. 
I ask my colleagues for not just their support, but their help as well. Please vote yes on this amendment to prevent women and children from being trapped in a violent situation simply because they cannot meet certain requirements that have nothing to do with improving their lives. I know that none of my colleagues would have supported placing obstacles in the way of women trying to leave a violent home.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express deep regret at the passage of H.R. 1122, the so-called partial birth abortion bill. I find it appalling that the U.S. Senate will enact legislation that is not just an attack on choice, but more importantly an assault on a woman's reproductive health. 
I had hoped that the Daschle amendment, which I cosponsored, would address the alleged concerns about unnecessary abortions being performed after viability. This amendment was a reasonable approach and would have met the State objective of preventing late-term abortions on healthy fetuses when there was no serious threat to the life or health of the mother. However, it has become obvious what the real agenda is; to chip away at the guarantees and protections afforded to all women by the Supreme Court. Those on the other side have now solicited the American Medical Association [AMA] in their efforts to undermine Roe versus Wade and to jeopardize the health of women. 
The AMA has simply cut a deal which unfortunately does not include women's reproductive health. They have acted in such a way to protect their interests and not the interest of their patients. Their announcement does not in any way change the intent of this legislation nor does it do anything to address the concerns about women's health. It is simply a political, 
calculated decision. 
During the 104th Congress, there were 53 floor votes attacking reproductive health. Today's vote is simply a continuation of this attack. In the 104th Congress we witnessed attacks on title X, international family planning, and access to save and legal abortion coverage for Federal employees and military personnel. This is not about preventing late-term abortions, this is about preventing a women's and physician's right to determine their own health care needs. They will not stop here. This attack will continue until all abortions, regardless of viability or the life and health of the mother are illegal. Today, we have taken a huge step backward. 
Since joining the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have heard from numerous groups representing physicians and from numerous doctors from Washington State. I have been told repeatedly that Congress must act to prevent the further eroding of the patient-doctor relationship currently taking place in the managed care delivery system. I have heard numerous stories about physicians who are unable to prescribe the appropriate treatment for their patients because insurance companies have determined this treatment too costly or not necessary. I have always agreed that doctors should be making health care decisions, not insurance companies. I now am baffled as to why the AMA would want the U.S. Congress to dictate what treatment options physicians can use to save the life and health of their female patients. Today's action invites the U.S. Congress into the operating room and appears to have the blessing of the AMA. 
I am grateful that there is one last line of defense; the President's veto. I am hopeful that the President will act swiftly to veto this offensive and threatening legislation and that we will do the right thing and sustain this veto.

Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, thank you. 
We are at a historic time in our Nation's history where we 
have before this body a balanced budget agreement that purports to balance this budget by the year 2002. I think many of my colleagues feel, as I do, that we have worked long and hard to reduce the deficit and we are finally getting there and we feel good about it. 
But what we also know is that this economy is doing very well. We know that unemployment is down. We know that those people on Wall Street are doing well. We know that our college graduates are getting jobs that were not available to them 5 or 10 years ago. And there is a lot of hope and opportunity out there. 
Madam President, it seems to me that this is the right time to take a look and say, Who are we missing in this budget? And when we know that one out of four children in this country live in poverty, despite the fact that our economy is doing well and that things are looking really good, we ought to take this opportunity now, as we put this balanced budget agreement together, to make sure that this country focuses its resources on a place where it can really make a difference. 
I come to you today as a mother, as a preschool teacher before I was in the Senate, and as a U.S. Senator to tell you that I can think of no place that we can invest money better than in the young children of this country. 
I want to thank Senator Dodd for his work on this issue over many years and for all the time and energy he has put in to make sure that that group of people who do not have a voice do have a voice on the Senate floor. 
His amendment before us today, that I am delighted to be a cosponsor of, addresses the current needs of today's young children in a way that this budget does not and should. 
I can tell you from personal experience that Head Start makes a difference, and it makes a dramatic difference for those kids who are not in Head Start today. I taught preschool. I know that when you have a child in your classroom and when they are 3, 4 years old and they learn cognitive skills and they learn, in their beginning time, to get along with other children and they learn child development in a healthy way with a good teacher and with good equipment and with good adults around them, they will enter our schools ready to learn. It makes an incredible difference. 
But it makes an incredible difference in those families as well because that mother or father has to bring that child to your classroom every day, and as a result they begin to learn how to deal better with their own young children. The result is a rippling tide. You have the child in your classroom, you have the siblings of that child, and you have the parents of that child really focusing on family. This is about creating good, strong families in this country. There is nothing we can do better than to devote our resources to Head Start for the families across this country and for the children in this country. 
The child care development block grants have been spoken eloquently to. We know, as welfare reform goes into effect, that as women and men on welfare go into the work force, who is going to be left behind at home is their children. If we do not do everything we can to provide child care at those odd hours when a mother is working the night shift at the grocery store, that we are going to have infants and children who are not well cared for. 
The results of that are going to be dramatic on those young children as they are not paid good attention to. But it will have an even more dramatic impact on those welfare moms when they are at work, because I can assure you that just like every other parent today, if I know that my child is being taken care of, whether they are at school or whether they are in child care, I do a better job when I am at work. 
We need to make sure that the child care is available out there so that every working adult can be the best and most competent they can be at work and so that those children grow up feeling secure. I am tired of having young children say to me today that they do not think adults care about them in this country. If we leave them home alone without child care, it sends 
that message strongly. Those children end up on our streets, they end up in gangs, and they end up disillusioned as American citizens. We have to invest time and money and energy into child care through the child care development block grant so that we can raise a healthy generation of adults. 
Finally, on the Healthy Start, we know when we take care of children and their health when they are young, that it will pay dividends in the future. One out of four children live in poverty. One out of four children are not getting the health care they need, not being taken care of. Guess where they will be when they grow up? 
Madam President, it is essential that as adults on the floor of the Senate, we take the time and the energy and the resources to send our country in the right direction when we have the time and energy to do that. And that is now. 
I applaud the Senator from Connecticut and the other cosponsors, and I urge this body to do what needs to be done. Those children were not in on the budget agreement. They were not there. They were not available to be there for the handshakes. We have to be on this floor to speak for them and speak loudly. I urge your support of this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor today to talk about the comptime bill or the so-called Family Friendly Workplace Act. I have listened very carefully to this bill. I serve in the committee that it went through, the Labor Committee, and we went through the amendments. The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has really outlined the true effects of this bill. 
Now, I, like everyone, like the stated purpose of this bill. As a mother with a daughter who is in school, working full time, I know the pressures that every single parent faces in this country in trying to manage their job and making sure that they pay the right attention to their young children as well. All of us are in that time crunch where we are trying to figure out how we can do the best job possible for our employer and we can do the best job possible for our children. 
Unfortunately, the comptime bill that has been presented to us does not offer that flexibility for families. In fact, it will take that flexibility away. Can you imagine a young mother with two young children who has them in preschool or day care, who is told by her employer on Friday that next week you will work 60 hours? Now, how is she going to go to her day care provider and say, excuse me, I need 20 additional hours for my two young children in preschool next week or in day care. Day care facilities are very controlled in the amount of children they can have and the amount of hours they can have. They do not have flextime to allow additional children just whenever an employer says you need to work 60 hours next week. 
It is critical that we look at this bill from the eyes of those who are the receivers, the employees, the people who go to work every day, the people who are really trying to raise their kids and manage their jobs at the same time. This bill does not give them the flexibility. It will, instead, take that away from them and really cause a lot more family stress than is already needed. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote against cloture so we can have the opportunity to offer amendments to this bill to really make it do what the proponents want it to do, and that is to give employees time to participate with their children. I will have an amendment called the `time for schools' amendment that we will offer on this bill if we are allowed, if cloture is defeated, so we can really give that flexibility back to families. 
I have spent a great deal of time going around my State talking to parents who are working. Inevitably they say to me, `You know, I could not get to my child's school conference last week, I could not go participate with my young child. I feel guilty about that. But I went to my employer and I could not take time off.' When you talk to young children today, far too often they say, `My parent does not care about my education. They did not come to my school conference last week. They did not participate with me. They do not care whether or not I get a good education. They are never here.' 
Kids want their parents at school with them for those teacher conferences and those important dates. Mothers and fathers want to be with their kids on those important dates. 
My amendment, if I am allowed to offer it, will give employees 24 hours a year. That is 2 hours a month--simply 2 hours a month--of the current family medical leave time; time off to go back and forth to school conferences; to participate with their child in importance activities. 
What an incredible message that will give to young children across this country--all of us saying to them that we feel it is so important that parents participate with their children that we are willing to give them time off from their jobs to go participate with those kids. 
I want every young person in this country to say, `My parents care about my education. They came with me to school last week for an hour to talk with the teachers.' I want that child to say, `My education is important. I know because my mother was here yesterday. She took off from her job to be here.' 
That is what my amendment does. That is what this bill is all about--giving parents the ability to participate with their young children when it is vitally important. 
Let's do the right thing with this bill. Let's stop cloture today and move on to a mandatory process that really does what all of us want to do--deal with that time that every parent feels today, and let their children know that as adults we will care for them. Let's pass the time for schools amendment. Let's put some flexibility in the bill that really allows employees the ability to care for their families and do their jobs right, and let's do it right. 
So I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture today, and then help us pass amendments that really make this a Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pending Feinstein amendment. This amendment is not a creative or imaginative approach, that has been implied but rather conforms to the law of the land. It is an amendment that simply says that the health and life protections extended to all women in Roe versus Wade will not be infringed upon. It goes to the heart of this debate; will we act today to limit the rights and protections afforded all women by the U.S. Supreme Court or will we reaffirm that the life and health of a woman in this country must remain a priority. 
There seems to be some confusion as to what Roe versus Wade and other courts decisions say and do. When you carefully read the majority opinion issued by the Justices in the Roe versus Wade decision, the limitations are quite clearly spelled out by the Court. The Justices spent a great deal of time and effort making the clear distinction between the rights of the women during the first two trimesters and the rights of the women in the last trimester once the fetus is viable. The courts drew this line and made it clear that the State had an overriding interest in restricting and regulating post viability abortions. As a result, post viability abortions are prohibited, except when necessary to protect the life and health of the mother. The Justices recognized the importance of a woman's health and life and had every confidence that women could make reasonable decisions. I simply do not understand why many of my colleagues refuse to accept the courts decisions and refuse to understand that late term, post viability abortions are only necessary when the life and health of the mother are in serious jeopardy. 
While the language in this amendment simply reiterates what the courts have said and what many States have enacted because 
many on the other side have distorted the facts and have waged a public relations campaign against women and against doctors, I felt it was necessary to work on language that will address some of the allegations that have been made. That is why I have worked with the minority leader on his amendment that limits the scope of the health exemption without jeopardizing the guarantees and protections of women in this country. I would argue that this was not necessary, as I have full faith in women to make the right decision, but because of the allegations and misconceptions that have we have heard and seen, I recognize that it is the reasonable course of action. 
I support the Feinstein amendment as it is consistent with what the States have done and it ensures that women will not be subjected to serious threats to their health and life because some people simply want to turn back the clock. I support this amendment because it goes beyond the pending bill in that it will prohibit all post viability abortions, not just a procedure. As supporters of this amendment, we do not claim to have the medical expertise to pick what procedures physicians are allowed to utilize. Further, we recognize the fact that the U.S. Senate should not be in the room with the physician and his or her patient. 
I will also be a cosponsor of the Daschle language as I believe that a responsible legislator, I must do everything I can to ensure that the legisation we enact is constitutional and protects all citizens. 
The Feinstein amendment does not and will not allow a healthy women to terminate a healthy pregnancy simply because she decides she no longer wants to be a mother. That is illegal and will continue to be illegal for a physician to perform any abortion after viability unless the women's health and life are in serious jeopardy. I ask my colleagues to carefully read the language in this amendment and remember that women and doctors know the definition of serious health consequences and to defeat the underlying legislation. 
I would like to thank the sponsor of the amendment, Senator Feinstein. I know that Senator Feinstein has spent a great deal of time studying this issue and working to ensure that we did not unduly burden physicians and women. 
I support her with this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to defeat the underlying bill that is before us today. 
I yield my time to the Senator from California.

Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Daschle amendment that is before us. I want to take a minute to thank and applaud the Democratic leader for the amount of work that he has put into this very difficult and divisive issue, to try to find common ground that not only Members of the Senate can agree on but people across this country can find common sense in. 
The majority of Americans do support Roe versus Wade and want to protect a woman's right to choose previability. The Daschle amendment does that. The vast majority of Americans want to ensure that if there is a healthy baby in a healthy woman, that that baby is born in this country, 
and the Daschle amendment does that. 
The vast majority of Americans also want to ensure that, if a woman's life is at risk, she is not forced to keep a pregnancy and lose her life herself or have a grievous injury as a result of that. The Daschle bill protects a woman's health. 
I know we have heard a lot of arguments about this. We have listened to this debate all day long. For my colleagues, I want us to remember this is not about choice or termination of unwanted pregnancy. This debate right now is about women's health. 
The Santorum bill that is pending before the Senate today does not and will not end late-term, postviability abortions. As the Democratic leader has pointed out, there are other alternatives out there. What this bill does do is subject women to more dangerous procedures that could render them infertile. What the Santorum bill will do is forever eliminate the ability of a physician to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the health of his or her patient. If the Santorum legislation is enacted over the objections of the President, doctors who try to provide the best care possible for their patients will be arrested. I can tell my colleagues that I have more faith in a physician to make these decisions than I do in the U.S. Senate. 
This debate is about the health of a woman. This is about women across this country and their ability to make sure that their health is protected. That is what the Daschle amendment does. 
I listened to my colleagues time and again on this floor, come to the floor to say they are protecting women's health. We have had many debates about women's health, with many champions of women's health on this floor. I hope those Senators who so quickly rush to this floor to be those champions will be here to vote for the Daschle amendment. 
I ask all of my colleagues to think of your wife or your daughter or your sister. If they are faced with a threatening, serious and grievous illness like cancer, would you not want their doctor to have every option available to save their life? We should remember this is about protecting the women. 
I urge my colleagues to seriously think about the grievous consequences of the decision that this body is making today. I urge them to support the thoughtful, commonsense solution that Senator Daschle and others have put forward and to reject the Santorum bill. 
I thank the Senator from South Dakota and yield my time back to him.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to send a message to parents and educators across this nation. No matter if they are the parents of a disabled child, or the superintendent of a rural or urban school system, each one of them will have something to be pleased about in the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA. As with most legislation, no one is completely happy with every paragraph and clause. And yet, with issues so complex and needs so great, I find it remarkable that we have before us such a potentially successful bill. 
It is testament to the work we have done over the past 2 months that we have brought the discussions over the past 20 years of IDEA to a productive next step. I have always believed that we do our best work when we agree to sit down, put differences aside, and work toward the common good, using common sense. This is exactly what the American public expects us to do. The negotiations over the IDEA bill represent this philosophy and put it into action. 
I want to congratulate Senators Harkin, Kennedy, Lott, Jeffords, and Frist for all the great work they and others have done. I also want to thank the education community for working together through differences, to get to a bill that can pass and will work for students in regular education and special education in schools and communities across the land. 
The Individuals With Disabilities in Education Act is 20 years old this year. It has represented a major change in the way our society views students with disabilities--and has helped us take concrete, measurable steps toward improving the lives and education of all American students. 
In this process this year, it is my view that we have preserved the basic civil rights protections that were part of IDEA when it was passed, and that we have granted important flexibility to local schools and parents to work together in the best interest of children. 
One thing evident from the process of writing this bill--we do a great job here in the Senate in cranking out pieces of legislation, but we must do more to monitor implementation of these laws. Practices in the field of special education have improved dramatically over 20 years; yet our methods of disseminating information--even in the information age--have not kept pace. Much of the disagreement in the classrooms and communities of America between special education folks and regular education folks is because we have let the ball drop on implementation of IDEA. The sad part is that it didn't have to happen--the information was there. 
Information about how much more effective it is to use mediation as an option to legal action. Information about what strategies of communication, teaching, and problem-solving can be used to prevent situations from escalating to the point where they need mediation. In places where people have good 
information, and exercise leadership, you just see fewer problems. 
It has been obvious for some time to educators and parents alike that--as with other Federal laws--there is a wide variety in what special education means from community to community. Some of this variety is as it should be. Decisions about how educational services are delivered are best made with local flexibility. But basic protections afforded by civil rights law, and effective techniques that improve student learning, should not be subject to the whims of geography. 
The IDEA reauthorization legislation recognizes this, and makes several changes that will benefit all students and members of their community. 
First, the new law codifies court decisions, regulations, and other interpretive documents so that the law itself better reflects its current uses. 
Second, the law improves educator training, methods for sharing information, and improves the process for developing and using the individualized education plan--the key to disabled students getting the services and challenges they need. 
Third, practices to achieve safe and well-disciplined schools have been improved or more clearly articulated in the bill--so it will be clear that students whose behavior causes disturbance in the classroom will get help if that behavior is part of their disability, and if the behavior is determined not to be part of their disability, they are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. 
This bill represents improved results for all students in our schools. It ties a student's individualized education plan to the educational goals and assessments for nondisabled students--so we set high expectations and provide clear opportunities for achievement. The bill includes parents in decisions regarding placement, because we recognize that a child's needs are uniquely the concern of her or his parents. 
This bill will serve as a vehicle to increase funding for IDEA, so the Federal Government can meet its obligations to disabled students. The bill holds outside agencies responsible for their share of the health or other costs of serving disabled students, so we can clarify that local schools do not bear all responsibility for these costs. 
People from different perspectives will find things to praise in this bill. Perhaps the best thing is that we will reauthorize IDEA this year, so people can predict what the future will hold, and have access to more and better information. The tension in this country between regular education and special education has boiled for too long. This IDEA reauthorization bill will not pit people against one another; it will bring us together in service to all students.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to a pressing problem for legal immigrants in Washington State, that may also soon affect other States around the Nation. I urge you to support passage of amendment No. 134 to S. 672, the 1997 Supplemental Appropriations Act. 
This amendment simply gives the USDA authority to sell food stamps to States, provided that all Federal costs are fully reimbursed. 
Under last year's welfare law, certain legal immigrants will soon be excluded from eligibility for the Federal Food Stamp Program. However, Congress granted States the flexibility to provide some assistance to legal immigrants with their own State funds. 
At the end of last month, Republicans and Democrats in the Washington State Legislature appropriated $66 million to grant food aid to nearly 40,000 legal immigrants, many of them children, who are not covered by Federal programs. By doing so, they issued a mandate for Gov. Gary Locke's administration to provide food assistance to these immigrants. 
To carry out this mandate, the State wants to purchase food stamps from USDA. The State will pay all costs for administration, printing, shipping, and redeeming of the food stamps. This is State money--they are looking to buy food stamps from the Federal Government, because that program is already in place, and will maximize the use of this State money. 
Since October, Washington State has been trying to make arrangements with USDA to buy food stamps. Officials at USDA have expressed a willingness to cooperate, but believe technical barriers exist. 
USDA is concerned that State payments may end up in the general treasury instead of coming back to the Food Stamp Program. 
USDA is also concerned that it may be violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, at least briefly. This is because USDA would be furnishing food stamps for a non-Federal purpose, although only until the State reimbursement arrives. 
The State of Washington has made various offers to USDA to provide advance payment for the food stamps. To date, however, USDA has not granted a waiver allowing the State of Washington to purchase food stamps. 
Time is running short, since these immigrants lose their Federal benefits at the end of August. 
If USDA does not sell Washington State food stamps, a State scrip program will have to be set up. This will be costly and duplicative. According to estimates by the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services, this would cost a minimum of $1.5 million--due to the costs associated with printing and distributing the scrip. In addition, the State would have to establish new relationships with all food stamp venders in the State. 
This has the potential to create many more problems than are necessary--two separate systems for Washington State customers, confusion for small businesses in border towns in Oregon or Idaho, and the added cost for everyone of learning an entirely new system. 
Of course, this issue is not specific to the Pacific Northwest or to Washington State. Other States may be seeking to buy food stamps in this manner in the future. Massachusetts has already made strides toward this approach, and the California Legislature is looking at similar questions. 
I urge unanimous support for this amendment.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Gregg, Senator Hollings, and Senator Gorton for their assistance and support in addressing this critical program for salmon fishers in the Pacific Northwest. This amendment continues to provide disaster relief for salmon fishers through a salmon fishing permit buy-back program. This buy-back program has proven to be a tremendously effective way to help fishers and fish. 
Over the last few years, the State of Washington has implemented a salmon fishing permit buy-back program to address the substantial reduction in salmon harvest opportunities that have confronted salmon fishers in recent years. In 1994, when stocks crashed as a result of poor ocean conditions and other factors, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in response to the requests of the Governors of Washington, Oregon, and California, declared a fishery resource disaster and provided funding to implement relief programs. Funding for these programs was continued in 1995. 
The three programs implemented were a habitat jobs program, a data collection jobs program, and a salmon fishing permit buy-back program in Washington State. These programs provided desperately needed relief to fishers devastated by the collapse of fishing opportunities. While the jobs programs continue, the buy-back program, after two-rounds of buy-backs, has run out of funding. However, the fishery resource disaster continues. Poor ocean conditions and habitat losses have hammered these salmon stocks. The recent floods in the Pacific Northwest have compounded these problems by washing out natural spawning beds, cutting off pristine stream stretches with landslides, and destroying hatchery brood stocks. 
With the shortest and most severely restricted salmon fishing seasons ever proposed for this summer, this buy-back program is needed more than ever. While the previous buy-backs have only addressed the Columbia River and Coastal Washington fisheries, this program must be expanded to include Puget Sound fisheries as well. Whatcom and Skagit County have declared fishery resource disasters as a result of last year's harvest. The gillnetters, reef netters, and purse seiners of the Sound need relief as well as the gillnetters and trollers on the Columbia and the coast. 
The $7 million for buy-back included in this amendment will provide much needed assistance to the fishing communities of Washington State. The buy-back program will provide financial help to those who chose to be bought out, reduce competition for those who stay in, and help fish by reducing pressure on dwindling fish stocks. I appreciate the support of my colleagues.

Mrs. MURRAY. I want to take this opportunity to thank Chaplain Kell for his inspired prayer. And I also want to thank our Senate Chaplain for working to ensure Chaplain Kell, a resident of our State of Washington, the opportunity to provide spiritual inspiration today to the Senate. 
From the shores of Europe to the community of Arlington, WA, Chaplain Kell's record of service to our Nation is impressive. He served in the U.S. Navy during World War II from June 1943 to November 1946 as a gunner with the armed guard, the unit that protected merchant marine ships from enemy attack. He received many service decorations, including medals for the European African Middle Eastern campaign and the Asiatic Pacific campaign. 
Chaplain Kell was ordained as a minister in 1965 and served as the national chaplain to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States from 1995 to 1996. Born and raised in Skagit Valley, WA, Chaplain Kell is now a resident of Arlington and has been a member of VFW Post 1561 since 1985. Prior to becoming VFW national chaplain, he served as the VFW post, district, department, and western conference chaplain. 
As a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I am proud that Chaplain Kell has been able to continue his dedicated service to our Nation today as the Senate guest Chaplain. I wish to honor Chaplain Kell's wife, Dorothy, and his daughter, Brenda, who have accompanied him here to Washington, DC. And I would also like to extend my most heartfelt good wishes to them and to you, Chaplain Kell, as you celebrate your birthday today. 
Thank you, Lyle Kell, for all of your dedicated service to American veterans and to our Nation. Your work to promote our 
country's freedoms has benefited countless individuals across this Nation and around the world. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue of tremendous importance to Washington State and the Nation. The issue is China and specifically, my trip to both Hong Kong and Beijing over the recent Easter recess. 
My trip to Hong Kong and China was an opportunity for me to discuss candidly the issues to be confronted by the United States Senate; most-favored-nation trade status for China, the World Trade Organization, Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty, the trade imbalance between the United States and China, my personal concerns on human rights, and numerous other issues. 
Additionally, I took this trip intent on raising the profile of Washington State in both Hong Kong and China. In the early 1950's, Senator Warren Magnusson of the State of Washington whose seat I now occupy was the first United States Senator to promote closer ties between the United States and China. 
Since that time, Washington State has led the way in advancing United States-China relations for both the American and Chinese people. No other State in the country is as engaged and involved in China as my State. We have strong trade and cultural ties to China and indeed to all of Asia. 
Washington State's involvement in China is much deeper than trade and economics; educators and students, lawyers and judges, adoptive families, religious organizations, military personnel, and many others in my State have relationships across the Pacific with counterparts in China. 
Several Washington cities including Tacoma, Seattle, Kent, and Spokane all have growing sister city relationships with cities or counties in China. Washingtonians are going to great lengths to foster change in China; participating in local elections, providing resources to counter cultural biases against young girls, and working with the Chinese to create a commercial and a civil legal system for that country. 
A diverse group of Washington State interests traveled with me to China at their own expense. This group included representatives from agriculture, aviation, high technology, retail, financial services, heavy machinery, and ports. 
In Hong Kong, we met with officials from the United States Consulate, the American Chamber of Commerce, the Hong Kong Government and others. On the street and in official meetings, I sought to determine the mood of the people of this British Colony as it speeds toward its new status as a Special Administrative Region of China. 
Certainly there are concerns about the transition; concerns that we require the careful oversight of the United States and others who care about the Hong Kong way of life. I also found much optimism among Hong Kong's people and its leaders; a certain confidence that the people of Hong Kong will take it upon themselves to preserve the prosperous and beautiful enclave that they created from barren rock and the surrounding waters. 
I particularly enjoyed a meeting with Ms. Sophie Leung, an appointed member of the Provisional Legislature that will replace the current Legislative Council following the transition. Though I question China's decision to replace the current democratically elected legislature, I was heartened by Ms. Leung's passion for Hong Kong, her background as a civic activist, and her intention to support and participate in upcoming direct elections. Ms. Leung is also a part-time resident of Washington State. Interestingly, a number of the leaders selected to govern Hong Kong following the transition are actually American citizens. 
Like many in this body, I am following closely the transition and China's handling of the new Special Administrative Region. A heavy handed approach to the transition by the Chinese side will be disastrous for Hong Kong; disastrous for the mainland whose development is largely funded by and through Hong Kong; and disastrous for Pacific oriented States like Washington which utilize Hong Kong as a gateway to China and other parts of Asia. 
Mindful of the threats to Hong Kong, it is important for all who want to influence change in China to recognize that Hong Kong's transition may be our best opportunity to further influence the mainland in such important areas like the rule of law, respect for individual rights, and the many democratic principles that we cherish in the United States. 
As I traveled from Hong Kong to Beijing for additional discussions, I couldn't help but wonder which side would have a greater impact following the transition; 1.2 billion Chinese scattered throughout an area the size of the United States or 6 million Hong Kong capitalists occupying land that is similar in size to the Puget Sound area in Washington State. 
In Beijing, I met with China's Vice Premier, Chinese Trade Ministry officials, and Chinese leaders involved in financial services, transportation, agriculture, electronics, and aviation. 
United States Ambassador Jim Sasser, our former Senate colleague, was particularly gracious and giving of his time and experiences in China to me and the Washington State delegation. Ambassador Sasser hosted a dinner for me and the Washington delegation, and our group was delighted to be joined for the evening by former Speaker Tom Foley. At my suggestion, Ambassador Sasser invited a number of prominent Chinese women known for their advocacy work within China on issues relating to women and children. 
In my meeting with Vice Premier Li Lanqing, I focussed on the trade imbalance between the United States and China, my concerns and those of my constituents on human rights, and the importance of China abiding by its commitments on Hong Kong. 
Washington State exports to China grew by almost 40 percent in 1996 but overall United States exports to China did not grow at a rate comparable to the growth of China's exports to the United States. 
I stressed to the Vice Premier my hope that the Chinese side would soon agree to allow the International Red Cross access to Chinese prisons and reinforced with him that the United States would continue to push for improvements in human rights. A commitment to human rights is part of our moral fabric; and I was encouraged by Vice Premier's acknowledgment of U.S. interest in this issue and of his offer to engage in a dialog on this issue. 
Hong Kong's transition will clearly be the international event of 1997. The Chinese are well aware of this; I reminded the Chinese that the United States is watching closely; Taiwan is watching; indeed all of the world is watching China's handling of the Hong Kong transition. 
In China, I had the opportunity to raise a number of other issues of importance to my State and my constituents. I encouraged the Chinese to increase access to their markets for Washington State goods with particular emphasis on resolving the TCK smut issue which keeps Northwest wheat out of China's marketplace and tariff reductions which would allow our horticultural producers to export significant volumes of apples, cherries, and pears to China. 
The Chinese have made progress in combating piracy of intellectual property rights; I reminded them of ongoing problems and our continued interest in stopping both the production and export of pirated United States technology. 
With the People's Bank of China, we discussed the importance of allowing more United States banks and insurance companies the opportunity to operate in China. This will provide new opportunities for small- and medium-sized firms seeking export to China. 
We also discussed many other important issues including the growth of the Internet in China, the competitive advantages of Washington's ports and transportation infrastructure, the future energy needs of China, food security issues including China's ability to feed its people, problems associated with large, unproductive state-owned enterprises, and growth patterns in coastal and rural parts of China. 
Numerous other high-profile congressional delegations also traveled throughout China and to Hong Kong during the recess. Vice President Gore visited the region with stops in Beijing and Shanghai. Several of my Senate colleagues including Senators Lieberman, Mack, and Jeffords traveled to China during the recess as did Speaker Gingrich and a large number of House Members. United States policy makers are visiting China and Hong Kong in record numbers. Close to 100 Members of Congress have visited China in the last few months. And more will follow as the Hong Kong return to Chinese sovereignty is now less than 100 days away. 
I returned from my first visit to China convinced of the importance of engaging the Chinese, with heightened awareness of the difficult issues in the United States-China relationship, and very encouraged by the congressional interest in Asia and China. And I am certain Washington State will continue to be the bellwether State in gauging both the rewards and the pitfalls of the important United States-China relationship. 
Already there is significant interest in the Nation's Capital in China. It is my hope that this interest will manifest itself in a genuine debate about good U.S. policy rather than good partisan politics. I certainly intend to represent forcefully the interests of my State and our country with a voice for good U.S. policy in the coming months. 
I yield the floor.   
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, I am pleased that the United States Senate has finally turned its attention to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Before this body today sits the work of President Reagan, President Bush and now President Clinton. The CWC will place a global ban on the manufacture, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons by its signatories. Along with protocols for inspections and sanctions against countries that do not abide by the CWC, it contains a specific timetable for the destruction of existing chemical weapons and production facilities. 
The United States provided valuable leadership for many years in the effort to outlaw chemical weapons and their use. Our government was the driving force behind the negotiations that produced the Chemical Weapons Convention. The CWC will go into effect next week with or without U.S. participation. Failure to ratify the CWC would be a monumental error for the United States; a symbolic retreat from our traditional role in the world that will likely impede our efforts to further eliminate and combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
I do strongly support the immediate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. I want to add my personal thanks to my many colleagues who have worked so hard to bring the articles of ratification to the Senate floor. Senator Biden and Senator Lugar have both been champions in this effort. I have great admiration and respect for both of these Senators and I know many thousands of my constituents also appreciate their leadership on the CWC. 
As a Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I have been particularly impressed by the support given to the CWC by numerous veterans service organizations. My own state has more than 700,000 veterans and thousands of additional active duty personnel stationed in every corner of my state. The following veterans organization have all called upon the Senate to ratify the CWC; the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, the American Ex-Prisoners of War and the Jewish War Veterans of the USA. The National Gulf War Resource Center, a coalition of two dozen Gulf War veterans organizations has also publicly endorsed the CWC. 
Such distinguished senior US military commanders as General Norman Schwarzkopf, former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Generals John M. Shalikashvili and Colin Powell, former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, and former National Security Adviser General Brent Scowcroft have all publicly called for the ratification of the CWC. Colin Powell appeared before the Veterans Affairs Committee last week; he gave the committee his unequivocal support for the CWC. General Powell stated that the treaty will lessen the likelihood that U.S. troops will be safer from chemical attack in the future. Given the problems many of our Gulf War veterans are suffering that many attribute to exposure to chemical weapons, I believe the Senate should give General Powell's comments in support of the CWC special consideration. 
Also of great importance to me in considering the merits of the CWC is the strong support of the chemical industry, including both small and large businesses. It is noteworthy that our business community provided advice to the Reagan and Bush administrations on the treaty provisions affecting this industry. 
If the United States does not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention it will not have access to the Treaty's tools to help detect rogue states and terrorists who seek to acquire chemical weapons. The United States will not be allowed to participate in the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the governing body deciding the terms for the implementation of the Treaty. Therefore, Americans will not be able to serve on inspection teams or influence amendments, and Americans now serving as head of administration, head of industrial inspections, and head of security will be replaced by nationals from countries that have ratified the CWC. Chemical proliferation and terrorism are undoubtedly problems the United States can fight more effectively within the framework of global cooperation. 
The Chemical Manufacturing Association has stated that the CWC `does not trump US export control laws.' Instead, the Treaty will expand and improve the effectiveness of non-proliferation by instituting a strong system of multilateral export controls. No information will be disclosed regarding imports, exports or domestic shipments. The CWC will affect approximately 2,000 companies, not 8,000 as the Treaty's opponents hold. About 1,800 of those 2,000 companies will do nothing more than check a box regarding the range of Discrete Organic Chemicals they produce, without specifying the nature of these chemicals. Of the some 140 companies most likely to be subjected to routine inspections, a large proportion are CMA members, who assisted in writing the provisions of the Treaty. Regardless, it is anticipated that any challenge inspections will more than likely involve military, rather than commercial facilities. Thus, we should not concern ourselves with a potential negative impact of the CWC on the industry, because clearly this is not the case. On the contrary, if the US Senate chooses not to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, American chemical companies risk losing as much as $600 million a year in sales and many well-paying jobs when the mandatory trade sanctions against non-parties are enforced. 
Critics insist that the CWC will be ineffective because rogue states suspected of possessing or attempting to acquire chemical weapons, such as Syria, Iraq, North Korea and Libya, have not joined the convention. Accordingly, they argue that the United States should hold up ratification until these states join. The reality is that only about 20 states are believed to have or to be seeking a chemical weapons program, more than two-thirds of which have already signed the CWC. For the past 40 years, the United States has led nonproliferation regimes that have established accepted norms of international behavior. Failing to ratify the convention will not persuade the rogue states to join the CWC. Rather, it will legitimize their action and hurt US credibility in the international community. The Treaty ensures that non-party states are isolated and makes it extremely difficult for them to pursue their nefarious objectives. 
I urge my Senate colleagues to reflect on the measure of American leadership and the indispensability of our nation on nonproliferation issues and to vote for the Chemical Weapons Convention. This Treaty makes sense on political, legal and moral grounds. As officials of both Republican and Democratic administrations assert, the Chemical Weapons Convention will ensure that Americans live in a safer America and a safer world.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, thanks to Take Our Daughters to Work Day, young girls from all over the country will be given the opportunity to accompany adults to the workplace. Today, young girls will be given the opportunity to shadow an adult mentor--and gain experience in a work environment. What better way to enable girls to explore their future and gain exposure to a wide range of career options? 
The focus of this one day event is to bring awareness to the development and education of young girls. Research suggests that young girls often receive less attention in school and suffer from lower expectations than boys. This difference can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence, particularly during the difficult years of adolescence. Lower expectations and self esteem can later prevent them from achieving their maximum potential. This in turn can hinder their own personal and professional development. Therefore, adolescence is a crucial time period for adults to intervene in the lives of young girls. Adults need to take the time to show girls that they can set high goals and pursue their dreams. Today's events will offer inspiration and encouragement to millions of young girls--and show them that adults are committed to helping them--so they can fully expand their horizons and pursue their dreams. 
In 1995, women comprised 46 percent of the paid labor force. The composition of the work force has changed significantly, and opportunities have continued to increase for women. Despite these gains, women's wages, on average, still remain below men's. We cannot accept the gap that still exists between men and women. Even though the gap is narrowing--we must continue to work on this issue. Women still experience barriers to non-traditional career roles. A study by the Glass Ceiling Commission found that women occupy only 5 percent of senior level management of the top Fortune 1000 industrial and 500 service companies. Women only comprise 11 percent of the technical workforce. This needs to change. America's future depends on it. Women need to be encouraged to seize opportunities and explore non-traditional careers. This includes developing skills that will prepare them for high wage jobs and management positions that offer higher salaries in the workforce. 
Women are increasingly becoming responsible for the financial well-being of their families. We need to ensure that young girls are prepared for the workforce--and have the opportunity to live up to their full potential. We can only do this if we have a community effort. Today, more than ever--young girls need role models and mentors--so that they can achieve success.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation to ensure that the Board of Veterans' Appeals errs on behalf of our veterans rather than on the side of the Federal Government. Specifically, my legislation will allow a veteran to correct a rating decision which is a clear and unmistakable error. 
I am pleased to be joining with Congressman Lane Evans in introducing this legislation. Congressman Evans has been a champion in this cause and he has shepherded clear and unmistakable error legislation through the House of Representatives in the last two Congresses. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee will markup this legislation later this week; again, paving the way for House passage of this legislation. This is the first time that Senate legislation has been introduced on clear and unmistakable error. I look forward to working with my colleagues at the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to raise the profile of this issue in the Senate in the coming days. 
Since joining the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in the last Congress, I have made it a priority to work closely with the veterans of my State. This legislative initiative is a direct result of that partnership between my office and the veterans of Washington State. Several veterans service organizations have contacted me in support of this legislation, and I do also know that this issue is a priority for the Disabled American Veterans. 
For the record, I want to detail a vivid example of a clear and unmistakable error. The Department of Veterans Affairs schedule for rating disabilities prescribes a 40-percent disability rating for an amputation of the leg below the knee and a 60-percent disability rating for an amputation of the leg above the knee. In an instance where a veteran had an above the knee amputation but was assigned a 40-percent rating, the rating decision is indisputably wrong--clear and unmistakably wrong. My legislation would ensure that egregious errors like this at any administrative level of adjudication would be subject to review. 
In recent months, I've handled several cases with the Department of Veterans Affairs that directly involved clear and unmistakable error. In one case, a veteran with a serious shoulder injury dating back to the Vietnam war was rated incorrectly for more than 20 years. In another case, a veteran with PTSD also dating to service in Vietnam was misdiagnosed for a lengthy period, affecting his disability rating and benefits and the treatment he received. To the VA's credit, some cases of clear and unmistakable error are reversible but it depends on where the veteran is in the VA process. Some cases of clear and unmistakable error no longer offer recourse to the veteran. My legislation seeks to correct this. I believe that we must make available every opportunity to right a wrong on behalf of a veteran. 
Importantly, this legislation will also allow a veteran who under current law cannot seek to have a clear and unmistakable error claim reviewed the opportunity to request that the Board of Veterans' Appeals review its prior decision. So often we in Congress talk about providing for veterans or about meeting our obligations to veterans. That is what this bill is all about; it gives a veteran the right to request a review rather than subjecting an ailing vet to a sometimes faceless bureaucracy hesitant to correct its mistakes. 
This issue has been cast by some as arcane and complicated. And it is. But let me break it down to its most basic element for the Members of the Senate. Clear and unmistakable errors are errors that have deprived and continue to deprive veterans of benefits for which their entitlement is undeniable. To deny a veteran due to a bureaucratic mistake is beyond comprehension. When I first heard of this problem, I doubted the severity of the problem. But for a small number of veterans, the problem is real, very real, and it is causing hardships for some in meeting the challenges of everyday life. 
The Congressional Budget Office determined a previous version of this legislation to be budget neutral. Stated another way, this legislation would not require additional resources for the VA or take needed resources from other VA programs or benefits. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs does have a number of objections to the legislation. I do look forward to working with Secretary Jesse Brown to address these concerns so that this important veterans legislation can go forward. Secretary Brown is the most passionate advocate for veterans within government service. I have every confidence that he will work with me and other concerned Members to ensure that the VA works for the veteran. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to review this legislation and join me as cosponsors of this important initiative on behalf of veterans.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, in introducing the Victims of Abuse Insurance Protection Act. I believe that every Senator in this Chamber should join in support of this important legislation. 
The Victims of Abuse Insurance Protection Act will prohibit discrimination by insurance companies against victims of domestic violence. This prohibition will apply to all lines of insurance including health, life, and homeowners. 
We are all proud of our efforts to increase our commitment to ending domestic violence. The Federal Government has dramatically increased resources to fighting this devastating public health threat. We have worked to strengthen enforcement of domestic violence laws and ensure that victims have access to the resources and assistance necessary to end the cycle of violence. However, the first step for most victims is reporting the violence and removing themselves from the violent situation. But, if a victim of domestic violence knows that by reporting and seeking help they have now accepted the fact that they will face discriminatory practices in when they try to secure any form of insurance, fewer victims will come forward. This is a chilling consequence that we cannot allow. 
Make no mistake about it, this is a real threat. I have been approached by an insurance agent in Washington State who told me that she cannot sell life insurance to victims of domestic violence. I also know of women who are unable to afford adequate homeowners insurance because of past domestic violence. This is an outrage and runs counter to all that is fair and decent. This is a classic example of blaming the victim. 
As a strong advocate of ending domestic violence, I cannot sit by and watch insurance companies deny victims insurance or impose such drastic cost barriers that few could overcome. I am appalled by this type of discrimination and extremely concerned about the impact it has on our efforts to combat domestic violence.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President I introduce legislation that would protect our Nation's small children as they travel on aircraft. We currently have Federal regulations that require the safety of passengers on commercial flights. However, neither flight attendants nor an infant's parents can protect unrestrained infants in the event of an airline accident or severe turbulence. A child on a parent's lap will likely break free from the adult's arms as a plane takes emergency action or encounters extreme turbulence. 
This child then faces two serious hazards. First, the child may be injured as they strike the aircraft interior. Second, the parents may not be able to find the infant after a crash. The United Sioux City, IA, crash provides one dark example. On impact, no parent was able to hold on to her-his child. One child was killed when he flew from his mother's hold. Another child was rescued from an overhead compartment by a stranger. 
In July 1994, during the fatal crash of a USAir plane in Charlotte, NC, another unrestrained infant was killed when her mother could not hold onto her on impact. The available seat next to the mother survived the crash intact. The National Transportation Safety Board believes that had the baby been secured in the seat, she would have been alive today. In fact, in a FAA study on accident survivability, the agency found that of the last nine infant deaths, five could have survived had they been in child restraint devices. 
Turbulence creates very serious problems for unrestrained infants. In four separate incidences during the month of June, passengers and flight attendants were injured when their flights hit sudden and violent turbulence. In one of these, a flight attendant reported that a baby seated on a passenger's lap went flying through the air during turbulence and was caught by another passenger. This measure is endorsed by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Aviation Consumer Action Project. 
We must protect those unable to protect themselves. Just as we require seatbelts, motorcycle helmets, and car seats, we must mandate restraint devices that protect our youngest citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that ensures our kids remain passengers and not victims.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to the pending constitutional amendment. The authors of the amendment have called it the balanced budget amendment. However, our vote today is not about balancing the budget, but rather about jeopardizing the future economic stability of the United States and eliminating the carefully crafted constitutional balance of powers. The amendment simply requires the President to submit a balanced budget; it does not mandate that Congress enact a balanced budget and it establishes no guidelines on enacting a balanced budget. This is not only the most dangerous budget gimmick put before this body, but it sets a dangerous precedent for addressing important issues facing us today and in the future. 
What the supporters of this amendment fail to point out is that we do not need to amend the U.S. Constitution to balance the budget. The President recently submitted to Congress a budget plan that does balance by the year 2002 and still protects our most vulnerable citizens; children, the disabled, and senior citizens. The President's proposal also continues our investment in education, environmental protection, biomedical research, and criminal justice. Instead of working on this proposal and enacting a budget for fiscal year 1998, we have spent almost a month debating an empty promise. Congress has a statutory requirement to pass a budget resolution by April 15, yet neither body has begun this process. We have spent valuable time debating an amendment that will not get us any closer to a balanced budget. I support a balanced budget; I have supported a balanced budget. What I cannot support is the misuse of the Constitution. The Constitution should only be used to expand rights and protections for citizens excluded from the original document. Our Constitution should not be used to limit the rights of our citizens or the obligations of the Federal Government. 
When I first came to Congress in 1993, the deficit was close to $300 billion. I made a decision to try and secure a position on the Senate Budget Committee because I realized the most important thing I could do for the families in Washington State was to reduce the deficit. I worked with my colleagues in 1993 and passed a successful deficit reduction package. The deficit reduction proposal enacted in 1993, without one Republican vote, has cut the deficit in half. For 4 straight years in a row the deficit has declined. We reversed the trends of the 1980's and restored fiscal restraint to the Federal budget process. Enacting this landmark deficit reduction package, required tough and difficult choices. But, that is why my constituents sent me to the U.S. Senate. I am willing to make those difficult choices as long as they are fair and balanced. A constitutional amendment to balance the budget does not force us to make those tough choices. Keep in mind that this amendment does not go into effect until the States adopt it. The States will have 7 years to ratify. Seven years is a long time when you are trying to balance the budget. I supported a revision to the amendment that would have shortened from 7 to 3 years that time allowed for the States to ratify. Unfortunately, this change was rejected. We should not wait even 3 years; we should start now. 
There is no one in this Chamber who will deny that our Constitution has served us well. It established the longest continuous democratic government in the world. This document and the Bill of Rights are the envy of the world. Within this document our Founding Fathers spelled 
out the role of each branch of government. The responsibilities of the legislative, judicial, and executive branches were all clearly spelled out and a system of checks and balances was added so as to ensure that no one branch unduly influenced the other. One of the most important responsibilities entrusted to the legislative branch was the power to tax and spend. Our Founding Fathers felt very strongly that elected representatives of the people must be responsible for deciding on spending and taxes. As a member of both the Senate Budget Committee and Appropriations Committee, I do not take this responsibility lightly. But, a vote in support of this amendment will forever alter the role of Congress and the courts in deciding on spending priorities for the Federal Government. For the first time in history, the courts could decide how we spend tax dollars and how we raise tax dollars. A group of nine unelected officials could establish budget policy that conflicts with the wishes of the people solely because they believe that receipts will not cover outlays. Every time the Federal Government wishes to spend for Social Security or for a natural disaster, the courts could simply say that this obligation would push spending beyond receipts. 
One need only look at the current difference between the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget. OMB has estimated that the President's budget gets to balance by the year 2002. However, CBO disputes the estimates on revenues and economic growth used by OMB. Who decides? The courts? Who decides what will be cut or what taxes raised to bring the budget into balance if Congress and the White House fail to agree? Judicial oversight of the Federal budget process violates the clear role of Congress and puts greater powers into the hands of unelected, life-time appointed Justices on the Supreme Court. 
In an effort to clarify any questions about the role of the courts, Senator Kennedy offered an amendment that would prohibit judicial control of the budget process. This amendment was defeated and rejected by the supporters of the constitutional amendment who claimed it was not necessary. Yet many legal and constitutional scholars have made it clear that the way the current amendment is written will allow for court challenges to Federal budget policy and decisions. 
In 1983, Congress enacted several measures aimed at protecting the long term financial stability of the Social Security trust fund. The intent of these measures was to build a large surplus and reserve in the trust fund that could be drawn down when the baby boomers started to retire. The 1983 legislation included tax increases, benefit reductions, and other structural reforms, all with the goal of protecting the system. Those who supported the 1983 legislation did so to protect the greater good, namely Social Security benefits for millions of current and future retirees. As a result, it is estimated that Social Security will not need to draw on these reserves until the year 2019. But, at that point, total spending will outpace receipts into the system. Under the current language in the amendment, we could not pay benefits using the surplus that we have intentionally allowed to accumulate. Regardless of any effort to maintain a surplus over the years, benefits would be in jeopardy, unless we raise payroll taxes or drastically cut spending in other areas, like Medicare, Medicaid, or education. 
This is not just my opinion. Recently a report from the nonpartisan American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service determined that we would be prohibited from drawing down the surplus in the trust fund in order to pay benefits unless there was a surplus in the remaining portion of the budget. Maintaining a large enough surplus in the remaining portion of the Federal budget would require significant reductions in many other important programs like Medicare, defense, education, environmental protection, and law enforcement. Passage of this amendment violates the current contract with today's workers that if you pay into the system now, Social Security will be there when you retire. There were several attempts to correct this flaw and exclude Social Security from the balanced budget amendment, but all attempts failed as the supporters of the amendment claimed that we did not need to protect Social Security. 
I have heard that voting for this amendment is the courageous vote. Nothing could be further from the truth. The courageous vote is the vote in support of a plan that actually reduces the deficit and puts us on a real path to balancing the budget by the year 2002. Today's vote is about political rhetoric, not reality. I hope that the political rhetoric is over and that we can begin the real task of balancing the budget.

Mrs. Murray. Mr President, the Senate will soon vote to affirm or reject President Clinton's decision to seek the prompt release of international family planning moneys already appropriated for fiscal year 1997. Let me be crystal clear on this point, the question before the Senate is the release of moneys already agreed to by this body. Virtually every Senator who served in the last Congress has already voted to support international family planning. And it is worth noting that the fiscal year 1997 appropriation for international family planning is significantly reduced from previous years' funding levels; a 35 percent cut from the fiscal year 1996 figure. 
Mr. President, I strongly support and I do urge all of my colleagues to support President Clinton's decision to seek the early release of the $385 million appropriated by the 104th Congress for fiscal year 1997. Traditionally, the Senate in bipartisan fashion has supported the President's position on this issue. And I want to commend the House of Representatives for earlier agreeing to the President's request to release the monies for international family planning. 
The politics of extremism and misinformation have turned this into a much larger vote than it should be. The American people should watch closely the results of the vote on this issue. They will get an early glimpse of whether the popular rhetoric about working together is real or simply a political ploy to mask the politics of division and confrontation that most agree was denounced in last fall's election by the American people. 
Today the world's population has swelled to more than 5 billion people, with nearly 100 million more added each year. Without strong leadership in support of voluntary family planning programs, experts predict that in just over 30 years the world's population is likely to double to more than 10 and possibly as many as 13 billion people. Since the mid-1960's, our country has led the global effort to combat population growth. Currently, the Agency for International Development provides assistance in more than 60 countries through nearly 100 programs. 
Importantly, USAID is prohibited by U.S. law from using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate an individual to seek an abortion. USAID contracts contain legally binding provisions forbidding abortion as family planning and strict procedures including staff monitoring and regular audits are in place to ensure that no U.S. taxpayer moneys go to pay for abortions abroad. Those who argue this issue is about abortion are engaging in a campaign of misinformation and deceit. 
Current U.S. international family planning moneys are actually reducing the frequency of abortions abroad. Thus it makes no sense to me that the opponents of abortion have decided to grade legislators on this vote. Rather, they should be supporting these programs with the same vigor they now display in opposition. Consider the recent program example of Russia. Between 1990 and 1994, the use of contraception increased from 19 percent to 24 percent of the population. As a result, the number of abortions in Russia over that period decreased by 800,000. Russian women used to have, on average, two to three abortions each over a lifetime. Family planning programs are already at work offering alternatives to abortion for women and 
families. All across the former Soviet Union and in countries like Mexico and Columbia, there is a body of evidence that suggests increased contraceptive use actually reduces the number of abortions. If the Senate rejects President Clinton's request to release the 1997 international family planning moneys, the result will be more abortions performed worldwide. 
I want to get away from abortion because that is truly not what today's debate is about. I want to focus for a few minutes on what international family planning moneys do accomplish and the importance of continued U.S. leadership in this area. United States international family planning programs are perhaps the most successful foreign aid programs ever supported by U.S. taxpayers. 
International family planning is about women's health. Death from pregnancy related conditions is the No. 1 cause of death for women in developing countries. According to Amnesty International, almost 600,000 women per year die because of pregnancy related causes. The death of a mother in the developing world is particularly tragic for a family seeking to escape poverty as these women are usually both the principal care givers for children and a wage earner. U.S. foreign assistance moneys have increased the availability of quality reproductive health care, including women-centered, women-managed services. 
International family planning is about child survival. It is estimated that nearly 35,000 children under the age of 5 die every day in the world's developing countries. Allowing families to space the birthing of children will ensure healthier mothers better able to breast feed and care for children. Increased access to family planning, combined with other factors, could reduce child survival in the developing world by 20 percent. Rejecting the President's request for the release of the 1997 moneys will surely set back efforts to reduce the number of children who die each and every day in countries like India, Bangladesh, and Uganda. 
International family planning is about helping young girls worldwide. Cultural preferences for sons in the developing world has dire and sometimes deadly results for young girls. Throughout the developing world girls are fed less; girls do not get adequate health care; and girls do not get the opportunity to attend school. And we all know of the documented cases where infanticide is practiced against young girls because of a preference for sons. It is somewhat ironic that many who rail against this treatment of young girls in China and other countries would now seek to further restrict or end United States international family planning programs that do so much to better the lives of young girls. 
International family planning programs are fundamental to preserving the endangered natural environment of our planet. We all know of the punishing toll that the world's population takes upon the earth: the air we breath; the clean water we require for healthy and sanitary living; and the arable land available to feed the population. More than one-half of the world's developing population is below the age of 25. And the number of women of reproductive age in the developing world will soon total nearly 1 billion. Our population problems and the ramifications for the United States are growing. The U.S. commitment to combat overpopulation of our planet is shrinking. It is a responsibility I believe we must not shirk. 
The Senate has the opportunity to send a message of hope and opportunity to the women of the world today, and particularly those women in the developing world seeking to make a better life for themselves and their families. It is really that simple. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for the resolution to release this crucial funding. 
I yield the floor.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, technology is changing our world. It affects the way we communicate, the way we conduct commerce, and the way our children learn in school. Young people today are in the midst of a technology explosion that has really opened up limitless possibilities in the classroom. In order for our students to tap into this potential and be prepared for the 21st century, they have to learn how to use technology. But all too often today, teachers are expected to incorporate technology into their instruction without being given the training to do so. 
A recent study by the Office of Technology Assessment shows that a majority of teachers feel they need additional training in order to adequately use a personal computer. In fact, school districts across the country spend less than 15 percent of their technology budgets on teacher training. Hardware, software, access to the Internet are only helpful to the educational process if teachers are equipped with the knowledge to use that technology. 
That is why I am introducing today the Teacher Technology Training Act of 1997, which will add technology to the areas of professional development and teacher training on the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act of 1994. My legislation will require States to incorporate technology requirements in teacher training content and performance standards. School districts and local educational agencies that receive Federal funding for professional development have to include technology classes in their programs. In addition, institutions of higher education will be strongly encouraged to include technology in their education programs. 
There are two parts to providing students access to technology: putting computers into the schools, and training teachers in how to use them. Last year, I authored and we passed two amendments that would allow surplus computers from Government agencies to be made available to educational institutions across this country. In addition, Congress provided the E-rate in the telecommunications legislation we passed last year that will provide Internet connections to schools at discounted rates. I also fought for a fivefold increase in appropriations for new technology and classrooms. 
These are steps toward ensuring that all schools have computer technology. Now I want work to make sure that teachers are properly trained to use these computers. 
Recently, the Department of Education reported that only one in five of our Nation's teachers currently use computers in our classrooms--one out of five. Since technology training today focuses primarily on the mechanics of operating equipment, not on integrating technology into the curriculum, this is not surprising. 
Washington State, my home State, has become a State synonymous with Microsoft, Boeing, and thousands of other leading high-technology companies. The Information Technology Association of America reports that these information technology companies are short 190,000 employees today. These are employees dependent upon a technology curriculum and trained teachers in our schools. 
When I toured my State of Washington last week, I was astounded by the advances made within our classrooms. At Seattle's Nathan Hale High School, I saw a science class that utilized computers to track weather patterns and charts the effects on their region. They have created their own web pages and are able to hourly tap into the National Weather Service. Their final grade was then based on their ability to produce an accurate 5-day weather forecast. 
I also saw physically challenged students openly communicate with their teacher through enhanced computer technology. In the city of Bellingham, I spoke with a student-teacher who was concerned that when she and others went out into the field, there would be teachers who did not know how to use the technology. She felt that many of the students are far ahead of the teachers in their ability to use technology. In Grays Harbor County, I toured a facility supported by a public-private partnership. This lifelong learning center takes surplus computers and teaches student how to repair them and maintain their technology. The possibilities for learning are limitless. 
Having technology available for instructors does not directly change teaching or learning. What matters is how successfully teachers can incorporate technology into their classrooms. 
We know that technology is only one tool the teachers need to be effective in their jobs. My bill seeks to promote technology training. I have received support for this legislation from the National Education Association, the Washington Software and Digital Alliance, University Presidents and Deans, Washington School Principals, and many corporate and educational institutions. 
Mr. President, as a former preschool teacher, a parent education instructor, a former school board member, and as a parent, I know the needs of students and teachers have changed dramatically in recent years. My own children have benefit from the use of technology in their classrooms. But a school full of computers is useless if teachers don't have the necessary training to show students how to use them. 
As a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I intend to fight for this legislation in Congress. I urge my colleagues' support for this bill so that we can provide teachers with the tools necessary to teach in today's changing classrooms and tomorrow's work force.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr President, I come to the floor today to introduce a common sense piece of legislation of great importance to the veterans of our country. 
Let me begin by thanking the veterans of my State for bringing this important issue to my attention. I particularly want to thank Mr. Fran Agnes, past national chairman, with the Former Prisoners of War veterans service organization. Fran is a champion for the veterans of my State and he never lets an opportunity pass to share with me the views of Washington State veterans. 
My State is home to nearly 700,000 veterans, and one of the few States with a growing veterans population. Washington State vets are active; virtually every veterans service organization has chapters, posts, and members all across my State. At the State level, Washington veterans are also blessed with a team of dedicated veterans' advocates. For me, this means I have a statewide `unofficial' advisory team to provide me with regular information about the issues of importance to veterans. I hear from Washington vets in the classroom, in the grocery store, at VA facilities, on the street, in my office and through the mail. My service on the Veterans' Affairs Committee is a genuine partnership with the veterans of my State. 
The bill I am introducing today is a direct result of this partnership. Simply stated, my bill proposes to allow the performance of honor guard functions by members of the National Guard at funerals for veterans. 
It may shock my colleagues to know why this legislation is so important. Sadly, decorated U.S. veterans are being laid to rest all across this country without the appropriate military honors. 
For years, military installations trained personnel to provide color guard services at the funerals of veterans. Oftentimes, as many as 10 active duty personnel were made available by local military installations to provide funeral services for a compatriot and his or her grieving family. These services were immensely important to the veterans community. It allowed veterans to see fellow veterans treated with the appropriate respect and admiration they deserved, and to know that they would also be afforded a dignified service. 
As the military has downsized in recent years, many installations are no longer able to provide personnel to perform color guard services and aid the veteran's family. Some installations do provide limited assistance if the deceased served in that branch of the military. In my State, that means very little to the Navy family who loses a loved one near the Air Force or Army installations nearby. And we all know, when a family member passes away there is little time or emotional capacity to plan a funeral. Too often, the result for a veteran is a funeral service without the requested and the deserved military honors. This must change. 
Veterans' service organizations have stepped in and tried to provide the color guard services for fellow deceased veterans. By most accounts, they do a very good job. But VSO's cannot meet the need for color guard services. By their own admission, they often lack the crispness and the precision of trained military personnel. Our veterans population is getting older, and we cannot expect a group of older veterans to provide these services day in and day out for their military peers. We are simply asking too much of a generation that has already given so much. 
My bill is an important first step toward ensuring that every veteran receives a funeral worthy of the valiant service he or she has given to our country. I believe every single Member of Congress believes our veterans deserve to be remembered with the appropriate military honors during a funeral service. By passing my legislation, the Congress can send a message to veterans that their service to us all will never be forgotten. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to pass this legislation at the earliest opportunity. 
Mr. President, I also want to thank Senator and Korean war veteran Ben Nighthorse Campbell for joining me in this effort. Senator Campbell also serves on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and I know personally of his great commitment to the veterans of our country. And I'd also like to thank Congressman Paul Kanjorski, who has previously introduced this legislation on the House side. As I understand it, his constituents in Pennsylvania originally asked him to get involved in this effort. I look forward to working closely with both Senator Campbell and Congressman Kanjorski in support of this legislation.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on January 31 Proctor Jones spent his last day of service in the UU.S. Senate. I join many of my colleagues in thanking him publicly for his work. 
Proctor Jones has been an incredible asset to the Senate and to me. When I became a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development in January, 1992, Proctor became my and my staff's mentor on the workings of this important subcommittee. He led us through the complex and confusing maze of numbers, agencies, and appropriations politics. Proctor was invaluable. 
My State of Washington is a major beneficiary of public investments coordinated under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, such as the Hanford Reservation, the Bonneville Power Administration, and numerous ports and waterways. These entities and projects are sometimes controversial, often complex, and usually expensive. Proctor knew what could be accomplished and what was doomed to failure. He had an answer to every question. 
Of course, that ability to divine the realm of the possible was both a source of joy and frustration. When the answer to a request was `yes,' I knew my request was a done deal and I could count on the funding or report language. When the answer was `no,' convincing Proctor about the error of his views was, shall we say, a daunting task. But he never let me down. If something could not be done the way I had originally envisioned it, he would explain why it would not, and suggest alternative ways to arrive at a similar outcome. 
Mr. President, I wish Proctor the best as he starts a new career as a partner with his former boss and one of the most effective Senators I have had the pleasure to serve with, former Senator J. Bennett Johnston. I will sorely miss Proctor's guidance and expertise, but know he is ready for a change and new challenges. 
Congratulations, Proctor, on your more than three decades of service to the greatest deliberative body on Earth. And thank you for your guidance to first term Senators like me.

Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to pay a special tribute to a young man, a member of my staff, who was taken from us before his time by cancer last week: Pat Ormsby of Spokane, WA. Pat taught me and everyone he touched a most important lesson--how to live life to the fullest with courage, and how to die with dignity. 
Pat came to my office just a few years ago, but he was no stranger to Northwest politics. For 10 years he served on the staff of former Speaker Tom Foley. A schoolteacher, Pat started in Mr. Foley's office as a constituent caseworker and eventually moved to the Nation's Capital to become his adviser for agriculture issues. 
His reputation was one of someone who was hardworking, down to earth, never caught in the insider beltway thinking. He was always remembering to do what was right for the people he knew so well--the people of Spokane and eastern Washington. 
Two years ago, Pat wanted to return home to Washington State to raise his family. As it happened, we crossed paths at an opportune time: he was job-hunting just when I was looking for an eastern Washington director. Pat fit the bill perfectly, and I could not have asked for a better hire. 
For the past 2 years, Pat ran my Spokane office. He worked diligently for the people: he was always there to take cases and advise my D.C. staff on issues like agriculture and business that so intimately affected the lives of the people around him. He was known across the countryside, and everyone to a person, loved him. 
Pat was the guy we counted on. Quiet. Unassuming. But always honest, forthright, and clear. His advice on the farm bill, taxes, even welfare reform was always on target, because Pat always knew we worked for the people--and we were there to serve them first. 
He was rare in political circles. He brought a certain generosity and good humor to the job that is not seen too often in politics any more. He loved it, he worked tirelessly, he loved being in the thick of things, but he never let it go to his head. And though he was a committed Democrat, he took pains to avoid bringing any partisan edge to his work. He never forgot who he was--a dad and husband first, a public servant, and a devoted community member. 
Last spring Pat shared with us that he and his wife Janet were expecting a second child in November, as his first son, Miles, was just turning 3. A happier man, you could not find. 
But July of this year brought tough news. Pat was diagnosed with liver cancer. The news of his illness was tough on all of us who knew him. There was universal disbelief. Everyone I talked to wanted to help, to change the course of his illness, to do something. 
Inevitably, these conversations would bring out a funny story about Pat, about his tireless work on some project like housing, or commodity programs, or taking extra time to help a constituent who was upset and feeling frustrated with a bureaucracy. And the more I heard from people, the more clear it became just how special a person Pat was. 
Despite chemotherapy and exhaustive treatment, Pat determinedly came to the office each day, after taking time to go to church and put his faith in God. He continued to be the one to encourage all of us, and to let us know he was going to be all right no matter what happened. 
Recently it became clear his battle was coming to an end. Pat in his quiet way prepared all of us. He maintained what I can only call a relentless optimism. He reminded us of his deep faith, and said his greatest joy was seeing his new son, Paul, come into the world at the end of September. He even had the audacity to apologize when it became clear he could no longer work, but quickly added that he didn't mind because he never liked the commute. Somehow, amazingly, he always emphasized the positives. 
He took care of his family and prepared for their future. Again, with great humor, he reminded us it was actually a blessing that he had time to do everything necessary to chart a path for them. He took the time to tell each of us who knew him that it was OK, not an end, just a new beginning for him. 
A week and a half ago in Spokane, friends, family, and coworkers gathered together to honor Pat. Mayor Jack Geraghty declared it Pat Ormsby Appreciation Day in Spokane. We gathered with Pat to share feelings and stories about him and his endless contributions. Pat again thanked us all and said his goodbyes. 
Last Thursday, we lost Pat. Our staff came together and shared a quiet moment. It was hard to believe he was gone, and it still is. He had become such an important part of our lives, as an example of a true public servant and family man--who always put others before himself and gave something of his life to so many. 
It is not fair that children so young should be denied their father, or Janet her husband. But the steps he took to prepare near the end, and the way he lived his life, will be there to show how much he loved them. And because of the example he set, those children will carry something of their father with them always. 
We are grateful we knew him, and we are especially grateful to his family for sharing him. We are comforted now only in knowing that a bit of Pat lives on in each of us who knew him: his courage, his common sense, and his pride in community, State, and country. Pat, in his short life, did what each of us should--gave much more than he received. We will miss him.

Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, last night the Senate voted on a resolution proposed by the Presiding Officer, Senator Snowe of Maine, regarding the urgent need for breast cancer research funding. I was unable to be here to cast a vote for that bill because I was at home attending a funeral of my staff member, but I wish the Record to reflect that I would have voted `aye' on the resolution by Senator Snowe.

Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to thank my friends, Senators Snowe and Mikulski, for offering their resolution in support of regular mammograms for women over 40. While I certainly respect the National Cancer Institute and its work, I, too, am very concerned about their recent conclusion that standard mammography guidelines for women ages 40 to 49 are unnecessary. 
At a time when there is still so much we do not know about breast cancer, I believe it is particularly important that we take the best science available and advise women based on its conclusions. More and more, we are learning that preventive care is the best way to catch breast cancer in time to save a woman's life. With that knowledge, we fought hard for Medicare coverage of mammography screening, and now President Clinton is proposing we expand that coverage. 
We all know that mammographies save not only lives, but Federal dollars as well. The cost of annual mammographies is far less than the cost of mastectomies, radiation, or other treatments. M. President, I believe we are headed in the right direction with these policies, and stepping back from encouraging annual check ups is not sending a consistent message to women. Instead, we should be making the same commitment to women between the ages of 40 and 50 as we have to those who are older. Evidence shows that this is the age when the risk of breast cancer increases for many women--and continues to climb in later years. 
According to the American Cancer Society, the incidence of breast cancer in the United States has leveled off in recent years. That is very good news. Even still, in my home State an estimated 3,500 women will learn that they have breast cancer this year. An estimated 850 will die from this disease in the same year. And, breast cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer among women ages 15 to 54. Like many here, I have seen the devastation breast cancer leaves in its path and the children it has left motherless. It is heartbreaking to think that with earlier detection they may not have lost their lives. I think we can all agree that--as with any other cancer--if we believe we can prevent women from suffering from this disease, we must do everything in our power to do so. 
The American Cancer Society also tells us that in the last decade, the average breast lump size--the first indicator of cancer in most cases--has decreased substantially. In 1991, the average size of detected tumors was down to 2.1 centimeters--that is about the size of a nickel. What this tells us is that potentially malignant tumors are being found in earlier and earlier stages of development. Consequently, women have the opportunity to start treatment earlier, and have a higher chance of survival or avoiding drastic options like mastectomies. Mortality rates for Caucasian women have leveled off and even started dropping in recent years. Unfortunately, however, the statistics for women of color are not as good, but at least we know screening helps--now we have to make sure that these women have access to screening. 
I do not believe that anyone in this Chamber would deem regular mammographies for a woman over 40 as frivolous. On the contrary, I believe the Members of this body, including myself, now understand better than ever the importance of regular screening for many forms of cancer. I am not a doctor, nor do I pretend to know more than the participants of the NCI's breast cancer screening consensus panel. However, I do know enough to understand the value of preventive screening for breast cancer. And, I also know that we have been fighting an uphill battle to get women--or men, for that matter--into their doctors' offices to have annual check ups. Therefore, I am very concerned about the consequence of continued confusion over recommendations for how often a woman should have a mammography and mixed signals from leading officials. I look forward to the results of the American Cancer Society's review of the data used by the consensus panel. 
In the meantime, I support Senator Snowe and Mikulski's efforts to send a strong, clear signal to women that until we have conclusive evidence to the contrary, we know there is a benefit to regular screening. Along with my colleagues, I encourage all women over 40 to follow the American Cancer Society's recommendation of mammographies every 1 to 2 years. Again, I thank my friends from Maine and Maryland for their work on this issue and their dedication to women's health. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 4 years ago today, thanks to the hard work of Senator Dodd, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act. It was one of the first things I did as a newly elected Senator. And I am proud of its success. In fact, it is probably the single most effective law passed by Congress this decade. 
Now I want to expand the scope of FMLA to apply to participation in our schools. The Time for Schools Act of 1997 will allow parents 24 hours per year to participate in activities in their child's school. 
As the mother of two children--one a teenager in high school--I know how difficult and how important it is to participate in their education. I have been lucky to have had the opportunity to be involved in their lives. But many parents do not have the time it takes to do those little things that will assure their child's success in school. 
By expanding the uses of one of the most successful laws in years, I want to give parents something they don't have enough of--time. 
When I tour schools in my home State of Washington, I often hear young people say, `Adults don't seem to care about me.' We know that's not true, but we need to show them that adults do care. And one of the best places to start is to reaffirm the importance of their education by taking steps to help their families get more involved in schools. 
These days we have many dual-income families and single parents struggling to work to make ends meet. All of these families know how important it is to be involved in their children's learning. 
However, a recent study, Parents as School Partners research initiative, sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women's Center for the Child, found that a basic lack of time was one of the main barriers to more parental involvement at schools. 
Educational studies have shown that family involvement is more important to student success than family income or education. In fact, things parents control, such as limiting excess television watching and providing a variety of reading materials in the home, account for almost all the differences --nearly 90 percent--in average student achievement across States. 
All sectors of our communities want more time for young people. Students, teachers, parents and businesses feel something must be done to improve family involvement. In fact, 89 percent of company executives identified the biggest obstacle to school reform as the lack of parental involvement. 
And, a 1996 postelection poll commissioned by the national PTA and other organizations found that 86 percent of people favor legislation that would allow workers unpaid leave to attend parent-teacher conferences, or to take other actions to improve learning for their children. 
A commitment to our children is a commitment to the future. I want to make sure all young people receive the attention they need to succeed. 
My legislation will allow parents time to: First, attend a parent/teacher conference; second, interview a new school for their child; and third, participate in family literacy training. 
Just last week, I talked to a woman from Bellevue who has an 11-year-old special needs daughter in school. Both she and her husband work during the day, but he cannot get away for school activities. She told me my legislation would allow her husband to attend school conferences and participate in their child's education for the first time. 
I look at the Family and Medical Leave Act--which has helped one in six American employees take time to deal with serious family health problems, and which 90 percent of businesses had little or no cost implementing--and I see success. People in my State have been able to deal with urgent family needs, without having to give up their jobs. 
My bill expands the uses of Family and Medical Leave to another urgent need families face--the need to help their children learn. 
Now we need to grant employees the same peace of mind about preventing problems in school that can lead to bigger problems for their children later on. The time is right for the Time for Schools Act.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today with great sadness to commemorate the life of an outstanding individual from our State of Washington. Leslianne Shedd, a member of the United States Foreign Service Corps and a 1990 graduate of the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies at the University of Washington, was killed when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed in the Indian Ocean last November. 
A resident of Washington State since the age of two, Leslianne graduated with honor from Puyallup High School in 1986. According to family and friends, Leslianne's lifelong dream was to tour the world. To achieve this goal, she learned four languages, traveled in Europe, Africa, North America, and Thailand, and pursued a career in Foreign Service. 
Leslianne was traveling from her post at the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to Nairobi, Kenya to celebrate Thanksgiving with friends when her plane was hijacked and then crashed. A commercial officer in the foreign service, she provided assistance to American companies doing business in the region. Before working in Ethiopia, she spent 2 years in the Ivory Coast in West Africa as a United States vice consul there. 
It is no surprise that a young woman who touched so many lives around the globe has been described by her junior high English teacher as `a little ray of light.' Her life provides inspiration to all of us by serving as an example of a forward-looking, intellectually curious, and selfless individual. 
My thoughts are with Leslianne's parents Bob and Mickey Shedd, her brother Darin and sister Corinne, her friends, and all those touched by her warmth and kindness. Her work and accomplishments remind us all of the importance of public service, international awareness, and generosity. Our Nation and our world are better places because of her. I am certain Leslianne Shedd's legacy of service will be remembered for years to come.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that, in one act, will do more to protect and restore the threatened salmon runs on the Columbia River than anything else this Government has tried. This bill will designate the last free-flowing stretch of the Columbia River, the Hanford Reach, as a recreational river under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
The bill I introduce today, with Senator Ron Wyden, is identical to S. 1489, my bill from the 104th Congress. That bill was developed with a broad spectrum of local interests who worked for months to create a bill with widespread support. While the 104th Congress did not take action on this bill, I feel confident that my colleagues of the 105th Congress will see the tremendous economic and environmental benefits of designating the reach a wild and scenic river and will help me pass this important legislation. 
Much has happened in the year since I introduced S. 1489. Most important, the scientific community has verified what many locals already knew: The Hanford Reach will make an enormous contribution to salmon recovery on this embattled river. The Independent Scientific Group [ISG], an expert panel of fisheries scientists, reviewed the full range of salmon recovery programs now in place on the Columbia River. The ISG concluded that the Hanford Reach will be critical to our efforts to recover salmon throughout the Columbia Basin. It suggested that chinook salmon from the reach may serve as a core population from which adults could stray to upstream and downstream tributaries and, given good conditions, may reestablish lost or declining runs. 
In this last year, we have fostered a growing consensus that the reach is too precious to risk harming. The Governors of the three States of Washington, Oregon, and Alaska recommended protection for the reach, citing it as critical to maintaining healthy stocks of salmon vital to sustaining the region's fishing economy. The Northwest Power Planning Council has endorsed designation of the reach as a wild and scenic river. Likewise, a number of tribal governments have supported continuing Federal protection of the Reach. Many other wildlife and conservation groups, including Trout Unlimited, the Nature Conservancy, American Rivers, and the Audubon Society have recognized the importance of this stretch of the Columbia and have joined the effort to save it. Finally, newspapers in Seattle, Portland, Yakima, and elsewhere have endorsed wild and scenic designation. 
Let me remind my colleagues of the splendors of this 50-mile section of the river. While most of the Columbia River Basin was being developed for agriculture, hydroelectricity, and other economic activities, the Hanford Reach and other buffer lands within the Hanford Nuclear Reservation were kept pristine. Ironically, it was the veil of secrecy and security surrounding the Manhattan project that simultaneously protected the now scarce shrub-steppe ecosystem and created tremendous nuclear and chemical contamination. Fortunately, the arid land, the river's tremendous volume, and new cleanup and restoration technology has minimized the harm done to this vital river. 
And vital it is. Its free-flowing nature provides superb habitat that produces 80 percent of the Columbia Basin's fall chinook salmon, as well as thriving runs of steelhead trout and sturgeon. It is the only truly healthy segment of the mainstem of the Columbia River. As the Pacific Northwest is struggling to restore declining salmon runs--and spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually to do so--protecting the Hanford Reach is the most cost-effective step we can take since it is already federally owned. 
The reach is also rich in other natural and cultural resources. Bald eagles, wintering and migrating waterfowl, deer, elk, and a diversity of other wildlife depend on the reach. It contains dozens of rare, threatened, and endangered plants and animals. Biologists have identified several new plant species that they believe are unique and found only on lands near the reach. 
This part of the Columbia Basin is also of great importance to native Americans, who have lived along the shores and islands of the reach for millennia. There are over 150 archaeological sites along the Hanford Reach, some dating back more than 10,000 years. The reach's naturally spawning salmon remain a vital part of the modern culture and religion of native Americans in the area. 
Another area of importance within the reach is the White Bluffs. These fragile cliffs offer dramatic scenery, unique habitat, and fascinating geologic history. Unfortunately, a downstream section of the bluffs has been impacted by irrigation water flowing through the unstable Ringold formation sediments causing it to slide into the river, smothering spawning beds, reducing water quality, and deflecting the course of the river. Should these slumps continue or migrate upstream, some scientists fear the river could become contaminated when it is pushed onto the nuclear reactors lining its south shore. Wild and scenic river designation might help prevent such catastrophes. 
The reach also provides an abundance of recreational opportunities. It is very close to the tri-cities of Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, WA, and several hours drive from the major urban centers of Seattle and Portland. It affords residents and visitors opportunities to hunt, boat, fish, hike, kayak, water ski, bird watch, or simply relax and enjoy the solitude. The reach adds tremendously to the quality of life--and economy--of the area. 
It is because of the reach's importance to the local residents and economy that I convened a diverse group of area citizens in 1995 to develop this bill that I reintroduce today. This Hanford Reach Advisory Panel had a wide array of interests and concerns that we addressed in this bill. For example, there was a concern about the potential impact a wild and scenic river designation could have on the traditional uses of the water and nearby lands. So, the panel incorporated specific language to protect current economic activities, such as agriculture, power generation and transmission, and water withdrawals. This bill excludes the 3 percent of private property recommended in the National Park Service's Record of Decision in order to honor the request of those private land owners. The legislation also guarantees that local government and interests have a formal role in the management of the river corridor, which will come under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
In addition, this bill includes the advisory panel's recommendation that the Secretary of the Interior and relevant Federal agencies work with local and State sponsors to develop a program of education and interpretation related to the Hanford Reach. The city of Richland and area tribes, among others, have been working with the Department of Energy on a museum and regional visitor center proposal and are eager to make the natural and human history of the reach part of the project. 
This legislation includes provisions urged by the advisory panel to improve the habitat value, access, and appearance of the Columbia River shoreline in the tri-cities' area. Much of the rivershore is now lined with high, steep levees that were put in place before the network of dams controlled the flow of the river and reduced the need for such flood control structures. This bill directs the Army Corps of Engineers, which built, owns, and maintains the levees, to coordinate with local sponsors on demonstration projects to restore the rivershore. The bill directs the corps to undertake some small levee modification projects in partnership with Kennewick, Pasco, and the Port of Kennewick in the short-term. For the longer term, the corps is directed to undertake a comprehensive study of the levees and determine if rivershore restoration is feasible and should become a Federal priority. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by again thanking my Hanford Reach Advisory Panel and reiterating to my colleagues the importance of protection of the Hanford Reach. The reach is the last free-flowing section of the mighty Columbia and as such produces outstanding salmon habitat, superb recreational opportunities, and vital economic benefits. I urge my colleagues to take speedy action, pass this important bill and permanently protect the Hanford Reach as a wild and scenic river.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I stand today in recognition of an extraordinary, colorful lifetime of service and dedication by one individual who strove to make a difference in his community. Father William M. Mobley was, in many respects, larger than life; he was the type of person who several centuries ago would have typified the Renaissance man. He was a soldier, historian, teacher, playwright, and actor. But, in addition to his high intellect and varied cultural interests, Father Mobley was a man grounded in his Catholic faith and dedicated to the everyday concerns of his parishioners. 
He was known widely as Father Bill in Mukilteo and nearby Everett, cities just north of Seattle in my home State of Washington. It was here that he served St. John's Mission and St. Mary Magdalene Church from 1987 until his death this past Christmas Eve, December 24, 1996. 
Father Mobley came to the priesthood, and his Catholic faith, late in his life. Born on April 3, 1929, he was raised in Southern Baptist roots in Birmingham, AL. He was first introduced to Catholicism while an Air Force soldier during the Korean war, and converted in 1954. In 1956, Father Mobley graduated with honors from Birmingham-Southern College, where he was widely acclaimed for his acting, directing, and writing abilities in the theater. Though he was offered a prestigious scholarship to the Yale Drama School, Father Mobley turned his attention to helping those around him. Influenced by this desire to serve others, Father Mobley joined Dr. Tom Barton, whom he had met while working at a hospital in Pell City, AL, and traveled to Green River, UT. From 1959 to 1970, Father Mobley assisted Dr. Barton in managing a badly needed medical center that serviced residents of Green River and east-central Utah. 
In 1970, at the age of 41, Father Mobley entered the Pope John XXIII National Seminary in Weston, MA. Unfortunately, soon thereafter, Father Mobley suffered a heart attack, the first of three he would have in his lifetime, and had to have open-heart surgery. While this would have been an insurmountable hurdle for a lot of people, Father Mobley rose above his physical pains and persevered to complete his ordination in December 1973. 
He then returned to Utah to serve in the Diocese of Salt Lake City. While there, Father Mobley touched innumerable lives and hearts, participated in charitable work, and ran a retreat house in Logan, UT. But the strains of his physical condition were taking their toll, and finally Father Mobley was forced to move from Salt Lake City, where, due to its high altitude, he was always accompanied by an oxygen mask. Although doctors advised retirement, Father Mobley chose to serve in the Washington Diocese in the Mukilteo and Everett areas, whose residents were fortunate enough to have been touched by this extraordinary person. 
Today, I celebrate Father Mobley as an active, energetic, and generous man. He was generous with his faith sharing, he was generous with his counsel, and he was generous with his enthusiasm and conversation. Father Mobley was a man of incredible passion and compassion. His friends, family, and parishioners will remember him for his soulful sermons and championing of social justice. 
Father Mobley challenged those around him to give and love unconditionally. This is a challenge each and every one of us can take inspiration from. He was truly a man who loved his fellow human beings, and he will be missed by those who had the opportunity to know him.

 Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join over 50 of my colleagues today in cosponsoring legislation to solve an unfortunate tax problem drastically affecting farmers in Washington State and throughout the Nation. This bill will prevent the alternative minimum tax from being applied to deferred payment contracts. 
Farmers routinely use deferred payment contracts to assist their money management and farm operations. Wheat growers, potato growers, and other farmers in Washington State often enter into contracts requiring them to sell and deliver their crops on a specified date for a fixed amount. While these contracts may be entered into one year, the payments to the farmers agreed to in the contract, either in total or in part, often will not be received by the farmer until the following year. The Internal Revenue Service is now saying that farmers must pay taxes in the year of the contract, not the year of payment. I think it is wrong to require farmers to pay taxes on income they have not yet received. I believe most Americans would agree. 
Farmers are not trying to avoid paying taxes. They simply consider it unfair to be burdened with a tax liability prior to receiving payment. I am particularly concerned about the retroactive approach the Internal Revenue Service has taken with regard to this issue. While the 1986 Tax Act omitted the exemption from the AMT for farmers, the IRS failed to impose the alternative minimum tax for 8 years. Now, all of a sudden, the IRS is imposing the AMT. And not only for the current year, but for all years open to audit. This could well cost family farmers tens of thousands of dollars. We cannot afford to impose such an egregious obligation on our family farms. It is not right. This bill will correct the situation. 
This bill will make it clear that the alternative minimum tax shall not be applied to installment sales of farmers. It will insure that farmers pay taxes when they get paid, not before. It is that simple. While fancy terms like alternative minimum tax, deferred payment contracts, and installment sales of inventory property make the issue sound complex, it is really about simple tax fairness--paying taxes on income received, not on income expected. 
The IRS Commissioner has stated that the IRS will not oppose this legislation. In addition, the Department of the Treasury welcomes `the opportunity to work with [Congress] to address this matter through corrective legislation'. With a majority of the Senate cosponsoring this bill, my colleagues from both sides of the aisle and all parts of the country, I look forward to its timely consideration.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am honored today to express my strong support for Madeleine Albright's nomination to be the next U.S. Secretary of State. Long after I leave the United States Senate, I will recall fondly the day I voted to confirm Madeleine Albright as Secretary of State; our 63d and first female Secretary of State. 
Madeleine Albright is a spectacular nominee; I've worked closely with her since I came to the Senate, particularly on the 1995 United Nations Conference on Women. I do speak personally of the great respect she's earned from many on Capitol Hill. And I know that same respect has been earned in Capitals around the globe throughout her distinguished career. There will be no on-the-job training for this public servant. In recent times, no Secretary of State has assumed the post with the breadth of experience and bipartisan support that Madeleine Albright will bring to the State Department. 
Secretary of State is an enormously important job. One of Secretary Warren Christopher's final public statements underscores the importance of the job performed by the Secretary and the American citizens who work at the State Department and in postings around the world. Secretary Christopher, describing his tenure and accomplishments, said, `Russia's democracy was in crisis; its economy was near collapse. The nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union was scattered among four new countries with few safeguards. The war in Bosnia was at the peak of its brutality and threatening to spread. North Korea was developing nuclear weapons. The Middle East peace process was stalemated; negotiations were stymied. Repression in Haiti was pushing refugees to our shores. NAFTA's passage was in serious doubt.' Certainly, Secretary Christopher's tenure was marked by many other difficult issues that met varying degrees of success. My point is to use Secretary Christopher's words to emphasize the enormity and the importance of the task ahead for Madeleine Albright. 
Madeleine Albright will confront a similar list of issues important to our future economic and security interests. China and Asia as a whole have moved to the forefront and many have written that the President will make this important region of the world a `legacy issue' for his second term. I certainly support an activist U.S. role in Asia; from the Russian Far East which is increasingly linked to my State of Washington to South Asia where the threat of nuclear escalation will require careful diplomacy. Hong Kong is on the verge of a return to Chinese sovereignty, and numerous territorial disputes throughout Asia threaten to become military flashpoints. The United States is and must continue to be the stabilizing force in Asia that fosters peace and our economic growth in the region. Numerous regional groupings from APEC to the ASEAN Regional Forum will require U.S. leadership and vigilance. This region, with more than one-half of the world's population, must be a priority of the new Secretary. And I am sure Madeleine Albright will represent the ideals we cherish; the ideals we share with the world through an activist, engaged foreign policy. 
Europe and the former Soviet states must also remain a priority issue. NATO expansion will be difficult. And international trade issues with the European Community will continue to be difficult as we seek to gain greater market access, end subsidized competition in manufacturing and agriculture, and continue to press for protection of U.S. intellectual property rights. Madeleine Albright, an immigrant from Prague, is uniquely qualified to represent U.S. interests in this region of mature and growing political and economic relationships. 
Latin America is finally emerging from the throes of the cold war. El Salvador and Guatemala are continuing on important paths to peace and reconciliation. Virtually every Latin American country is now under some form of democracy; the United States must continue to foster this democratic development and reconciliation. NAFTA expansion to Chile and beyond will require a respected leader to negotiate agreements beneficial to the United States and to educate and understand the concerns of a skeptical public. Again, I believe Madeleine Albright will do a fabulous job for the American people in this region of the world. 
Problems in Africa continue to go largely unnoticed in our country. Children throughout the world continue to suffer the evils of disease and malnutrition. Radical changes may come to Cuba and North Korea in the near future. All of these issues, and many more unforseen events, will require a person like Madeleine Albright. 
Finally, following her confirmation, I want to urge the new Secretary to be a voice for the State Department and its family of employees, many of whom are scattered around the world in service to our country. I find it refreshing that Ambassador Albright during her confirmation hearing freely talked about the difficulties of conducting foreign relations, on the cheap. 
As a member of the Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I look forward to working closely with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Senator Daschle and all of my colleagues for the opportunity to discuss a topic frequently in the thoughts of most Americans, and that is education. There have been other opportunities in the past, and they will come again I know, but on this day, at the beginning of the 105th Congress of the United States, I want the Members of the Senate to recognize that education is one of those topics that is a day-to-day concern of most Americans. 
We spend a lot of our time here talking about many things that are far less important to the American people than education. When Americans vote, education is important to them. When they answer polls, education is always a top concern. When they face obstacles in their lives, they see education as a way around those obstacles. And when they search for ways to make life for their children better than they have had it themselves, education is often the single best answer they will find. 
Before us today a bill was introduced, the Education for the 21st Century Act. For much of my career in education and policymaking, I have seen bills and acts and programs with `21st century' in the title. Well, President Clinton was inaugurated this week, and 4 years from now there will be another inaugural ceremony and a new President will be sworn in, and he or she will become the first President who has a term in the 21st century. I trust that he or she will be gazing into a new millennium of American progress. 
The bill that was introduced today makes several concrete investments in the new American century beginning some 4 years from now. The first investment is in helping people pay for their education, and the bill does it in three ways. The Hope scholarship allows people a $1,500-per-year refundable tax credit for the first 2 years of college, and allows half-time students a $750-per-year tax credit. 
Students can instead choose to take advantage of the tax deduction for school expenses, which allows them to deduct up to $10,000 a year for higher education expenses. No matter which option students choose, they can also take advantage of the restored deduction for interest paid on their student loans. 
These three opportunities aim to help good students of modest means attend that first day of class in their local community college. Based on everything we know about our economy, and with a look at where employment trends are heading, investing and getting people started in school is a prudent move on the part of our Nation. These incentives will help Americans take advantage of the connection between level of education and their employability in the next century. 
The second part of the investment found in this bill is designed to jump-start efforts to repair some of our Nation's worst crumbling schools. For an investment of $5 billion in school construction incentive funds, we expect to drive about $20 billion in renovation and construction across this Nation. 
This is important because of the actual bricks and roofing and wiring that it will provide, but it is also an important symbol. It says to all of us that American children deserve to go to school in buildings that are safe, healthy, well-lighted places where learning happens and community spirit abounds. 
I especially thank Senator Carol Moseley-Braun for her tireless efforts on this issue. People talk all the time about the role of Federal Government in local school policy. By championing this issue, Senator Moseley-Braun has pointed out that the Federal Government does have a role in K-12 education in this country. That role is not passing down curriculum or trying to tell teachers how to teach. The role is guaranteeing certain minimum standards for health and safety and equality, and that is what this proposal is all about. 
I also want to remind all of my colleagues that it is important to retain flexibility in this proposal so it helps both urban and rural schools. There are schools in places like the small town of Raymond, WA, which the General Accounting Office has previously identified as needing help with school construction funding due to local economic factors. We should not rule out rural schools as we fine-tune this proposal. 
The third investment in this bill is the reading ability of young children. America Reads will fund 30,000 reading specialists and volunteer coordinators, with the goal of getting children reading on their own by the third grade. It will establish a parents as first teachers challenge grant fund and will work with existing programs like AmeriCorps to maximize efforts. 
Efforts to build literacy, whether aimed at helping young children read or helping adults read to their children or find a job, acts like yeast in bread dough. They allow people's aspirations to rise, and they will pull this country up to meet the challenges we face. It does not matter what adversity our children face or what they are presented with in life. If they can read, they have a chance to overcome it. The ability to read, write, communicate, and function in the work world--these things are a precious gift all children and all adults should have. 
But literacy problems are complicated, so we must make sure our solutions are designed to reflect the most effective techniques we can find. As we move ahead with America Reads, we must allow local flexibility. We must honor the knowledge of those Americans who have been teaching literacy in our communities--in colleges, in schools, in social agencies and in local community-based organizations. We have to recognize that the best indicator of success in reading for a child is the education level of the child's primary caregiver. We must allow the tutor programs under America Reads to work with families to get the best results for children. 
The act of reading is complicated, and I can tell you that as a former teacher. Reading is a multistep process. A reader has to recognize and decode parts of words, whole words and sentences of words, both through sight and sound, and figure out how the assembled parts relate to meaning. 
Dynamic research is underway right now by Dr. Reid Lyon at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and by other researchers around the country in places like the University of Washington in Seattle. This research is unveiling just how complicated learning disabilities are. It is showing how the brain processes certain kinds of information in the reading process, and it is pointing to effective techniques for mitigating disabilities. 
America Reads has to capitalize on the current research and build as many connections as possible between reading tutors, a student's primary reading teacher and the work of literacy researchers. 
America Reads must also be seen as an unprecedented lens through which we can see literacy and education in general as seamless. Your age, your geographic location, your socio-economic status cannot be barriers to your ability to learn. 
We have to get K-12 education, higher education, community 
education, employment training, local family literacy projects and other organizations all working together. We have to look at education, and at literacy specifically, as the tools Americans need to help themselves and to help this country achieve progress. 
The fourth investment in this bill is technological literacy. This investment is ongoing, and it has already achieved some success. The bill will continue our efforts to improve learning across the country by increasing funds for the technology literacy challenge grants. 
Over the next 5 years, this bill puts $1.8 billion into these grants to our local school districts so that they can help train teachers to integrate technology into their methods and curriculum to create new resources and to work with leaders in their communities to get students access to computers, the Internet and other high technology resources. 
I want to especially thank Senator Bingaman for his vision on education technology and thank all who have supported this important issue. 
One key component of the technology section of this bill picks up on the work that I started last Congress, taking advantage of surplus technology where it is appropriate in schools' technology plans. 
In the last Congress, if you will remember, we passed the Murray amendment to the fiscal year 1997 Treasury Postal appropriations bill, which said that all Government agencies have to inventory their excess computer equipment and peripherals and then make them available to educational institutions through the GSA. 
We also passed the Murray amendment to the fiscal year 1997 legislative branch appropriations bill which set up the same process for the Congress itself. 
I want you to know that progress so far is very good. The letters I sent to heads of Federal agencies have brought in some very good responses, and Government computers are now going to schools. 
The bill before us does, in a systemic fashion, what I have been setting up at the grassroots level in my State--education technology clearinghouses--a place where people can donate equipment and software, a place where schools can get this technology, and a place where a third party can reject technology that does not meet minimum requirements so it does not enter into our schools or libraries. 
Several issues have come up in recent months regarding surplus technology. Many are addressed in this bill. If we are using surplus equipment side by side with new equipment, we have to assure that the surplus equipment meets the needs of the school or library that is receiving it. To send them our castoffs with no value sends the wrong message, and we should not be doing it. 
Schools in my State are using surplus computers as file servers for networks of new computers, and they are using them for word processing and data processing. They have students doing the upgrades in some of our schools, and when the technology is still current generation, these uses are appropriate. When the technology is too old to be useful, we must recycle the components in other ways and not burden our schools and libraries with a gift that is going to cost much more than it is worth. Equity is another concern, and this bill addresses it. It requires clearinghouses to ensure equitable distribution of surplus technology. 
Technology, a concentrated effort to build reading skills, school construction funding, and tuition assistance--our investments are prudent. The goals are very clear. People from both parties will support these kinds of efforts. With this sort of plan in place, Americans can feel proud of their Government's efforts to help them improve education across the Nation. 
Let's look out ahead. In just 4 short years, people will be finishing up in the community college programs that they just picked up a brochure for today. They will be finishing the 4-year degree programs they started this fall. They will be graduating from high schools they are just entering this fall or next, depending on their grade, and they will be third graders in the elementary schools that they started on the first day of kindergarten this September. 
How will their lives be better off thanks to this bill? What will their parents say, hope or dream? What will they think to tell us, if they still remember our names 4 years from now? Will they hail this bill as a success, like the Pell grant or GI bill? Will they thank us for working together across party lines to show support for teaching and learning in this country? We simply have to do the work ahead of us, and we will deserve any praise for our efforts, and we will all be thankful that we took steps today to assure a brighter future for our country.

Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I also would like to address a bill introduced today called the Universal Children's Health Coverage Act, and I commend the Democratic leader for his commitment to this critical issue. I also thank Senators Kennedy, Kerry, and Dodd for their work on behalf of millions of children who lack access to basic health care coverage. 
As one of the newest members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have been proud to work with them on the Children's Health Coverage Act, 
and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican, in the upcoming months on this very important legislation. 
Since first being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992, I have heard time and time again the phrase, `children are our most valuable resource.' Sometimes, however, the actions of this body are not always as loud as the words we hear on the floor. If we all truly believe as strongly as I do that children are our most precious and valuable resource, why have we allowed so many children to go without basic health care coverage and why have we not worked harder to help families provide necessary health coverage for their children? We now have the opportunity to go beyond our rhetoric and work toward solutions. 
The United States has one of the highest rates of uninsured children in the industrial world. Currently, one out of seven children lack health insurance in this country. And if that trend continues, only half of our children will have health insurance by the year 2000. Today, 10 million children lack health insurance coverage, which means that 10 million children have little or no access to affordable quality health care coverage. One child loses private coverage approximately every minute. Children are the fastest-growing segment of society with no health insurance. 
It is easy to look at this problem solely in terms of numbers. But we also have to look at the faces of those children and their parents. We need to think of what it must be like to know that your child is suffering from an ear infection or strep throat and what it is like not to be able to afford to take them to a doctor or pay for the necessary antibiotic to treat the infection. There is no greater fear for a parent than not being able to take care of their sick child. 
These are parents who work 40 or more hours a week, sometimes working two and three jobs to meet the basic needs of their family, like food and shelter and utility costs. They are not asking for a handout. They are asking for relief. They work hard and they pay their taxes, but they simply have little or no discretionary income. 
Many do not have access to employer-sponsored health plans or cannot afford the premium costs for a family, which can be as high as $200 or $300 a month. 
As I travel around my home State of Washington, I have talked to many of these parents who feel vulnerable, and they are deeply concerned about the lack of health insurance for their children. They know that they are only one major illness away from financial disaster. They also know that their child is not receiving the kind of preventive health care so important to their development. 
We can all talk about the cost of the Children's Health Insurance Coverage Act or the financial mechanism, but we have to go beyond the simple calculations and look at the cost of not acting on this issue. Who pays for emergency room visits when a child is brought in with rheumatic fever? What is the cost of treating rheumatic fever as opposed to strep throat? What is the cost to the public health threat posed by a child that has not been vaccinated? What is the impact in the classroom of a child who is severely ill? What impact does this have on my child, the teacher, and the community? What is the cost to society for raising 10 million unhealthy children? 
We all agree that nutritional assistance programs like WIC save $4 for every $1 spent. It is no different when examining health care costs. It is far less expensive to provide a child with a measles vaccine than treat a communitywide outbreak of measles. 
Ten million children without health insurance is a problem that impacts every single one of us, and we can pay for it now or we can pay for it later. It is just that simple. I believe that it is much easier and much more cost-effective to act now. 
According to the General Accounting Office, children without health insurance are less likely to receive timely preventive care and less likely to grow up to be healthy, productive adults. According to the Children's Defense Fund, uninsured children are more likely to need emergency room care at later stages of their illness and are more likely to require hospital admission. It does not take a health care expert to know that emergency room visits are, on average, twice as expensive as a doctor's office visit. 
On average, hospital costs for low-birthweight babies are 10 times the cost of prenatal care. Again, according to the Children's Defense Fund, every $1 invested in basic immunization of preschoolers saves $7.40 in direct medical costs. 
When we created the school lunch program, we recognized the fact that hungry children cannot learn and are disruptive to other children. The same holds true for sick children. A child with a fever of 102 and a sore throat cannot learn. If we hope to improve education in this country and work to ensure that American students can compete in tomorrow's global economy, we must first begin by guaranteeing that these children are healthy. 
The Children's Health Coverage Act represents a major step 
in the right direction. The legislation will provide eligible families a tax credit on a timely basis to cover health insurance premiums. It ensures that the tax credit covers a significant portion of insurance premiums for low-income working families. 
It guarantees them a market for private children's only health insurance by requiring insurers who participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan to offer these policies. It provides direct assistance to uninsured lower income pregnant women so that their child gets a healthy start in life. It ensures a comprehensive benefits package with a focus on preventative services, and provides coverage up to 18 years of age. It utilizes the private health insurance market, and it does not create a new Federal bureaucracy or entitlement, but builds on the success of several current State plans. 
I recognize that this legislation is only one possible solution. Within the next few weeks, I will be joining Senators Kennedy, Kerry, and Dodd in introducing a voucher-based proposal which will meet the same goals and objectives as the bill being introduced today, but it provides for a different approach for assisting families in purchasing coverage. 
The voucher-based legislation mirrors the plans currently utilized by 14 States in their efforts to help uninsured children. One of these States is my home State of Washington, which has implemented a plan to help uninsured children receive vital health care services. Because of this commitment in the State of Washington, the number of uninsured children has declined. But the States cannot do it alone. And the Federal Government must ensure that every family, regardless of where they live, have access to affordable health insurance and that the benefits are comprehensive and include an aggressive preventative strategy. 
In the last Congress, we made a commitment to working Americans that they would not lose their health insurance coverage if they changed jobs or had a preexisting condition. The Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation will help hundreds of working families. Now we have the opportunity to build on this bipartisan legislation and work to help working families purchase health insurance coverage for their children. 
I know that my Republican colleagues recognize the urgent need to give our children a healthy start. And I ask that we use the bipartisan approach utilized in passing the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill to help all of our children. Both the Democratic and Republican leadership are pledged to improving the quality of life for families and putting families first. I can think of no better and important issue for American families than the health security of all of our children. 
In 1965, Congress made a commitment to our Nation's senior citizens that they would not have to go without health coverage. In 1965, we gave senior citizens access to affordable health insurance coverage to protect them from financial ruin and ensure a longer, healthy life. Let 1997 be the year that we make the same commitment to our children. 
Again, I want to thank the Democratic leader for his efforts. And I am anxious to begin work on this important initiative and many others that are before us. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator Frist, the Senate stand in recess under the previous order.
