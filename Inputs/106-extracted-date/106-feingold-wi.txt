    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to CHUCK ROBB, a friend and colleague whom I deeply admire. Throughout our service together in the U.S. Senate, I have observed Senator ROBB's unfailing commitment to principle. CHUCK ROBB served his country courageously in Vietnam, and he served the Commonwealth of Virginia just as courageously in the U.S. Senate. Time and again, he voted his conscience, despite pressures to the contrary. Senator ROBB let principle, not politics, be his guide during his service in the body. His conduct should give every American faith that legislators can conduct themselves in a way that does honor to our democracy. 
   Senator ROBB opposed the flag desecration constitutional amendment, opposed the Defense of Marriage Act, and supported spending cuts while opposing the politically popular tax cuts. He did what he thought was in the best interest of Virginians and the nation, and I thank him for that. The Senate is a better place for Senator ROBB's service, and I join my colleagues in wishing him and his family all the best as he moves on to new endeavors.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of my colleague from Colorado, Mr. CAMPBELL, and of my colleague from Hawaii, Mr. INOUYE on H.R. 5528, the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act. I am pleased that this measure includes several provisions that will benefit Wisconsin tribes. 
   However, I have concerns regarding title XV of this measure, which reinstates applications for particular parcels of land that are now part of the Chugach National Forest to be conveyed to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, CAC, the Alaska Native Corporation for the Chugach Region. The provisions included in title XV of H.R. 5528 differ from those included in title II of H.R. 2547 and its companion bill in this body S. 1686. These bills are in the jurisdiction of the Senate Energy Committee. Would the Senator be willing to allow me to engage in discussion with the Senator from Alaska, Mr. MURKOWSKI to clarify a few important points about this legislation?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. As I understand the legislation, it directs the Secretary of the Interior to reinstate applications for the conveyance of seven parcels of land, now in federal ownership as part of the Chugach National Forest, for a determination of eligibility for conveyance to the CAC as historical places or cemetery sites under section 14(h) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANCSA. Is that correct?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. As the Senator knows, 43 C.F.R. &#167;2653.5 requires that regional corporations that are conveyed cemetery sites or historical places pursuant to section 14(h) of ANCSA agree to accept a covenant in the conveyance that these cemetery sites or historical places will be maintained and preserved solely as cemetery sites or historical places by the regional corporation, in accordance with the provisions for conveyance reservations in 43 C.F.R. &#167;2653.11. Is it the case that, if the Secretary of the Interior chooses to act favorably on these conveyance applications, nothing in this act is intended to prevent the Secretary from complying with the covenant requirements of these regulations in conveying these seven parcels of land to the CAC?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. As my colleague further knows, the conveyance reservations contained in 43 C.F.R. &#167;2653.11 prohibit the grantee from authorizing any mining or mineral activity of any type, or ``any use which is incompatible with or is in derogation of the values of the area as a cemetery or historic place'' as defined further by 36 C.F.R. &#167;800.9. Is it the case that nothing in this act is intended to prevent the United States from seeking enforcement of such prohibitions, as authorized under C.F.R. 2653.11?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise with regret to mark another milestone in the history of our system of justice. This morning's papers report that yesterday the state of Texas carried out its 39th execution, the most of any state since 1862, when the military hanged 39 Native Americans in one day in Minnesota. This evening, Texas is scheduled to surpass that record with its 40th execution. This is a regrettable record. 
   This year, as of yesterday, states in America have executed 82 people. We have reached a sad state of affairs when this Country executes nearly 100 people every year. In 1998, only China and the Congo executed more people a year than did the United States. 
   And we have reached an inequitable state of affairs when nearly half of the executions this year--39 out of the 82 to date--were carried out in just one state. The state with the next most executions this year, Oklahoma, has had 11 executions. Southern states have carried out nearly 9 out of 10 executions that have taken place this year. 
   Across the street, the building that holds the Supreme Court of the United States has emblazoned across its pediment the words ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' In a Nation that prides itself in that equal justice, how can we abide a system where nearly half of the executions are carried out in just one state? 
   Finally, I rise to mark another milestone. On Tuesday of next week, the Federal Government is scheduled to reenter the grim business of execution. For nearly 40 years, no one has been executed in the name of the people of the United States. That is set to change next Tuesday. 
   In light of the demonstrated evidence of regional and racial disparity in the application of this most final punishment, I call on the President to stay that execution. I call on the President to impose a moratorium on Federal executions and establish a blue ribbon commission to examine the fairness of the system of capital punishment in America. 
   In September, the Department of Justice released a report on the federal death penalty system. That report found that whether the federal system sends people to death row appears to be related to the federal district in which they are prosecuted or the color of their skin. 
   After the Justice Department released the report, White House spokesman Jake Siewert confirmed the President's view that ``these numbers are troubling'' and that more information must be gathered to determine ``more about how the system works and what's behind those numbers,'' including ``why minorities in some geographic districts are disproportionately represented.'' 
   We do not yet know why our federal system produces racially and geographically lopsided results. We need a systematic review. 
   Many are joining in asking the President for a moratorium on executions. Their ranks include, among so many others, Lloyd Cutler, the esteemed former adviser to Presidents Carter and Clinton; Julian Bond, Chairman of the NAACP; and the Reverend Joseph Lowrey, chair of the Black Leadership Forum and President emeritus of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
   Yes, justice demands that crimes be punished. But if we demand justice, we must administer justice fairly. 
   Before we reach the milestone of reinstituting Federal executions, let us pause to evaluate the fairness of our Nation's machinery of death. 
   Mr. President, let this be a milestone that we choose not to reach, next week. God willing, let this be a milestone that we choose not to reach, if ever, for some time to come.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like the opportunity to address the bankruptcy issue, and I am here to say that I am very disappointed that the majority leader chose to bring this bankruptcy bill back to the floor. 
   Let me remind my colleagues that the House passed this conference report on October 12, and the majority leader first moved to proceed to the conference report on October 19--well before the election. He could have sought and invoked cloture on the bill and had this final debate any time in the month before the election. Instead, he waited until right before the election, and then was unable to get cloture because many Senators, of course, were back home in their States campaigning. 
   In this lame duck session when we ought to be doing only the business that is essential to keep the Government running and leave substantive legislation to the representatives of the people who were duly elected on November 7, only now has cloture been invoked and we are headed for a vote on final passage. 
   We are here in a lame-duck session, taking final action on an extraordinarily important and controversial and far-reaching substantive legislation. 
   The American people didn't vote for this Senate on November 7. With all due respect, they voted for a new Senate, with a decidedly different makeup. Why did the majority leader bring up this bill again? Why is he trying to put this bill through in this lame-duck session? The Senate is going to have a very different makeup in a month, and this legislation might turn out very differently in the next Congress. I suppose because we are all eager to finally bring this Congress to a close he thought there would be pressure on those Members who oppose the bill to relinquish the debate time the Senate rules provide for and let the bill go to final passage without a fight. 
   The supporters of this bill want to get this over with, pass the bill, and send it to the President where it will certainly meet a veto pen or perhaps a veto pocket, depending on when the other business of the Senate is completed. 
   Before we recessed for the election, I spoke at some length about the very regrettable procedure that was used to bring this bankruptcy bill back to the floor. I continue to believe that allowing four Senators meeting in secret in a conference committee to write the final version of the bill that we are now considering is a terrible affront to the tradition of reasoned deliberation in this body. As I said before, this procedure diminishes the Senate floor in favor of the backroom conference committee chosen to address these issues by none but themselves, accountable to none but themselves and open to observations by none but themselves. This procedure sets a terrible precedent for our work, and I sincerely hope it will never be used again. 
   I would be remiss in my responsibilities as a Senator if I did not also speak about the terrible damage that this bill will do to the bankruptcy system in our country and, even more importantly, to so many hard-working American families who will bear the brunt of the unfair so-called reforms that are included in this bill. It is a good thing that this bill will not become law. 
   The President's veto, whether by pocket or by pen, will protect our country's most vulnerable citizens from a harsh and unfair measure pushed through this Congress by the most powerful and wealthy lobbying forces in this country. President Clinton will do a service to those citizens by standing up to powerful special interests and vetoing this bill in the waning days of his administration. 
   First, let me talk about what is not in this bill, which is directly related to the fact that powerful special interests have had the chance to shape it. As I have discussed on this floor before a number of times, this bill is not a balanced piece of legislation. The interests that are the strongest supporters of this bill--the credit card companies  and the big banks--succeeded in limiting the provisions that will have any effect on the way they do business. These interests gave us and our political parties millions of dollars of campaign contributions and they like the results they achieved in this bill. 
   Billions of credit card solicitations go out each year to consumers--not millions but billions. Most experts agree that part of the rise in bankruptcy filings over the past decade, although the number is actually now on the way down, is due to 
   credit card companies and the banks irresponsibly extending credit to people who have already shown they cannot handle additional debt. 
   I have next to me a pile of credit card solicitations. This pile of solicitations was collected by just one of my staff members over the past year and a half since this bill was marked up in the Senate Judiciary Committee. These were sent to his home. This pile of solicitations, 85 in all, came in the mail to one person--one person--in the last 19 months. I am sure that the member of my staff is a very creditworthy individual, but 85 offers for a new credit card--and these direct mail offers don't include the constant invitations for credit cards that people see every day on the Internet and on the TV. 
   This industry's sales techniques are out of control. The credit card companies are making bad decisions every day, and now they are here before this Congress asking for our help. Boy, did we give it to them. This bill is a bailout for the credit card industry. It is going to make it easier for credit card companies to collect more on the bad decisions they have made, the credit they have extended to people who already have maxed out on 2, 5, even 10 credit cards. Make no mistake, giving the credit card companies more power will work to the detriment of women and children trying to collect alimony and child support. 
   If we are going to pass a credit card industry bailout bill, the least we should do is help save the industry from itself by taking some steps to make sure consumers are made more aware of the consequences of taking on ever-increasing amounts of debt. We had the chance in this bill to require credit card companies to be more open with consumers about the consequences of running a balance on a card, but we didn't do it. We need more prevalent and more detailed disclosures on credit card statements and solicitations. There are limited disclosure requirements in the bill, but they don't go far enough, in my opinion. I think it is clear that the main reason they don't is the power of the credit card companies.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will quote from the editorial:  
   When the credit card industry came to Congress to ask for help in collecting debts from deadbeats, Congress should have said: It's not government's job to bail you out. Why don't you tighten up your own lending practices? Instead, Congress let the industry turn a bankruptcy reform bill into a debt collection assistance plan.  
   The editorial continues:  
   The House and Senate had before them 172 recommendations from the National Bankruptcy Reform Commission, which was led by Madison attorney Brady Williamson. The commission had stressed that bankruptcy law must remain balanced: It must work for creditors and debtors. 
   But the Congressmen also had before them lobbyists for the credit card industry and similar lenders. Quickly, bankruptcy reform legislation became a campaign fund-raising bonanza for the politicians, with the lending industry ``investing'' $20 million in contributions. Just as quickly, bankruptcy reform turned into the credit card industry's bill.  
   My colleagues are well aware of my concern about the influence of money on politics and policy. As I have said a number of times on this floor over this past year, this bankruptcy bill is really a poster child for the need for campaign finance reform. You only have to look at what the credit card industries get in this bill and, just as importantly, the disclosure that consumers don't get to understand that. 
   There is another thing missing in this bill. Remember, this bill is supposedly designed to end the abuses of the bankruptcy system by people who really can't afford to pay off more of their debts. But the biggest abuses, and all the experts agree on this, come when wealthy people in certain States file for bankruptcy by taking advantage of very large or unlimited homestead exemptions that are available in their States. Some people with large debts even move to a State such as Florida or Texas where there is an unlimited homestead exemption specifically for the purpose of filing for bankruptcy. 
   The National Bankruptcy Review Commission and virtually all leading academics believe that homestead exemptions are being abused and that a national standard is, indeed, needed. And, by a vote of 76-22, the Senate adopted a very good amendment from my colleague, the senior Senator from Wisconsin, which would have closed the loophole. That amendment would have put a $100,000 cap on the amount of money that a debtor shield from creditors through the homestead exemption. 
   But almost unbelievably, after that overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Senate, that amendment was stripped out of the bill by a group of Senators--again working in secret--and it was replaced by a weak substitute. The bill  that has been stuffed into this conference report limits the homestead exemption to $100,000 but only for property purchased within 2 years of filing for bankruptcy. That means that wealthy debtors can plan for bankruptcy by moving to an unlimited homestead exemption State, buying a palatial estate and putting off their creditors for 2 years before filing bankruptcy. If they do that, they can continue to shield millions of dollars in assets and throw off their debts with the bankruptcy discharge. 
   The bill will have no effect on this abuse of the bankruptcy system. This bill will not close the homestead exemption loophole of people like Burt Reynolds and Bowie Kuhn have used in the past. Supporters of this bill have chosen to ignore reforms that would give this bill real balance. Somehow the interests of wealthy debtors who use the homestead exemption to abuse the bankruptcy system are more important than the interests of hard-working Americans who, through no fault of their own, whether from a medical catastrophe or the loss of a job or a divorce, are forced to seek the financial fresh start that bankruptcy has made possible since the beginning of our Republic. 
   It is interesting, and very revealing, to contrast the treatment by this bill of wealthy homeowners who abuse the bankruptcy system with how it treats poor tenants who need the protection of the bankruptcy system to keep from being thrown out on the street while they try to get their affairs in order. As I mentioned, the provision dealing with the homestead exemption is virtually meaningless. At the same time, the bill includes a draconian provision that denies the bankruptcy stay to tenants trying to hold off eviction proceedings, even if they are able to pay their rent while the bankruptcy is pending. I think this provision--I hesitate to use this language--has become something that is purely punitive. It will have no impact at all on getting debtors to pay past due rent. It will result in people being evicted who are not abusing the bankruptcy system, but who are trying to use it for exactly the purpose for which it was intended--to get a fresh start and become once again productive members of our society. 
   When the bankruptcy bill was before the Senate at the beginning of this year, I tried very hard to pass an amendment that would have made the bill less harsh on tenants while at the same time denying the protection of the automatic stay to repeat filers who are abusing the system, and who, as I understand it, were the whole reason why they want to change the provision. I listened to the arguments of the Senator from Alabama who had concerns about my original amendment. What I did then was to modify the amendment to take account of some reasonable hypothetical situations that the Senator from Alabama came up with in our debates in committee and then here on the floor. But the realtors strongly opposed my amendment and the Senate rejected it by a nearly party line vote. That was unfortunate. It confirmed my view that this bill is not balanced. It is not rational. It is about punishing people, not just stopping the abuses that we all agree should be stopped. 
   Shortly before the election, the Senator from Alabama was on the floor once again arguing that this bill is necessary to crack down on tenants abusing the bankruptcy system to live rent free. My amendment would have cracked down on those abusers too, but without harming good faith debtors who need the automatic stay of an eviction to avoid homelessness and be able to pay some of their debts. The failure of the majority to recognize the harshness of the bill on this point and accept a reasonable amendment that deals with the abuse just as effectively was a great disappointment to me. It reinforced by judgment that this bill is not balanced, it is not fair. 
   Let me turn to what proponents view as the central feature of this bill, the means test. After much work, I believe this feature of the bill is still flawed and unfair. The means test is the mechanism that the bill's proponents believe will force people who can really some portion of their debts into Chapter 13 repayment plans instead of Chapter 7 discharges. The means test requires every debtor to file detailed information on their expenses and income which is then analyzed according to a formula. Those who pass the means test can file a Chapter 7 case; those who fail would have to file under Chapter 13. 
   The bill that is now before us includes an important ``safe harbor'' for debtors who are below the median income. The means test does not apply to them. That is a good thing, since studies show that only 2 or 3 percent of debtors would be required to move from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 under the means test. But even with that ``safe harbor,'' the bill has significant problems. First, the bill specifies that for purposes of determining the safe harbor, the median income for each individual state should be used, rather than the higher of the state or national median income. This will unfairly disadvantage people who live in high cost areas of low median income states. In the Senate bill, we included a safe harbor from creditor motions that applied to people with income less than either the national or the median income. The people who drafted this final bill ignored that standard. I doubt they really believe it will mean that more abusers of the system will be caught by the means test. But they did it anyway, giving further evidence of the arbitrary nature of this bill. 
   In addition, the means test still employs standards of reasonable living expenses developed by the Internal Revenue code for a wholly different purposes. These standards are too inflexible to be fair in determining what families can live on as they go through a bankruptcy. They are arbitrary. And they are 
   also ambiguous with respect to things like car payments because they were not designed to be used in this context. We have pointed this out repeatedly over the past few years, but the sponsors of the legislation have insisted on using these inflexible IRS standards. 
   The safe harbor from the means test also inexplicably counts a separated spouse's income as income available to a mother with children who has filed for bankruptcy, even if the spouse is not paying any child support. This can't be fair. Let me repeat that. Mothers filing for bankruptcy because their spouses have left them are treated for purposes of the safe harbor as if the spouse's income is still available to them. That is what the bill we are about to vote on does. It makes no sense. It is arbitrary and punitive. 
   But perhaps the thing that is most curious about the means test is that while we now have a safe harbor for lower income people, they still have to fill out all the same paperwork, doing all of means test calculations using the IRS expense standards. Why is that? If the intent is to exempt lower income debtors from the means test, why have them go through the means test anyway? The burden of the means test for these people is not the result--a tiny percentage would ever be sent to Chapter 13 because of it. No, it is the burdensome paperwork that is the problem. This bill makes it more difficult to file for bankruptcy. By leaving the paperwork requirements in place, the means test remains a barrier for low income debtors, even with the safe harbor. 
   Let me give you one example. This bill would deny the protection of bankruptcy to a single mother with income well below the State median income if she does not present copies of income tax returns for the last 3 years, even if those returns are in the possession of her ex-husband. I can see no justification for this result whatsoever. 
   So for those supporters of the bill who trumpet the safe harbor, I ask you: Why doesn't the bill apply the same safe harbor to creditor motions as the Senate bill did, and why doesn't it exempt people who fall within the safe harbor from the paperwork requirements? I have yet to hear reasonable answers to those questions, which leads me to believe that there are no reasonable answers. This bill is arbitrary, and it is punitive. 
   This bill also includes a number of ``presumptions of nondischargeability'' provisions, which basically say, ``these debts can't be discharged in bankruptcy because we think they look like people are running up bills in contemplation of bankruptcy.'' In other words, they are abusing the system. They are accumulating debt with no intention of paying it off. 
   The problem is that these presumptions are unfair. So instead of being a  deterrent to abuse of the system, they are simply a gift to the credit industry, and a harsh punishment to hard working people trying to do the best they can to meet their obligations to their families. One such provision creates a presumption of nondischargeability if a debtor takes $750 of cash advances within 70 days of bankruptcy. Seven hundred fifty dollars in a little more than two months. That is not much. I think all of us can imagine a single mother with children who loses her job or has unexpected medical bills for her kids and has to use cash advances to buy food and for her family or pay her rent. But if that woman files for bankruptcy, the debt to the credit card company is presumed to be fraudulent. That means that the debt from those cash advances will not be discharged by bankruptcy. It will still hang over her head as she tries to get back on her feet and support her family after the bankruptcy proceeding is over. That is not balanced. Once again, this bill gives special treatment to credit card companies at the expense of the most vulnerable members of our society. It is arbitrary and punitive. 
   This example shows how empty the proponent's arguments are when they claim that the bill gives first priority to alimony and child support. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee had a big chart listing all the ways that the bill supposedly helps women and children. But, as has already been mentioned by other Senators on the floor, 116 law professors have written to us to contest that claim. 
   Let me quote from their letter because I think it is very important to hear these arguments in some detail. The letter says:  
   Granting ``first priority'' to alimony and support claims is not the magic solution the consumer credit industry claims because ``priority'' is relevant only for distributions made to creditors in the bankruptcy case itself. Such distributions are made in only a negligible percentage of cases. More than 95 percent of bankruptcy cases make no distributions to any creditors because there are no assets to distribute. Granting women and children a first priority for bankruptcy distributions permits them to stand first in line to collect nothing. 
   Women's hard-fought battle is over reaching the ex-husband's income after bankruptcy. Under current law, child support and alimony share a protected post-bankruptcy position with only two other recurrent collectors of debt--taxes and student loans. The credit industry asks that credit card debt and other consumer credit share that position, thereby elbowing aside the women trying to collect on their own behalf. ..... As a matter of public policy, this country should not elevate credit card debt to the preferred position of taxes and child support.  
   Mr. President, what the law professors point out so convincingly is that the key issue is not how the limited assets of a debtor are distributed in bankruptcy, but what debts survive bankruptcy and will compete for the debtor's income when the bankruptcy is over. In a variety of ways, this bill will encourage reaffirmation agreements and increase nondischargeability claims which will lead to more debtors having more debt that continues after bankruptcy. 
   That is what hurts women and children, not the priority of child support claims in the bankruptcy itself. The priority of claims in the bankruptcy itself is almost meaningless since in the vast majority of bankruptcy cases there are no assets to distribute. People are broke, and they do not have anything to sell to satisfy their creditors. That is why they file for bankruptcy. You can't squeeze blood from a stone. 
   One of the most interesting things about this bill, as I have seen in other legislation as well in recent years, is the almost Orwellian names of some of its provisions. There are a number of them. For example, there is a title of this bill with the name ``Enhanced Consumer Protection,'' but many of the provisions in this title actually offer little, if any, protection at all. The weak credit card disclosure provisions are an example. Yes, those may be enhanced consumer protections, enhanced from nothing, but they are not considered sufficient by any organization, not one organization, whose primary concern is consumer protection. 
   There is another section with the so-called ``Enhanced Consumer Protection'' title called ``Protection of Retirement Savings in Bankruptcy.'' That sounds pretty good. What the provision actually does is put a cap on the amount of retirement 
   savings that is put out of reach of creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding. Before this bill, there was no limit at all on the amount of retirement savings that can be protected. So this bill is not an enhanced consumer protection at all. It is a step backward for consumers and hard-working Americans who tried to put aside some money for their golden years. 
   Incidentally, this provision is nowhere to be found in either the bankruptcy bill that passed the Senate or the bill that passed the House. This is one of those provisions that appeared out of nowhere. In fact, before a firestorm of criticism forced him to reconsider, the Senator who proposed this provision wanted to let consumers waive the existing protection of retirement savings in boilerplate consumer credit agreements. So the $1 million cap is an improvement over what the sponsors of this bill tried to do, but it is hardly a protection. 
   Here is another sort of Orwellian title. Section 306 is called ``Giving Secured Creditors Fair Treatment Under Chapter 13.'' It ought to be called ``Giving Certain Secured Creditors Preferred Treatment Under Chapter 13'' because it favors those who make car loans over other secured creditors and over unsecured creditors. 
   Here is how it works. There is, of course, a concept in bankruptcy law currently called cramdown or stripdown. It recognizes the fact that the collateral for some kinds of loans can lose value over time so it may be worth significantly less than the debt owed. Remember that in a bankruptcy proceeding, secured creditors get paid first, but the cramdown concept says to those creditors that they only get paid first up to the amount of the value of the collateral for the loan. After that, if they are still owed money, they have to get in line with the other unsecured creditors. 
   To give a more tangible example, if someone owes $10,000 on a car loan, but the car which is collateral for that loan is worth only $7,000 now, then only $7,000 of that loan is considered secured in a bankruptcy. That makes perfect sense since the maker of that loan has the right to repossess the car, but if it does that, it can only get $7,000 when it sells the car. 
   What the bill does is eliminate the cramdown for any car that is purchased within 5 years of bankruptcy. That means that even though the vehicle that secures the loan has lost much of its value, the entire amount of the debt must be repaid in a chapter 13 plan. This gives special treatment to the lender and, more importantly, it will make it much more difficult for a chapter 13 plan to work, and that will hurt people who want to pay off their debts in an organized fashion under chapter 13. 
   Most people file chapter 13 cases because they want to keep their cars. The cramdown allows them to reduce their car payments to a reasonable amount, leaving enough money to pay off other secured creditors and make a repayment plan work. 
   According to the chapter 13 trustees who know what they are talking about since they deal with these cases day in and day out, this single provision of the bill will increase the number of unsuccessful chapter 13 plans by 20 percent. 
   Making it more difficult to get chapter 13 plans confirmed will lead to more repossessions of cars and ultimately to more chapter 7 filings. Even where a chapter 13 plan can be confirmed and is successful, the anticramdown provision will reduce the amount a creditor can pay to unsecured creditors or 
   to child support or alimony. In essence, payments on a car worth far less than the debt are given priority over child support, another example of how this bill is arbitrary and punitive and how the claims of the bill's proponents that the bill will help women and children are empty indeed. 
   The anticramdown provision undermines the efficacy of chapter 13. All the experts tell us that. I have to point out the irony here. The avowed purpose of proponents of this bill is to move people from chapter 7 discharges to chapter 13 repayment plans. Yet the bill actually has the effect of undermining chapter 13. 
   There is even another provision in this bill that undercuts chapter 13. A small group of Senators who shaped  this bill in a shadow conference accepted a provision from the House bill that says for those debtors with income above their State's median income, chapter 13 plans must extend over 5 years rather than 3. That is a 66-percent increase in payments required to complete the plan. In view of the fact that the majority of 3-year plans fail, the requirement that the debtor go 2 more years without an income interruption or unexpected expenses will inevitably lead to an even higher rate of chapter 13 plan failures and discourage even more debtors from filing voluntarily under chapter 13. 
   As I have said before, this bill is really, in a way, at war with itself. Bankruptcy experts from around the country tell us clearly that it will not work. This bill will destroy chapter 13 as an option for many debtors. If we pass it, I am convinced we will be back here trying to fix it once it starts to take its toll on the American people. In the meantime, how many lives will be made harder? How much more heartache are we going to inflict on hard-working Americans? 
   I have spoken for quite awhile here about the problems with this bill. In fact, I am sorry to say, I have probably only just scratched the surface. This is an immensely complicated bill about a very technical area of the law. There are provisions in this bill that I would venture to guess that no one in this body really understands. Indeed, some of the statements by proponents of the bill indicate that they don't understand bankruptcy law or this bill. 
   This is the kind of bill where we need to rely on the experts to give us some real guidance. And we just have not done that here. Once again, we have a letter from 116 law professors. They are from all across the country. They are not debtors' lawyers, they are not all Democrats, they do not have an ideological agenda. They just understand the law and care about how it operates. And they are pleading with us. Let me quote from their letter:  
   Please don't pass a bill that will hurt vulnerable Americans, including women and children.  
   That is what the 116 law professors say. 
   This is extraordinary. The experts beg us to listen to them. They do not have a financial interest here. They do not represent debtors. None of them is in danger of declaring bankruptcy. They just hate to see this Congress make such a big mistake in writing the laws. They do not want us to ruin the bankruptcy system, which dates back to the earliest days of our country, by passing a bill that is so unbalanced, so arbitrary, and so punitive. 
   We have one last chance to listen to these experts, one last chance to step back from the brink of passing a very bad law, a law that I believe we will come to regret. It is a matter of simple fairness and simple justice. 
   I want to assure my colleagues that I am not opposed to reform of the bankruptcy laws. I know there are abuses that need to be stopped. I voted for a bill here in 1998 that passed the Senate with only a handful of votes in opposition. There are things we can do--and should do--to improve the bankruptcy system. There are loopholes we can close and abuses we can address. We can do it in a bipartisan way. We can write a balanced bill that the Senate and the country can be proud of. We can rely on the advice of experts, as we have always done in this complicated area in the past. But we did not do that here. We relied on the credit card industry, which has showered Senators and the political parties with campaign contributions, and it shows. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this unfair bill. This Senate can do better, and we will do better next year if this bill is defeated. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me begin by agreeing with the Senator from Minnesota. The measure before us is a work of injustice. It works injustice on the Senate's procedures. And if it passes, it will work injustice on millions of Americans struggling to cobble together a fresh start after financial hardship. And the measure is also a clear example of the power of money in the legislative process. That's an injustice too, because it puts the needs of the special interests ahead of the needs of the American people. 
   Let us begin with the procedural injustice. If Senators allow business to be done as is being attempted with this conference report, then we might as well all just go home. Because conference committees will be doing our jobs. 
   Unlike a normal conference report, this conference report includes absolutely no legislation on the matters that the Senate sent to the conference committee--which, for the information of my colleagues and the people watching, was a bill on embassy security and authorizations for the Department of State, a terribly serious matter. That was not what came back--nothing like that. Instead this conference report brings back to the Senate a complete bill entirely irrelevant to the bill sent to conference. What it brings back is a bankruptcy bill. 
   That is not the job of a conference committee. It is not the job of a conference committee to search out the legislative vineyards for whatever issues appear ripe for decision. It is not the job of a conference committee to write legislation on matters not committed to it. The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   The Constitution confers on the Senate and the House of Representatives certain enumerated powers. Article I, Section 1, of the Constitution provides: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.'' 
   If the Senate so chooses, it may delegate some of its powers to a committee of its Members. But if those Members so delegated recognize no limits on their authority, then they have usurped nothing less than all the powers that the Constitution vests in the Senate itself. The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs a full Senate and a full House of Representatives in Congress assembled? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs amendments between the Houses on the bankruptcy bill? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs the Senate to disagree to any House amendments or insist on any Senate amendments on the bankruptcy bill? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs the Senate to request a conference or agree to a conference on the bankruptcy bill? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs the Senate to consider any motions to instruct the conferees  on the bankruptcy bill? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs the Senate even to name conferees on the bankruptcy bill? The embassy security conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs for Congress to address the increase in the minimum 
   wage that the Senate attached to the last bankruptcy bill? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs for Congress even to take up, consider, debate, and amend this particular bankruptcy bill, which was introduced on October 11? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs for the Senate to take any action whatsoever to grant this conference committee power to act on bankruptcy? The conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs all the Senators who are not Members of the conference committee? Because the conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs for us to fly and drive in to Washington, sometimes from vast distances, from around the country? Because the conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   Who needs all these Senate offices and all the Senators' staff? A handful of offices would do, four to be exact, because the conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   As one longtime observer of Senate procedures asked, who died and made them king? Because the conference committee is doing our jobs. 
   The Senate used to have rules to prevent this sort of thing. Rule 28 of the Standing Rules of the Senate addresses conference committees. Two of that rule's six paragraphs deal with the scope of conferences. 
   Paragraph 2 of Rule 28 states, in relevant part:  
   Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not committed to them by either House. ..... If new matter is inserted in the report ....., a point of order may be made against the report, and if the point of order is sustained, the report is rejected or shall be recommitted to the committee of conference if the House of Representatives has not already acted thereon.  
   And then, paragraph 3 of Rule 28, dealing with complete substitutes, states:  
   3(a) In any case in which a disagreement to an amendment in the nature of a substitute has been referred to conferees, it shall be in order for the conferees to report a substitute on the same subject matter; but they may not include in the report matter not committed to them by either House. They may, however, include in their report in any such case matter which is a germane modification of subjects in disagreement.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the last time the Federal Government executed someone was in 1963. That year, the Federal Government executed Victor Feguer, who had kidnapped and killed a young doctor. At 5:30 in the morning of February 15, 1963, at Fort Madison, IA, a Federal hangman tied a noose around Feguer's neck and put him to death. 
   Feguer's execution was the first and last Federal execution of the 1960s. In fact, the Federal Government has carried out executions fairly infrequently during the entire twentieth century. Only 24 Federal executions took place between 1927 and 1963. One-third of those were for wartime espionage or sabotage. 
   But, Mr. President, all of that is about to change. In the next 2 months, two inmates on Federal death row could become the first to be executed by the Federal Government in nearly forty years. Their names are David Hammer and Juan Garza. 
   As many of my colleagues recall, Congress modernized the federal death penalty in 1988 and then significantly expanded it in 1994. Those votes are about to have very real consequences. Like it or not, the national debate over the death penalty is actually intensifying and will build further next month, the months after that, and in the year to come. 
   And we should have this debate. We should have this debate, because the Federal Government is heading in a different direction from the rest of the country. The States have learned some serious lessons about the administration of capital punishment, and the Federal Government, above all, should learn from them. 
   After the Supreme Court's 1976 decision reinstating the death penalty, most States swept the cobwebs off their electric chairs and resumed executions. And most of these states have not looked back since. Just last year, the United States set the record for the number of executions in one year in this modern death penalty period: 98 executions. And already this year, there have been 70 executions in the United States. 
   But recently, in States all across America, awareness has been growing that the death penalty system has serious flaws and that its administration has sometimes been far from fair. From Illinois to Texas to North Carolina to Pennsylvania, I believe that a consensus is building that there is a problem. Since the 1970s, 89 people--Mr. President, 89 people--who had been sent to death row were later proven innocent. Nine of these 89 were exonerated on the basis of modern DNA testing of biological evidence. Defendants have sometimes been represented by lawyers who slept during trial, were drunk during trial, or who were so incompetent that they were later suspended or disbarred. Prosecutorial and police misconduct sometimes have led to faulty convictions. The death penalty has been applied disproportionately to African Americans and the poor. The revelations of problems with the system mount. These are very real, serious problems that fail to live up to the fundamental principles of fairness and justice on which our criminal justice system is based. 
   Just last month, the Justice Department released data on Federal death penalty prosecutions. That Justice study showed racial and geographic disparities in the administration of the Federal death penalty. The study found that whether the Federal Government seeks the death penalty appears to relate to the color of the defendant's skin or the Federal district in which the defendant is prosecuted. Both the President and the Attorney General have acknowledged--they have acknowledged--that this data paints a disturbing picture of the Federal death penalty system. The Attorney General admits that she does not have answers to the questions raised by the DOJ report. 
   My colleagues may believe that the system is flawed, but some of them seem to fear that the people will object to efforts simply to address these inequities. The American people, however, are in 
   fact ahead of the politicians on this, as they are on so many issues. A majority of the American people are troubled. They are troubled by these flaws in the death penalty system that they support a moratorium on executions. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll taken this past July found that 63 percent of Americans supported a suspension of executions while questions of fairness are reviewed. And in a bipartisan poll released just this last month, 64 percent of Americans supported a suspension of executions while questions of fairness are reviewed. 
   Mr. President, as you have said and others have said, the Federal Government can often learn from the States. Let's apply that to the administration of the death penalty. 
   With so many nagging questions raised and still unanswered, how can the Federal Government go forward--how can the Federal Government go forward with its first execution in almost 40 years? 
   I believe it is unconscionable for the Federal Government to resume executions under these circumstances. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced two bills that would suspend executions  while an independent, blue ribbon commission simply reviews the death penalty system. The National Death Penalty Moratorium Act would suspend executions at the state and federal levels. The Federal Death Penalty Moratorium Act would suspend executions at the Federal level. And I am pleased that Senators LEVIN, WELLSTONE, DURBIN and BOXER have joined me on one or both of these bills. The five of us may not--in fact, do not--agree on whether the death penalty is a proper punishment, but we are united in our belief that our nation should pause and thoroughly review the system that has sent many who were later proven innocent to death row. 
   Addressing flaws in the death penalty system is, Mr. President, unfortunately, yet another chapter of the unfinished business of this Congress. With two executions scheduled for after adjournment, I must urge President Clinton to suspend Federal executions and order a comprehensive review of the Federal death penalty system. 
   Next Congress, when we return, I intend to reintroduce my legislation. I shall keep pushing forward on this issue. We have made progress this year, but we still have a long way to go toward restoring the integrity of our criminal justice system. I look forward to working with my colleagues toward that goal in the year to come.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise now to oppose yet another monstrous product that this majority has loosed on the Senate, this one an omnibus tax bill. In a number of speeches this year, as early as this May, I have tried to raise objections to the procedures that the majority is employing in this session of the Senate. It is proverbial that ``a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.'' If any more proof were needed that these procedures are bad, the fruit of this tax bill provides it. 
   Let me begin by recounting how bad the tree is that bore this bill. The procedures that the majority has employed to bring this bill to the floor are egregious. And when the majority employs the procedures that it has on this bill, it is not surprising that they yield such an unattractive outcome. What has happened? A small number of Senators and Congressmen, all from one party, have cooked up this bill behind closed doors. Of the bill's major provisions, none has enjoyed consideration on the Senate floor. The majority leadership has then shoveled the contents of this back-room agreement into a conference on a comparatively minor Small Business Administration loan measure. When the fruit of such a process has, as this bill has, experienced no discussion, no vetting, and no amendment, it cannot help but have some rotten parts to it. 
   And there is much that is rotten about this bill. It would spend, Mr. President, a significant amount of the surplus--about a quarter of a trillion dollars--before, before having taken any steps to save Social Security, or to reform Medicare, or to lock away on-budget surpluses to pay down the debt. Now, Mr. President, there are of course some provisions in this bill that I would support. But first and foremost, it is irresponsible to spend this much of the projected surpluses before having taken a single step to address our long-term fiscal responsibilities.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Beyond that, Mr. President, this bill is also blighted by its lack of fairness. As have so many of the other fruits of this majority, this tax bill would disproportionately favor the very wealthy. When we as Senators decide on tax policy, we must ask ourselves: With a limited amount of surplus available, whose taxes should we cut first? Should tax relief go first to the wealthiest among us? The majority answers ``yes'' every time. Instead of the Robin-Hood-in-reverse priorities of the majority, we should instead be seeking to direct tax relief first to those who need it most: the hard-working American middle-income family. 
   According to an analysis prepared by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, 64 percent of the benefits of this tax bill would go to the top one-fifth of the income distribution. And less than a fifth of the benefits of this tax bill would go to the bottom 60 percent of the population--one-fifth of the benefit to three-fifths of the people.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   And now, let me take a few moments to address particular sections of the bill. And let me begin with the health care 
   provisions of this bill, which, at $88 billion for the tax provisions alone, account for what is actually the largest component of this bill. We can all agree that health care should be a priority. But the health tax provisions of this bill are structured so that the vast majority of middle-income Americans will not be able to benefit from them. 
   This is so because the health tax provisions in this bill operate exclusively through the mechanism of tax deductions, instead of tax credits. Thus, Mr. President, it would provide no benefit for families of four making up to $32,000, and actually provide precious little benefit for families making up to $50,000. Those at the top of the income scale are not those who are having the most difficulty getting health insurance or paying for long-term care. 
   Indeed, the health care insurance deduction in this bill could actually reduce health care coverage. That is because the presence of the deduction might encourage private employers to drop health care coverage at the workplace.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Among its health provisions, this bill also includes spending legislation to restore health care cuts made in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I strongly oppose the provisions in the Medicare provider payment restoration bill that disproportionately allocate scarce Medicare resources towards Medicare health maintenance organizations--HMOs--and away from beneficiary and health care provider needs. 
   The Medicare HMO program already treats our Wisconsin seniors unfairly. I cannot support increasing payments to a system that treats Wisconsin's seniors like second class citizens. Not only are these increased payments unjustifiable, they would raise payments without any accountability provisions that would ensure there is actually planned participation in States like Wisconsin. 
   Congress should not dedicate over one-third of its Medicare spending to Medicare HMOs, when only 15 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs. 
   Instead of supporting HMOs, I strongly favor provisions that would support Wisconsin's seniors by preserving care through hospitals, home health care agencies, hospices, and other providers. The home health care provisions--I know firsthand from many conversations around the state--are especially inadequate, and do little to address the needs of rural beneficiaries and the most medically complex patients. 
   Let me turn now to the pension provisions, which, at $64 billion, make up the next largest part of the bill. The official estimates of the costs of these provisions are large, but they understate what will be the true costs of the bill. That is because the bill's so-called Roth IRA provisions, which allow taxpayers to pay some taxes now to avoid  paying more taxes later, bring funds into the Treasury in the early years at the expense of the outyears. The bill's costs will thus likely expand when fully phased in, and will likely grow particularly in just those years when the baby boom generation is retiring and we most need the resources to actually keep Social Security and Medicare solvent. 
   The bill's pension provisions expand individual retirement accounts or IRAs. Among other things, it raises the amount that individuals may contribute to IRAs, raises the maximum income for those who may contribute to an IRA, raises the maximum income for 
   those who may convert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, and allows individuals over age 50 to make larger catchup contributions. The bill makes similar changes in 401(k) plans, raising the amount that individuals may contribute to 401(k)s, allowing deferral of 401(k) tax treatment as with a Roth IRA, and allowing individuals over age 50 to make larger catchup 401(k) contributions. 
   Taken as a whole, these changes that I just listed would manifestly benefit the bestoff among us. A recent Treasury study found that just four percent of eligible taxpayers--largely the most affluent people eligible--make the maximum $2,000 contribution to IRAs under the existing law. By definition, these would be the only people within current income limits who would benefit from raising the contribution limit. And by definition, only those above current income limits would benefit from lifting the income limits. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy analysis, more than three-fourths of the benefits of the bill's pension and IRA provisions would go to the fifth of the population with the highest incomes. 
   The bill's proponents claim that the bill would also increase savings. But this claim is almost Orwellian. Lifting these limits would actually decrease saving, for three reasons. 
   First, by making it easier for wealthy business owners to do tax-favored saving as individuals, the bill would decrease their incentives to set up business-wide, business-wide 401(k) or pension plans to get those tax benefits. As a former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury testified:  
   Currently, a small business owner who wants to save $5,000 or more for retirement on a tax-favored basis generally would choose to adopt an employer plan. However, if the IRA limit were raised to $5,000, the owner could save that amount--or jointly with the owner's spouse, $10,000--on a tax-preferred basis without adopting a plan for employees. Therefore, higher IRA limits could reduce interest in employer retirement plans, particularly among owners of small businesses. If this happens, higher IRA limits would work at cross purposes with other proposals that attempt to increase coverage among employees of small businesses.  
   That is what the former Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy said. By depriving lower- and moderate-income employees of opportunities for tax-favored saving, the higher IRA limits would thus decrease saving by those employees. 
   Second, the savings contributed by high-income savers would tend to be money that they would have saved anyway. Rather than cause new saving among higher-income savers, the higher limits would merely substitute tax-favored saving for fully-taxed saving. Rather than increase saving among this group, the bill would thus just cut taxes for these higher-income savers. 
   And third, because the bill is not paid for and therefore spends surplus money, it reduces the surplus and thus reduces the amount by which the Government pays down the debt. When the Government pays down debt, it contributes to national savings. And thus by reducing the amount by which the Government pays down debt, the bill will worsen national savings. 
   When the Finance Committee considered a pension bill earlier this year, it did include a provision that might have helped increase saving, Mr. President. That section, championed by Democratic Members of the Finance Committee, would have actually provided a matching credit, a matching credit, for saving by low- and moderate-income savers making up to $50,000 for a couple. The provision was still deeply flawed, in my view, because it was not refundable, and therefore it was of no use to families of four making up to $32,000. But if Government action is to encourage increased private saving, it needs to be directed--as that credit was--to low- and moderate-income people, who are not saving now. 
   What has the majority done? The majority has stripped this 
   bill of that proposal. The majority has deleted from the bill that section most likely to increase private saving. 
   As well, the bill includes many offensive individual pension provisions. 
   Current law imposes additional requirements on plans that primarily benefit an employer's key employees, what are called ``top-heavy plans.'' These additional requirements provide more rapid vesting and minimum employer contributions for plan participants who are not key employees. The bill would relax these rules for top heavy plans in a number of ways. For example, fewer family members would be counted for the determination of whether a plan was top-heavy. This change in the bill would allow plans to provide greater benefits to owners and their families without providing minimum benefits and more-rapid vesting to rank-and-file workers. 
   The bill raises the limit on the amount of income that may be considered compensation for purposes of contributions to 401(k) accounts. This change would allow an employer who wanted to save a fixed amount each year to reduce the percentage contribution that all employees could make to their 401(k)s. 
   As I noted at the outset, the bill's Roth IRAs shift tax receipts from the distant future into the near future. They are thus fiscally very risky, as they drain tax revenues from the Government during the retirement years of the baby-boom generation, while giving us a false sense of additional revenues now. And they also benefit the very wealthiest among us. 
   Thus, the pension provisions of this bill would particularly benefit the very wealthiest. And I would assert that it is not a coincidence--I am afraid it is not a coincidence--that some of the most powerful wealthy interests in our campaign finance system are today pushing for this so-called pension ``reform.'' I would like to take a moment to direct my colleagues' attention to these big donors. 
   It is time again to ``call the bankroll.'' As I have said, this legislation doesn't benefit average working Americans who are counting on their pension when they retire, so exactly whom does it benefit? I think ``calling the bankroll'' could answer this. 
   I would like to do a truly comprehensive ``calling of the bankroll'' here, but that would be almost impossible. There are just too many wealthy interests behind this tax bill: financial interests, insurance companies, and labor unions, just to name a few. We could be here all day, or all week, if I tried to cover all those contributions. So in the interest of time, I will just review the unlimited soft money contributions of some of the interests pushing for this bill. 
   The figures I am about to cite come from the Center for Responsive Politics. They include contributions through the first 15 months of the election cycle, and in some cases include contributions given more recently in the cycle. 
   Some of the biggest investment and finance firms are supporting passage of this bill. 
   For example, Merrill Lynch, its executives and subsidiaries, have given more than $915,000 in soft money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
   That's just one company. 
   Mr. President, I have other examples I will cite regarding the ``calling of the bankroll.'' American Express, its executives and subsidiaries have given more than $312,000 in soft money so far in this election cycle. And Fidelity Investments and its executives have given at least $258,000 in soft money to date. 
   The American Benefits Council, which is strongly supporting this bill, sent around a list of supporters of provisions of the legislation. That list includes still more big donors. 
   The American Council of Life Insurers and its executives have given more than $260,000 to the parties' soft money warchests during the period.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is just a shame that we have managed to get to the year 2000 election without having any significant action on campaign finance reform. We did take the first tiny step in the right direction on a strong bipartisan vote by doing something about disclosure by these 527 groups that were sort of a scam in the making, but we did not address the need to ban soft money which the overwhelming majority of both Houses support and the President is ready to sign. It is a glaring failure of this Congress. 
   Everybody else in the country knows, including those who supported the campaign of the Senator from Arizona for President on the Republican side, that soft money is a real cancer on the system. But somehow, again, the Congress is behind the people. I can't help but note, in answer to the question, that we are going to make a very important decision in the next few days on who the next President of the United States should be. The candidate of the Democratic Party, AL GORE, has pledged to make the McCain-Feingold ban on soft money the first piece of domestic legislation he will introduce, and he has pledged to work for it and sign it when Congress passes it. The candidate for the Republicans, Governor Bush, apparently is prepared to veto it.  
   So the tragedy, in answer to the question, of this Congress not acting is that if somehow Mr. GORE is not elected, we may finally get the 60 votes we need to break the filibuster but we will have a President who is not ready to do something about the corrosive and corrupting influence of money in politics. Of course, the Senator knows from my work on this, that I consider this to be one of the two or three greatest problems in our society. We just have to do something about the corrupting effect of money on our political and legislative system.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is absolutely right. Let me make it clear, the ban on soft money that Senator MCCAIN, I, and a majority of this body support, bans corporate contributions, union contributions, and unlimited individual contributions. It is fair and balanced. 
   The Senator from Nevada is absolutely right. People who might be listening to this discussion might say: Well, these kinds of contributions have always been allowed anyway. That is not true. These kinds of unlimited contributions by corporations, unions, and individuals really didn't exist for purposes of these television ads until 5, 6 years ago. This is a new corrupting influence on our system, the likes of which has not been seen since the turn of the last century. I refer to the turn from the 19th to the 20th century. In answer to the question of the Senator from Nevada, that is what led to the 1907 Tillman Act which prohibited contributions by corporations in connection with federal elections, and then, when the unions came into their prominence in the middle part of the century, the Taft-Hartley Act said unions also must be prohibited from giving contributions. 
   All we are trying to do is put the genie back in the bottle. Unlimited contributions have always been considered inappropriate in our system of government, and shame on this Congress that we 
   can't see the worst corrupting influence in 100 years and that we didn't, before the turn of the century, shut it down, because it must be shut down. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of the greatest public servants among us: DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. For 24 years he has lent us the wisdom of his experience, the insights of his keen mind, and above all, the honor of his friendship. Senator MOYNIHAN reminds all of us what a Senator was intended to be. He is a leader who not only addresses the needs of his state, but who wrestles with the challenges facing the nation. Senator MOYNIHAN has been a great servant to the people of New York, but the legacy of accomplishments he leaves reach beyond New York's borders to touch the lives of every American. 
   With a brilliant intellect and an unwavering dedication, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN has helped us think through some of the toughest issues before this body, from welfare reform to taxation policy. He has worked to return secrecy to its limited but necessary role in government, an effort which I applaud. And he has lent his support to ``The Fisc,'' the annual compilation of the balance of payments between the states and the federal government, which brings needed attention to the ``donor'' status of New York, Wisconsin and other states. He has done a great service to our understanding of federal spending with his longtime support of this effort. 
   Recently, I was proud to work with Senator MOYNIHAN on the Mother-to-Child HIV Prevention Act of 2000, S. 2032, the substance of which was incorporated into the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000, and signed into law in August. It was an honor to work with him to get this legislation to the President's desk. Senator MOYNIHAN's keen grasp of foreign affairs, as well as his mastery of domestic and urban issues, will be missed as he retires from the Senate. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN's lifetime of public service, his wisdom and experience, have been a wonderful gift to this body. I know my colleagues join me in my admiration for Senator MOYNIHAN as a public servant, my respect for him as a colleague, and my appreciation for him as a friend. It has been a distinct honor for me to serve with Senator MOYNIHAN since I came to this body in 1993. PAT, I wish you all the best as you retire from the U.S. Senate, and I look forward to your continued contributions to the nation as one of the greatest political thinkers of our age.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the career of Connie MACK as he retires from the Senate. Senator MACK has served the people of Florida with distinction during his two terms in the Senate, as well as during his three terms in the House of Representatives. Throughout his career in public service, Senator MACK has been willing to address complex issues and help move the debate forward. 
   On matters of fiscal policy, Senator MACK and I have not often agreed, but I have admired his willingness to engage these issues in a serious way that fosters the kind of discussion we need in the Senate to deliberate on the difficult questions before us. 
   Senator MACK has been a steadfast advocate for increased NIH funding, and I have been proud to support his efforts, including his proposal, passed as an amendment to the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution, to double funding for NIH over the next five years. I share his belief that increasing funding for biomedical research is one of the most important ways we can improve the quality of life for America's families. Groundbreaking research, development of drug therapies and new medical procedures, all of these steps move us closer to life-saving medical breakthroughs that can detect, prevent, and eliminate life-threatening disease. 
   I have also been pleased to support Senator MACK's effort, along with Senator GRAHAM, to restore the Everglades. His work to preserve and restore this unique and beautiful area, home to fragile habitats and many endangered species, will undoubtedly be one of his greatest legacies. 
   It has been a pleasure to serve with Senator MACK over the last seven years. As he leaves the Senate, I wish him all the best and thank him for his many years of distinguished public service.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when I first heard that BOB KERREY had decided not to run again, I knew the Senate was losing a true American original, and a big part of what makes the Senate special. 
   From my first moments in the Senate back in 1993, there was one thing I could tell right away--BOB KERREY is a true leader. In an age of poll-driven politics, BOB KERREY isn't afraid to ruffle a few feathers to raise the level of debate and work for the greater good. He has sparked debate on the big issues: saving Social Security, controlling federal spending, guaranteeing the right to health insurance, and helping the poor, just to name a few. 
   I was proud to work with him on the bipartisan deficit reduction package he spearheaded with former Senator Hank Brown of Colorado, and I'm proud to have a colleague with such a sincere commitment to fiscal responsibility. He fought to balance the federal budget when others said it could not be done. As Chair of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, BOB KERREY directed our attention to the long-term challenges that we need to heed.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as this Congress draws to a close, I want to take a moment to thank my friend FRANK LAUTENBERG for his 18 years of service in the body. The people of New Jersey are losing a skilled legislator and a gifted advocate. Whether he is fighting racial profiling or taking on the tobacco industry, FRANK LAUTENBERG has consistently fought for a healthier, safer, more just world for all of us. 
   After a successful career in the private sector, FRANK ran for the U.S. Senate motivated to give something back to his state and the nation. And never has he had greater success than during his 18 years in public service. It has been a pleasure to serve with Senator LAUTENBERG on the Budget Committee, where he has provided outstanding leadership as the committee's ranking member. Senator LAUTENBERG played a crucial role in crafting the bipartisan budget agreement of 1997 which led to the balanced budget, and putting this body back on the road to fiscal responsibility. 
   I stood side by side with Senator LAUTENBERG in the fight to implement the gift ban in 1995. And I've been especially proud to work with him to end racial profiling--the abhorrent law enforcement practice that targets African Americans, Hispanic Americans and other minorities for traffic stops based on the color of their skin. Together Senator LAUTENBERG and I introduced S. 821, the Traffic Stops Study Act, to require the Attorney General to conduct an initial analysis of existing data on racial profiling and then design a study to gather data from a nationwide sampling of jurisdictions. We've worked together on this issue for more than two years, and I believe our legislation will prevail, if not in this Congress, then in the next one. 
   I will proudly continue the fight to pass the Traffic Stops Study Act in the next Congress, but I will miss greatly FRANK's leadership on this issue. When we do finally pass this simple bill to get an accurate picture of racial profiling on our nation's roadways, we'll owe a big part of that victory to Senator LAUTENBERG. 
   Today I thank FRANK LAUTENBERG for his leadership on racial profiling and so many other issues that matter to the people of this nation. I wish him and his family all the best in his retirement, and thank him for his many contributions to the U.S. Senate, and to the American people.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the conference report on the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. 
   I reluctantly voted against that conference report, because it contained a provision dramatically increasing the budget caps, effectively throwing fiscal discipline to the wind. 
   But I want to go on record indicating that, if the amendment busting the budget caps had not been included in the bill, my vote would have been an enthusiastic yes. Substantively, this is a remarkably good bill, and I commend the managers, Chairman MCCONNELL and the ranking member, Senator LEAHY, as well as Chairman Callahan and Congresswoman PELOSI for their excellent work. 
   An unprecedented commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS abroad and full funding of the Administration's request for debt relief initiatives are among the many laudable provisions in the bill that complement this year's authorizing work of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   The conference report contains significant assistance for important family planning work, which can help to bring better health and economic development to families and especially to women around the world. Moreover, I am pleased to see that the bill does not contain restrictive, so-called ``Mexico City'' language designed to limit what private organizations can do with funds raised from non-U.S. government sources. 
   During the debate on the Senate's version of this bill earlier this year, I asked for, and received, the commitment of Senators MCCONNELL and LEAHY to pursue full funding for flood recovery assistance in Mozambique and southern Africa, a region of the world utterly devastated by a series of cyclones earlier this year. This was especially tragic, because prior to the flooding, Mozambique had been making progress toward climbing out of poverty, enjoying economic growth rates of 10 percent per year. I want to thank both Senators for keeping their word. This conference report contains $135 million in flood recovery assistance for the region. This is the right thing to do. 
   I took a particular interest in the southern Africa issue, in part because I serve as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on African Affairs. In that same capacity, I have joined with a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to insist that the Administration make accountability a top priority in the context of our policy towards Sierra Leone. I am gratified to note that the statement of the managers accompanying the conference report includes language urging the State Department to provide support for the Special War Crimes Court for Sierra Leone. The support of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee for this key Congressional priority in West Africa should not be overlooked. 
   In another area of interest, I note that the conference report retains language suspending certain types of military and security assistance to Indonesia until a set of conditions relating to the disarmament and disbanding of militia forces and accountability for gross human rights abuses have been met. At the same time, it maintains an appropriate level of assistance for the people of East Timor, who are seeking to rebuild their communities and to fully realize their independence each day. 
   Finally, the conference report provides strong support for the Peace Corps and for important development assistance accounts which, when responsibly administered and monitored, can serve U.S. interests in building a more stable, prosperous, and democratic world. 
   All of these sound provisions make it all the more unfortunate that the bill has been tainted with the budget-busting amendment, so that my vote would have been an accurate reflection of my support for this bill. Too often in the past, the Congress has failed to understand the critical link between U.S. engagement with the rest of the world and our national interests--our security, our health, our economic stability, and even our national values. This bill recognizes those links and moves in the right direction. It's a shame that a bill that makes such sensible policy choices, so casually busts the budget caps that we rely upon to ensure fiscal responsibility.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. My amendment is supported by the administration because it improves the bill. It actually makes the bill comply with Federal reclamation and environmental laws. It makes it clear that only the features of the latest version of the Animas-La Plata Project will be constructed, and the result of that, my colleagues, will be a better return for the taxpayers than the underlying measure. This is important. 
   The Ute and Navajo tribes will have their claims settled and paid for, even under my substitute, 100 percent by the Federal Government, but the nontribal water recipients will have to repay their share of the construction, fish and wildlife mitigation, and recreation costs. That kind of repayment is only fair. It is what other water users and other projects such as the California central valley and central Utah have to pay. 
   If my colleagues will look at the fact, this is not unprecedented. This is actually the way other water projects are handled now. The water users have to pay these fair costs. This amendment not only does not kill the bill, it just makes sure there is a fair opportunity for court review. The bill does not undercut; the non-Native American users actually pay 
   their fair share. 
   Most importantly, this greatly expanded project that has now been scaled down to a reasonable level does not somehow get put back into this large wasteful project. It is both strong in terms of environmental concern and very strong in terms of the taxpayers. 
   I hope by supporting this, my colleagues, the Senator from Colorado could have this water project that he has worked on for so long, but that it be done in a responsible way which the administration supports.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the substitute offered by my colleague from Colorado, Mr. CAMPBELL. I do so fully acknowledging that the Animas-La Plata project, as outlined by the Senator from Colorado's substitute amendment, has undergone a significant modification from its original configuration. What was a more than $750 million dam, reservoir, pumping plant, and associated pipelines and irrigation components, is now proposed to be a much smaller and less costly reservoir project to satisfy the Ute and Navajo claims and provide water delivery to the Navajo Reservation. The scaled-down project is now a $278 million project to build a reservoir and pipeline according to the administration's Record of Decision released on September 25, 2000. 
   The Senator from Colorado and I have shared an interest in settling the Utes' claims for many years. We agree that those claims must be settled and that construction of a reservoir is an acceptable way to achieve that goal. Moreover, he has worked to accomplish that objective. In passing his substitute, Congress will be seeking to downsize the project to effectuate a settlement that satisfies the tribes water needs at 100 percent Federal cost, which is appropriate. However, and I want to make this clear to colleagues, the sized-down project also provides a significant new water supply for non-tribal municipal and industrial use. The Senator from Colorado's substitute amendment guarantees that about 35 percent of the water held in the reservoir would be stored for use by non-tribal interests: 10,400 acre feet for the San Juan Water Commission; 2,600 acre feet for the Animas-La Plata Conservancy District; 5,230 acre feet for the State of Colorado; and 780 acre feet to the La Plata Conservancy District of New Mexico. 
   So this legislation is not solely an Indian water rights settlement. The Senator from Colorado and I differ in our opinions as to how the nontribal entities should be treated in this legislation, and that is why I am offering my amendment today. I want to make sure that the outcome Congress is ``seeking'' to implement through this legislation is one that it actually finds. I have three reasons for offering this amendment, which I will describe in a little bit of detail. 
   First, I remain concerned that the substitute only does half the job with respect to making sure that the taxpayers are off the hook for the original full-scale project. Those who support the construction of the Animas-La Plata project now want to proceed with an alternative which they believe to be a cheaper and scaled-down version of the original project. They want to do so, however, without expressly deauthorizing the original project. It appear to me that proponents won't give up the authorization for the original project because it provides them with the ultimate insurance. Should this alternative be infeasible, retaining the original authorization would allow a fallback position for proceeding with the old project. My amendment makes it absolutely clear that Congress is granting its approval only for the scaled-back year 2000 version of the project and not the original 1956 version of the project. 
   By deauthorizing all additional features of the old project, Congress would ensure that no such project features or components could be built without a demonstration by the project proponents that such features meet specific economic and engineering standards designed to protect the Federal Treasury, public safety and welfare. The Reclamation Project Act of 1939 requires engineering feasibility reports, cost estimates and economic analyses for a ``new project, new division of a project, or new supplemental works on a project *.*.*'' A project which is not authorized would be considered a ``new project, new division of a project, or new supplemental works on a project'' and be subject to the planning and reporting requirements. The substitute of the Senator from Colorado allows a future Congress to give its approval for a project or part of a project which has previously been authorized as part of the Animas-La Plata project as described in the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956.  So, what it comes down to without my amendment, it is not clear that the additional construction would be subject to any feasibility requirements. I think taxpayers have a right to know that information. 
   Moreover, newly authorized projects are also subject to the Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Land Resources Implementation Studies--known as ``Principles and Guidelines''--promulgated pursuant to the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965. The Principles and Guidelines are the seminal policy statement requiring Bureau projects to integrate full economic cost recovery, financial and economic feasibility principles, and protection of the environment into planning for water resource projects. The Principles and Guidelines are the bridge between the old era of costly and economically ruinous Bureau projects and a new era of careful, resource protective planning. Many Members of this 
   body fought hard to ensure these reforms would move forward. The old full-size Animas-La Plata project has not been analyzed under the Principles and Guidelines. One of the key criticisms of the old project has been the Bureau of Reclamation's failure to utilize the current discount rate, the cost of any electric power revenues produced by the project, and other economic variables in its studies. So if my amendment becomes law, any future features would be subject to the planning requirements of the Principles and Guidelines. 
   The second point of my amendment is that it requires that nontribal water users actually pay recreation and fish and wildlife costs. The nontribal project proponents have argued that because section 8 of the Colorado River Storage Project Act of 1956 makes recreational and fish and wildlife costs nonreimbursable for the projects it authorized, they should not have to repay such costs. ALP in its original, 1956, design, with no Indian water rights purposes or beneficiaries, was authorized by CRSP. I believe that the nontribal water users should pay these costs for a couple of reasons. 
   First, the administration's Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for ALP takes the position that the version of the ALP project now being proposed for construction is so significantly different in size, features and purposes that the limitation in section 8 of CRSP does not apply. Page 5, Section 1.8 of that appendix states:  
   A contemporary determination of reimbursable and non-reimbursable project costs is justifiable based on the significant re-defining of the current project's purpose and limitation of water use as well as current Administration policies.  
   Second, as the just-quoted language implies, the policy of the current administration, as well as the policy of preceding administrations throughout the 1980s and 1990s, has been to seek reimbursement of recreation and fish and wildlife mitigation costs of Federal water projects. There are numerous examples, such as the Garrison project, Central Utah Project, and the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. Many Members of this body worked hard to enact these reforms. In fact, obtaining reimbursement for recreation and fish and wildlife mitigation costs has been an element of Federal policy dating back to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1946, Federal Water Project Recreation Acts of 1965 and 1974, and various Water Resource Development Acts, most notably WRDA 1986. 
   Obtaining reimbursement for fish and wildlife and recreation costs is far from unprecedented, and, in fact, is consistent both with contemporary policy and with the actual practice of recent years. We are authorizing a smaller project today, and that smaller project should be held to year 2000 reimbursement standards. 
   In addition to making clear the intent of Congress to require the repayment of fish and wildlife costs, my amendment further clarifies the amount of construction costs that the nontribal water users have to repay to the Federal Government. The substitute of the Senator from Colorado gives the nontribal water users the right to prepay for construction. At the end of the construction they are given the choice of electing whether to make a second payment to settle their account with the Federal Government. If they choose to enter into a new contract, under the terms of the substitute, they are required to only repay construction costs that are ``reasonable and unforeseen.'' I think that allowing a second bite at the apple by giving water users the option of not making the second payment is a big enough gift from the taxpayers. I have repeatedly opposed prepayment because I believe and feel that the taxpayers often get stuck for contract delays and cost overruns. I am concerned that the substitute opens the door to allowing the definition 
   of ``reasonable and unforseen'' to be argued in court. My amendment makes it clear that, when the final tally is levied, even though that is a practice I find questionable, it should include all of the costs--all the costs--the Federal Government has incurred. 
   Third, and finally, I remain concerned that the findings in section 1(b) of the substitute may have the unintended effect of influencing a court's review of the sufficiency of agency compliance with Federal environmental laws applicable to the Animas-La Plata project. My amendment adds language to the bill to make sure that tampering with court review does not occur. 
   Colleagues may say, well, these are only findings in the bill. What effect could they possibly have on a court? I would ask my colleagues to first ask themselves what other purpose these findings could possible have in this bill that is not to have influence on a court. 
   Second, these finds are a compromise from the prior version of S. 2508, which included explicit determinations by Congress entitled ``compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act'' and ``compliance with the Endangered Species Act of 1973'' and which relied in part upon the findings. These sections have been deleted from the substitute, but the findings remain as determinations by Congress that could be used to attempt to influence judicial review of compliance with environmental laws. 
   For example, the finding in section 1(b)(5) states in effect that the passage of S. 2508 is ``in order to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.'' The finding that Congress has reviewed all of the environmental studies--section 1(b)(8)--in combination with the finding that Congress has decided to enact S. 2508 to implement the Record of Decision that resulted from those environmental studies--section 1(b)(10)--would have the effect, I am afraid, of influencing a court's review of a challenge to the adequacy of the studies or the soundness of the decision contained in the Record of Decision. 
   Indications of Congress's substantive views about a proposed project, as expressed in the legislation authorizing the project, have been used by the federal courts in evaluating whether the project complies with applicable federal environmental laws. Because the findings in S. 2508 appear to be designed to influence judicial review, as explained above, and because the precise intent of the findings is open to interpretation, a reviewing court could ascribe little weight, extreme weight, or no weight at all to these findings during the course of ruling upon a citizen suit. 
   To neutralize this potential impact upon a reviewing court in a subsequent citizen challenge to environmental compliance, I propose to add language, so that section 2(a)(1)(B) will read:  
   Nothing in this Act shall be construed to predetermine or otherwise affect the outcome of any analysis conducted by the Secretary or any other federal official under applicable laws, to restrict the availability or scope of judicial review, or to in any way affect the outcome of judicial review of any decision based on such analysis.  
   I believe overall that this amendment in all its parts will make this bill better. It commits the Federal Government solely to the construction of a reservoir and protects the taxpayer. It preserves the right of courts to review the project's environmental compliance and it ensures that the nontribal water recipients pay their fair share. So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me briefly respond to my colleague's remarks. Let me, first, indicate not only am I not insensitive to the needs of Colorado, my mother is a native of Colorado, who did not come to Wisconsin until she came to college. I have great affection for the State and certainly respect the water needs that are so central to the State and to Western States. 
   Let me respond to the specific points because I think we have worked together well to try to narrow our differences and to come up with this agreement in a way to try to have these matters discussed on the Senate floor in an expeditious way and to have  a vote and to have the matter go forward as appropriate. 
   The first point the Senator seemed to put his greatest emphasis on was whether or not the non-Native American users of the water should somehow be put in the same position of others who were the beneficiaries of the previous projects that were based in 1956. He suggested that somehow it would be discriminatory for these individuals and families to have to pay certain costs that the others did not have to pay in the past. I suppose that is one way to look at it, but I really look at it a different way. 
   I don't see the people who have benefited from some of these water projects in the past as really the relevant group. The relevant people now are those of us here today, both those who need the help of the water, the Native Americans and others, but also the taxpayers today. To not alter the repayment system for this is to ignore the reforms that have occurred since 1956. 
   There has been an effort and success in legislating a different way to handle this, to make sure that some of these expenses are reimbursed. I understand there may be those in this situation who may believe it is unfair that they are not put in the same position as those in the past, but I don't really understand how that is as important or relevant as making sure the taxpayers of today are not unfairly being discriminated against by having to pay more than they should for this project. 
   The Senator from Colorado even alluded in his initial remarks to the fact that he could at least understand the criticism of some of the past water projects. I think that same argument holds for some of the failure to reimburse on some of the past water projects. 
   This is not just my idea. I want to assure you that the OMB in this matter in their report on the Animas La-Plata project indicated this kind of reimbursement is entirely appropriate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am not talking about something that is actually discriminatory. It is simply inconsistent with the law and the policy with regard to how these projects should be handled today to protect taxpayers--not in 1956. 
   Second, the Senator from Colorado talked about the fact that, yes, our bill does try to make sure that this project, since it has been scaled down--and I give the Senator credit for that--in fact, that is what we authorized. We don't leave the door open for sort of behind-the-scenes reauthorization of this. 
   He does point out clearly that in certain contexts it would be necessary to actually formally reauthorize the project for additional aspects of the project. 
   But my understanding is--and the reason we offered this is--if this current scaled-down project is not built, there would not be a requirement of a new authorization; that the situation would revert back without the need for more authorization for the much larger project. I believe it was something like $750 million. 
   It is not that the Senator is wrong about the fact that there are some situations where there might be the requirement for an authorization in the future. But if it isn't built--the Senator has alluded to the possibility it wouldn't happen--if, in fact, his central complaint is that it hasn't happened, and if it doesn't happen, we don't go back to an open process to figure out what this ought to be. It automatically gets reauthorized. 
   That is what troubles me. That is what I want to nail down. I want to make sure this project actually fits the size it needs to be and the people who need the help will get the help they deserve. 
   Finally, the Senator spoke about the third part of our amendment. In fact, in our amendment we want to make sure there is the opportunity for the full judicial review that is appropriate in situations such as this. 
   The Senator says the bill does nothing to undo the possibility of additional review. But I have raised the concern about some of the findings that are placed in the bill and why those findings would be there if they were not in some way to influence the court. 
   I accept his statement. That is not his intent. 
   All we are trying to do is have some language, which I read into the Record. It is very simple. It states clearly that the information and findings should not be used in a way that would preclude the court from using the current laws that apply to this situation. 
   That is all. It certainly does no harm to the Senator's position--unless, in fact, there is something in the bill that is intended to prevent the courts from having the full opportunity to review that they now are required to do under current law. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I respect the Senator's time, and I want to keep my promise. 
   I want to be absolutely clear in the Record. There is absolutely nothing in the amendment I am proposing that in any way breaks the promise to the Utes and others who will certainly benefit from this project. We are very careful about that. 
   But it talks about the size of the project. It is a project that the Senator from Colorado has agreed to as a scaled-down project. But surely he is not suggesting that he is breaking a promise to anybody with that proposal; therefore, neither am I by suggesting it be that size. 
   I just want to be sure that somehow we do not end up with a wholly larger project later on, which the Senator from Colorado has agreed to leave aside, and certainly make sure that various reimbursements become, under law, a standard practice in these kinds of situations. Certainly, that is not a breach of a promise. 
   This is the law of the land and the way we do these things at this point to protect our taxpayers. Surely, it is not a breach of a promise to suggest that there ought to be a chance for the kind of judicial review that should occur in situations such as this. 
   In fact, I would suggest to the Senator--because I think we work together well on this--that I promised months ago that my goal here was not to put a hold on the bill so it could never come up. All I said was I would like an opportunity to offer some amendment. We worked together. I agreed to a time limit, which is exactly what is happening here. The promise was kept in that regard as well. 
   I am trying to be constructive and improve this bill. And the administration agrees. Even though they agreed fundamentally with the legislation, they also agree that my amendment is not harmful, but is, in fact, beneficial in making the bill better in the context of keeping our promises. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a few moments about the subject of race in America. I want to speak today about how sometimes it seems that whites and African-Americans are living in different Americas. And I want to speak about how we still need to do more to see that we become one America. 
   There is a movie playing now in the theaters called Remember the Titans. That movie depicts how there were two Americas, not that far from here, not that long ago. It depicts the great civil rights struggle of school integration, through the lens of a high school football team in 1971, at T.C. Williams High School, just across the river from here in Alexandria, Virginia. 
   The film stars Denzel Washington as Herman Boom, who became head football coach at all-white T.C. Williams High School, when it was just beginning to integrate. Although some in the white community in Alexandria did not welcome integration, in the film, Coach Boom steps into this tempest, and teaches the players and coaches to overcome racial prejudice. He teaches the players to respect each other and to work together as a team, regardless of the color of their skin. In the end, the team conquers racial barriers and goes on to win the state championship. Titans teaches us that we must be willing to confront our prejudices, so that we can build a better America, together. 
   Since 1971, we have made significant progress in public education. But we still have a long way to go. And we are still failing in other areas, like the treatment of African Americans and Latino Americans by law enforcement agencies. They have become the targets of racial profiling. It is time for us to confront our prejudices, to address racial profiling. 
   White Americans have not had similar experiences. We live in a different America. We won't be stopped on the side of the road, at the airport, or while walking through our neighborhoods, based on the color of our skin. We live in an America where we are free to move about. But African Americans, Latino Americans and Americans of other racial or ethnic groups do not live in this same America. They live in an America where they do not have freedom of movement. When it comes to the enforcement of our laws, they surely live in a completely different America. 
   Mr. President, racial profiling is a terrible practice. It's unfair, unjust and un-American. It should be thoroughly reviewed, so that we can determine how to end it. 
   Mr. President, racial profiling casts its net so far and wide that its victims include Americans regardless of their education, wealth, or status. Just last month, that net caught Bob Nash and his wife Janis Kearney, both very high-level officials at the White House. Montgomery County police in suburban Washington pulled over Mr. Nash and his wife, who are both African American. The officers drew their guns. The officers asked them to step out of their car. And the officers handcuffed them. 
   Why? Well, as far as I can see, the only thing that they were guilty of doing was ``Driving While Black.'' They were stopped, questioned and handcuffed for no apparent reason other than the color of their skin. This is an outrage for Mr. Nash, Ms. Kearney, and all Americans who live in a nation that guarantees liberty and justice for all. 
   At the end of last month, the San Diego police department released a study of traffic stops that found its officers are more likely to stop and search African and Hispanic Americans than whites and Asian Americans. And earlier this month, according to a story that appeared on the front page of the New York Times, a Federal investigation of the New York Police Department's Street Crime Unit determined that its officers engaged in racial profiling in recent years as they conducted their aggressive campaign of street searches in New York. More and more the evidence mounts. 
   African Americans and other minority Americans have been on the receiving end 
   again and again, of this horrendous practice. It is intolerable. And it screams out for action by the Federal Government. The Senate should take the first step toward ending this terrible practice by passing S. 821, the Traffic Stops Statistics Study Act. 
   This bill was introduced in the House by Representative JOHN CONYERS and in the Senate by my distinguished colleague and friend from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG. I commend them for their leadership on this issue, and I am proud to have been able to join them in this effort. 
   The Traffic Stops Statistics Study Act would require the Attorney General to conduct an initial analysis of existing data on racial profiling and then design a study to gather data from a nationwide sampling of jurisdictions. This is a reasonable bill. It simply requires the Attorney General to conduct a study. It doesn't tell police officers how to do their jobs. And it doesn't mandate data collection by police departments. The Attorney General's sampling study would be based on data collected from police departments that voluntarily agree to participate in the Justice Department study. 
   In fact, since our traffic stops study bill was introduced in April 1999, we have already seen significant, increased recognition in the law enforcement community of the need for and value of collecting traffic stops data. Over 100 law enforcement agencies nationwide--including state police agencies like the Michigan State Police--have now decided to collect data voluntarily. Eleven state legislatures have passed data collection bills in the last year or so. So this is tremendous progress from where we were when the bill was introduced. I applaud those states and law enforcement agencies that are collecting data on their own. 
   But more can be done. And more should be done. Indeed, the state and local efforts in this area underscore the need for Federal action. Not all states and law enforcement agencies have undertake data collection efforts. A Federal role is critical for Congress and the American people to understand the extent of problem nationwide. This effort can lay the groundwork for national solutions to end this horrendous practice. 
   Mr. President, I certainly believe this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. Governor George W. Bush supports data collection. During the second presidential debate, he said, ``we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.'' He also said, ``we need to find out where racial profiling occurs.'' His own Department of Public Safety in Texas has begun collecting data. And Vice President GORE, as well, has been a forceful leader on the issue. All Americans can agree that racial profiling is unfair and unjust and that we need to better understand the scope of the problem. 
   Our Nation has come a long way in the struggle to live up to its highest ideals of liberty, justice, and equality for all. Congress, historically, has  played a critical role in addressing racial discrimination, through legislation that grappled with civil rights issues like voting rights and employment discrimination. Americans are once again calling on the Congress to combat racial discrimination. With this legislation, we can take a step in the right direction, a step closer to becoming truly one America. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Traffic Stops Statistics Study Act, and to back its enactment this session.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Wartime Violation of Italian American Civil Liberties Act. While the American people generally know about the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, they are largely unaware of the U.S. government's mistreatment of people of other ethnic backgrounds during this difficult time in our nation's history. I believe we need a complete and thorough review of our government's mistreatment of Americans during World War II. 
   Mr. President, S. 2442 is a worthy bill. I had some reservations about this bill because it is not as inclusive as it might have been. The U.S. should fully assess its treatment of all Americans of European descent during World War II, including Italian and German Americans, as well as European refugees fleeing persecution, to acknowledge those whose lives were unjustly disrupted and whose freedoms were violated and to discourage the future occurrence of similar injustices. 
   I recognize, however, that time is short in this session of Congress. So, I will not object to H.R. 2442 going forward at this time. But I want my colleagues to know that by withholding an objection at this time, I am not abandoning my effort to make sure that the mistreatment of other Americans during World War II, including German Americans, and European refugees are also properly recognized and reviewed. I look forward to working with Senator HATCH and my colleagues on this issue next year.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Sense of the Congress amendment on contaminated sediments offered by the Senator from California (Mrs. BOXER). I do so because I have concerns about the implications that the report language accompanying this bill may have for the remediation and restoration of the Fox River in my home state of Wisconsin. 
   My staff has tried repeatedly over the last several days to clarify the report language with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and has been unable to do so. I had wanted a letter from the EPA explaining the impact of this language on the Fox clean-up. In fact, my office was told by the Office of General Counsel that the EPA could not state with certainty the effects of this language on the Fox River, because it was one of the clean-ups that they had identified which might be delayed by this report language. This leaves me with concern that the next few actions Wisconsin is about to take to clean up the Fox River may be delayed, and my concern is shared by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. 
   As members of this body know, the Senate's version of the VA-HUD bill did not contain any report language on sediments. Only the version which passed the other body contained report language on this issue, and this language is retained and modified in the report accompanying this bill. Therefore, I also raise concerns, Mr. President, because my Wisconsin colleague in the House (Mr. GREEN), who represents the Fox Valley, tried to clarify the House report language in a floor colloquy when the measure was considered in the House of Representatives. This bill before us now changes the very language my colleague from Wisconsin specifically tried to clarify, and adds new and explicit time lines which do not mesh with the upcoming actions that will be taken to clean up the Fox River. As a Wisconsin Senator, I have no choice but to try to enhance the understanding of what this language would do, and I believe that the amendment by the Senator from California (Mrs. BOXER) makes it clear that Congress intends the EPA to move swiftly to clean up contaminated river and ocean sites. 
   I want to explain the status of the Fox River clean-up. The Fox River is currently not a National Priority List (NPL) site, commonly known as Superfund site. Nonetheless, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) is working to develop a final Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RIFS) and is expected to release that study in late December, 2000 or early January, 2001. The Wisconsin DNR intends to release the final RIFS jointly with the EPA, and the other trustees which include: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin. A final Record of Decision (ROD) could be reached between March and early June, 2001. 
   If the National Academy study is not yet complete and ``properly considered'' by EPA before the final RIFS is issued, as the Conference Report language requires, the report language is unclear about whether public comment can be initiated on the final RIFS. The report language says that public comment can be taken on ``proposed'' or ``draft'' remediation plans but is unclear with respect to comment on a  final RIFS. Further the language says that ``no plans are to be finalized until June 30, 2001 or until the Agency has properly considered the National Academy of Sciences report, whichever comes first.'' Potentially stalling comment on the final RIFS raises concerns, as the final RIFS will finally indicate a preferred alternative for cleaning-up the Fox, an alternative which was not indicated in the draft RIFS. Interests on all sides of this issue--the paper companies that are potentially responsible parties in the clean-up, local governments that are concerned about liability, and local citizens who have been waiting to see what will be done to address the contaminants in the river--deserve to know what the preferred alternative is and to express their views. 
   Moreover, if the final ROD is issued before June 30, 2001, its implementation could also be delayed by this language. Though some may view this as simply a delay of a few weeks, I remind my colleagues that Wisconsin is a cold weather state. My State needs the certainty of being able to plan to contract to implement the remedy during the summer and early fall construction season. If not, we risk having to put off the clean up for another calendar year due to cold weather delays. 
   Given these uncertainties, I support my colleague from California's (Mrs. BOXER) amendment. This report language may have consequences for my state which I simply feel must be addressed.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will once again oppose the Department of Defense authorization bill, as I have done each year I have been a Member of this body. 
   As I stated earlier this year when the Senate passed the fiscal year 2001 Department of Defense appropriations bill, my opposition to this conference  report should not be interpreted as a lack of support for our men and women in uniform. Rather, what I cannot support is the cold war mentality that continues to permeate the United States defense establishment. 
   I strongly support our Armed Forces and the excellent work they are doing to combat the new threats of the 21st century and beyond. However, I am concerned that we are not giving our forces the tools they need to combat these emerging threats. Instead, this conference report, like the corresponding defense appropriations bill that has already been enacted, clings to the strategies and weapons that we used to fight--and win--the cold war. 
   The cold war is over. It is past time that we undertake a comprehensive review of the threats currently facing the United States and formulate a strategy on how best to combat them before we continue to commit billions of dollars to programs that were created to fight an enemy that no longer exists. 
   As we reexamine our defense priorities, we should assess the changing roles and missions of both our active duty and our reserve components. The National Guard and Reserve are integral parts of overseas missions, with recent and ongoing missions in places including Iraq and the Balkans. According to statements by Department of Defense officials, Guardsmen and Reservists will continue to play an increasingly important role in our national defense strategy as they are called upon to shoulder more of the burden of military operations both at home and abroad. The National Guard and Reserves deserve the full support they need to carry out their duties. 
   One crucial part of that support is providing adequate compensation to these dedicated men and women. I am pleased that this conference report includes a modified version of an amendment I offered during Senate consideration of this bill which authorizes special duty assignment pay for members of the National Guard and Reserve not on active duty. This provision will provide a measure of pay equity to National Guard and Reserve personnel by making them eligible for special duty assignment pay for special duties performed during drill periods. 
   The men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves are cornerstones of our national defense and domestic infrastructure, and they deserve to be adequately and equitably compensated for their dedicated service to this country. This provision is a step in that direction. I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services for their cooperation and support on this important issue. 
   On another matter, I am also delighted that this bill permanently extends the authority of the General Services Administration, GSA, to convey surplus property to local governments for law enforcement purposes. This provision builds on an amendment I offered when this measure was before the Senate, and I am pleased that the conferees have retained the language and expanded its scope. This section will help a number of communities across the country seeking to use surplus property to protect their citizens and provide safe, secure facilities for their police departments. Without this amendment, the authority to convey surplus property for law enforcement purposes would have expired this year. Communities that want to use the GSA process, and have counted upon doing so, to negotiate the use of property for law enforcement purposes at a reduced cost would have been shut out. 
   In fact, I have just such a situation in my own home State. The city of Kewaunee, WI wants to acquire the city's Army Reserve Center, which is a former Federal armory building. The city intends to use the property as a municipal building in which they would house their police force and other municipal offices. 
   Congress has specified a number of public purpose uses for which property can be transferred to local governments at a reduced cost. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, FPASA, allows property to be transferred to public agencies and institutions at discounts of up to 100 percent of fair market value for a number of purposes: public health or educational uses, public parks or recreational areas, historic monuments, homeless assistance, correctional institutions, port facilities, public airports, wildlife conservation, and self-help housing. This type of transfer is called a public interest conveyance. 
   I strongly believe that law enforcement is an important public purpose for which surplus property should be used. Moreover, in fairness to local communities with tight budgets, Congress today is acting to permanently preserve this option for communities that are counting on being able to use this authority. 
   Mr. President, I again thank the bill's managers, the Senior Senator from Virginia [Mr. WARNER] and the Senior Senator from Michigan [Mr. LEVIN], as well as the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. THOMPSON], for assisting me in ensuring this provision becomes law. 
   In closing, I reiterate my concern about the excessive spending contained in this conference report, including millions in taxpayers' dollars for planes, ships, and other equipment that the President did not request. 
   We should reexamine our defense priorities, and we should do it as soon as possible. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer my sincere condolences to the families of the U.S. Navy personnel killed in what appears to have been a terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole, and to express my outrage at this cowardly act of murder. This deplorable incident is a tragic reminder of the risk and sacrifice assumed by all of our men and women in uniform, and by their families. I know that the administration will be using all of the resources at its disposal to discern who is responsible for the attack, and that the U.S. will resolutely take appropriate action in response to this incident. 
   My certainty about that last point is based on a simple and irrefutable truth. No country would stand by while its soldiers and sailors are targeted and killed. The U.S. will certainly not stand for it and will not be intimidated in the wake of the cowardly attack on the Cole. By the same token, it should surprise no one that Israel retaliated in response to the brutal murder of Israeli soldiers at the hands of a mob in Ramallah. 
   But as difficult as it is, as raw as emotions are right now, we cannot afford to lose sight of one fundamental fact. All of us--we Americans, the rest of the international community, the Israelis and the Palestinians--know that there is no military solution to the terribly difficult issues that have made the Middle East a region of tension and violence for far too long. In recent days the promise of peace has been obscured by terrible violence in Jerusalem and elsewhere. Nearly 100 lives have been lost, including the lives of children. For the Israeli and Palestinian children who remain, in the name of providing them a future free from these horrors, I hope that the Israeli and Palestinian people will find  the courage and the strength to stop the violence, and that they will find their way back on a path toward peace.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator from Tennessee for having the courage to speak out against this ill-advised legislation known as Aimee's law. I say he has courage because there is a lot of emotion involved in any debate concerning serious violent crime such as murder, rape, or other sexual offenses. Some have said it is dangerous to vote against, much less speak against, any crime bill that is named after a real person. That is certainly the case here in this incredibly tragic case that underlies this legislation. 
   I also know that anything goes in a conference, including adding provisions for political reasons that do not withstand even the most basic scrutiny of whether they will work or can even be understood by the people or the entities that are supposed to abide by them. 
   I am sorry to say that Aimee's law is bad law--perhaps well intentioned--but bad law. I will support the Thompson point of order in order to state my objection to this provision. 
   The young woman who inspired this bill was tragically raped and murdered in Pennsylvania. A shocking crime was committed against her, against her family, and, indeed against all of us. All of us in this body feel horrible about that crime and its consequences. 
   But that does not absolve us of the duty to analyze legislation that comes before us, even if it bears the name of a child who was tragically killed. This legislation violates important principles of federalism. It will handcuff our states in their fights against violent crime. And most important, it just won't work. It won't accomplish what its sponsor and supporters say they want to accomplish. So I support Senator THOMPSON's point of order and hope my colleagues will as well. 
   Before turning to the bill itself, let me again compliment the Senator from Tennessee. He has shown time and time again that his commitment to federalism is principled and real. He does not oppose federal intrusion into state affairs as a political tactic, as I fear so many of my colleagues do. He truly believes that our states deserve autonomy and is willing to stand up for them, even when it is politically unpopular, as it no doubt is here. 
   I want the Senator from Tennessee to know that I respect his principles as well as support them. We miss his judgment and restraint, I must say, in the Judiciary Committee on which he served until the beginning of this Congress. 
   Here, of course, we are not preparing to pass a new federal murder, rape, or sexual offense statute. But we might as well do that because in Aimee's Law we are forcing the states through the use of federal law enforcement assistance funds to increase their penalties for these offenses. Since when is it the province of the federal government to determine the sentences for state crimes? That is what we are doing here. 
   Mr. President, in addition to furthering the federalization of the criminal law, this provision is very poorly thought out. As the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments and the Department of Justice have told us, it won't work. Even if states wish to comply with this 
   law they won't be able to do. 
   Here's why: Under this bill, if a person who has been convicted of a murder, rape or dangerous sexual offense is released from prison and commits a serious crime in another state, the original state becomes liable to the second state for all the costs of investigation, prosecution, and incarceration of the second crime. To avoid that liability, which the Attorney General must enforce through reallocation of the second states' federal law enforcement assistance funds, the second state must comply with two conditions. 
   First, it must make sure that persons convicted of these serious offenses serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. So far, so good. States can comply with that federal sentencing requirement if they want to avoid risking their federal money. But the federal coercion doesn't stop there. The state must make sure that the average sentence for the original crime is greater than the average sentence for such crimes in all the states. This is a remarkable condition, Mr. President, that actually makes it impossible for all 50 states to be in compliance at any one time. 
   Now Mr. President, think about this. Suppose a state determines that its average sentence for rape is 20 years, but the average for all states for that crime is 25 years. So the state raises its sentence to 26 years. That act will  itself change the average sentence for all the states, possibly putting other states under the average and encouraging them to raise their sentences. The average sentence for all the states will therefore almost never be constant or predictable. Every time a state changes its sentencing guidelines to try to get above the average, the average will change and other states will be forced to revise their own sentences. We will have rolling averages and no certainty in sentencing or in the availability of federal money for important state law enforcement purposes. 
   And that does not even take into account that the average sentence for an individual state will even sometimes change as different criminals are convicted and sentenced to slightly different terms. So the averages that states are supposed to keep track of in order to keep their law enforcement assistance funds will literally change day by day. This bill is an administrative nightmare for our states, even if they want to comply.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. After setting out a number of the difficulties of complying with this bill, Secretary Jon Litscher concludes the following:  
   Given the complexity of administering this bill and pitting one state against another, I don't believe this legislation will enhance the criminal justice system.  
   I believe that Mr. Litscher's view is shared by criminal justice professionals all over the country, along with Governors and other elected officials, all of whom are working just as hard to reduce violent crime as the sponsors of this bill. 
   I cannot leave this topic of how this provision creates a ``race to the top'' in sentencing without commenting on how it will effect the death penalty. Currently, 38 states have the death penalty for some crimes. That is more than half the states. Now I am not sure how you calculate an average sentence when some jurisdictions use the death penalty. But there would certainly be a strong argument that the states that do not use the death penalty will risk losing federal law enforcement assistance funds if a convicted murderer is let out on parole and commits another serious crime. Basically, this policy could force states to either enact the death penalty or never release a person convicted of murder on parole. 
   Now maybe that is what some people want. But I believe that whether to impose the ultimate penalty of death should be up to the states and their citizens. Federal coercion has no place in this question of conscience. A number of states, including my own, have long and proud histories of opposition to the death penalty. We should not use federal funds to force them to change their positions. 
   If this bill had gone through the Judiciary Committee, some of the difficulties in interpreting and applying it might have been worked out. Here all the negotiating has gone on behind closed doors. This is what happens when the normal legislative process is circumvented as it has been so often this year. It's now the norm for the majority to look for conference reports as vehicles for bills that they want to enact without going through the legislative process. 
   We used to have a rule, as my colleagues know, that prevented items from being added to a conference report that were beyond the scope of the conference. Last year, the minority leader offered an amendment to restore the rule, but it was voted down on a near party line vote. 
   So now, anything goes in a conference, including adding provisions for purely political reasons that don't withstand even the most basic scrutiny of whether they will work, or can even be understood by the people or entities that are supposed to abide by them. I am sorry to say that Aimee's law is bad law. Perhaps well-intentioned, but bad law. I will support the Thompson point of order in order to state my objection to this provision. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I join my colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, in paying tribute to the life of our colleague, Congressman Bruce Vento. I learned of the Congressman's passing upon my return to Washington. I send my condolences to his wife Sue and his family, along with all of the people from the great state of Minnesota who mourn and who thank him for his many years of service in the House of Representatives. He is deserving of special praise in recognition of his tremendous efforts to use his status as a federal legislator to bring a voice to the voiceless and to defend such interests as environmental protection, human rights, working families and community building. 
   Congressman Vento's career was a truly a remarkable one. He and I shared a profound affection for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, a place special to so many Wisconsinites and Minnesotans. Congressman Vento bravely agreed to chair the Ely field hearings on the creation of the Boundary Waters wilderness in 1977, a courageous decision for someone who was a Freshman member of the House at the time, and was a vocal champion of that wilderness throughout his career. As I work on wilderness issues, I am often reminded of Congressman Vento's comments on the House floor during consideration of the Boundary Waters bill. He said, ``there ought to be an opportunity where someone can go and have some solitude, where someone can go and have an experience that is different.'' 
   Congressman Vento used his career to work to protect that ``different'' opportunity for all Americans in the Boundary Waters, the Arctic Refuge, Southern Utah and many other special wilderness areas. These places and the people who cherish them, myself included, owe him a great debt. 
   I also had the privilege of working closely with Congressman Vento in this session of Congress on the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act which is now federal law. Congressman Vento was actively involved in getting that legislation through the House. 
   I join with the Senate in letting Congressman Vento's family know how grateful we are for having known him, and how committed we are to ensuring that the causes to which he gave his heart and his career remain protected.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the alarming situation in the Ivory Coast. 
   When General Robert Guei seized power in a coup last December, he indicated that he intended to hand over power to a civilian government quickly. Instead, and despite the urging of distinguished African heads of state from South Africa, Nigeria, and Senegal, Guei has chosen to run for President from his position of illegitimate authority, in which he can manipulate his own chances of electoral success. 
   Last Friday, the Ivory Coast's Supreme Court issued a ruling barring all but five of twenty candidates seeking to run in Presidential elections slated for later this month. The ruling disqualified popular opposition leaders, most notably Former Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara, and the former ruling party's candidate, Emile Constant Bombey. Notably, Guei's former legal advisor is now serving as the court's chief. The upcoming elections are looking more and more like political farce, and General Guei's credibility is in tatters. 
   Leading up to the Court's ruling, the General Guei's government took actions clearly intended to intimidate the opposition, instituting a state of emergency, banning opposition politicians from international travel, and executing sweeps to round up immigrants who have consistently supported elements of the opposition. The junta that claimed it stepped into power to save the country now appears committed to a course of destruction. One of Africa's most stable and important economies is threatened by the instability exacerbated by the junta's political machinations, and General Guei's attempts to rally popular support have been characterized by misguided, xenophobic rhetoric aimed at threatening foreigners in a country that depends upon an immigrant workforce. 
   The people of the Ivory Coast deserve far better than this. At its core, democratic government is about trusting citizens to choose their own destiny, not about manipulating and restricting the choices available to them. The West African region, currently engaged in a struggle between the forces of democracy and those of thuggery, certainly does not need another thinly disguised dictatorship in its ranks. The only interests served by the junta's behavior are their own.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret that I must oppose the Conference Report on H.R. 4475, the Transportation Appropriations Act, because it contains a number of provisions that I support. Others have noted the amount of special interest spending that was included in this bill. While I understand and share the desire of others to respond to particular local concerns, the level of such spending in this bill has become so great that it undercuts the efforts we made in the last Congress to bring more equity to the way transportation dollars are distributed. 
   Mr. President, beyond that I am greatly disappointed that this measure also includes a provision that is effectively a mandate on States with respect to blood alcohol levels. This issue is classically a matter of State discretion, and the Federal government has no business engaging in what amounts to little more than extortion to impose a policy on States in an area that is so clearly a State matter. 
   Mr. President, I have come to the floor before to talk about the disturbing trend toward the federalization of matters that should be left to state and local governments to decide. We have seen this in a number of policy areas, including our criminal justice system, but perhaps no area has been the subject of more inappropriate Federal intervention than transportation. From speed limits to seat belts, from helmets to blood alcohol levels, Congress effectively has usurped State authority to set public policy in this area. 
   Mr. President, I was privileged to serve in the Wisconsin State Senate for ten years, and I can tell you that state legislators like to have something to do. State legislators and governors are fully capable of understanding the arguments made in favor of adopting the .08 standard, and the Congress should not interfere with a policy matter that is so clearly a State prerogative. 
   Again, Mr. President, I regret I cannot support this measure. Adequate funding for the full spectrum of our transportation infrastructure is one of my highest budget priorities. But the inclusion of the blood alcohol standard puts that very needed funding at risk for states like Wisconsin that have a different policy. As with the special interest provisions that are included in this measure, it undermines the great strides that were made as part of TEA 21 to get Wisconsin a fairer portion of the revenue Wisconsin taxpayers contribute to the transportation fund.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am delighted that the conference report for Interior appropriations before this body today makes a significant investment in Wisconsin's only unit of the National Park System, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The Lakeshore recently celebrated its 30th anniversary on September 26, 2000, and I rise today to express my gratitude to the Senior Senator from West Virginia (Mr. BYRD) and the Senator from Washington (Mr. GORTON) for working with me to ensure that some of the highest priority needs at the Lakeshore are met. 
   I have been raising the need for these funds since 1998. On April 22 of that year, I introduced legislation, named for former Senator Gaylord Nelson who was the sponsor of the federal legislation that created the Lakeshore, to try to make sure that the Park Service has the funds included in this bill today. This bill helps to fund a wilderness suitability study of the Lakeshore as required by the Wilderness Act. Most of the Lakeshore is managed as wilderness, yet the required study has not yet been completed so that Congress can evaluate whether there is a need for a formal legal designation. This bill retains amendment language that I offered during the Senate consideration of Interior appropriations and provides $200,000 for that purpose. 
   The bill also provides funds to the Park Service to protect the history Raspberry and Outer Island lighthouses which are threatened by erosion. The 21 islands of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore have six lighthouses, the greatest number of lighthouses on any property in federal ownership anywhere in the country. They are all at least 100 years old, and many of them are still used as aids to navigation and are in need of Federal help.  
   By providing funds in this bill to ensure the success of the Lakeshore we contribute to another larger success--our efforts to clean and protect our environment and provide places for people to rest and refresh themselves. I have been very pleased in the willingness of the bill's managers to support my efforts to draw attention to this park. They have other, bigger parks that also have funding needs. But the managers understood my appeal on behalf of the people of Wisconsin with these funds. They know, as I do, that when the American people sit among the hemlocks on Outer Island, walk along the shore, travel to Devils Island, observe the waters of Lake Superior, they know protection of the Apostles is worth a federal investment. 
   The investments in the Apostles are authorized investments, part of the requirements that we gave the Park Service when we created the Lakeshore. As delighted as I am that these funds have been included by the managers, I remain concerned about the fact that this bill provides funds and policy direction for unauthorized projects, authorizes new projects and continues to contain a number of policy riders that affect environmental protection. Because these riders remain, I will vote against the bill. 
   I am concerned that this body is becoming habituated to the practice of environmental legislation by rider. This leaves Members of this body, like myself, who are very concerned about legislation which has the potential to adversely effect the implementation of environmental law, or change federal natural resource policy, with limited options. We must, by either striking the riders, or trying to modify their efforts, do the work of the authorizing committees on the floor of this body. With limited floor time on spending bills, and with the pressure to pass appropriations bills or risk shutting down or disrupting important Government programs, we do not do the best by the environment that we can and must do in our legislative efforts. 
   I believe that the Senate should not include provisions in spending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially environmentally beneficial regulations from being promulgated by the federal agencies that enforce federal environmental law. 
   For more than two decades, we have been a remarkable bipartisan consensus on protecting the environment through effective environmental legislation and regulation. I believe we have a responsibility to the American people to protect the quality of our public lands and resources. That responsibility requires that the Senate express its strong distaste for legislative efforts to include proposals in spending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially beneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated or enforced by the federal agencies that carry out Federal law. 
   Every year I hold a town hall meeting in each one of Wisconsin's 72 counties. When I hold these meetings, the people of Wisconsin continue to express their grave concern that, when riders are placed in spending bills, major decisions regarding environmental protection are being made without the benefit of an up or down vote. 
   When this bill passed the Senate initially on July 18, 2000, I was one of two Senators to vote against it because of legislative riders. I know that the bill managers worked long and hard to keep a number of the most controversial riders, many of which I was concerned about, off of this bill and I commend them for that. However, I am also concerned that there is a category of riders to which we have become habituated: riders on Alaska red cedar, riders on mining regulations, riders on grazing permits. There are also new authorizing provisions in this bill, such as developing forensic laboratory service fees for Fish and Wildlife investigations into wildlife mortality, and a new program to develop a reduced fee program for developing a reduced fee program to accommodate nonlocal travel through the National Park System. Why aren't these matters being discussed in the authorizing committees? These issues may have merit, but I think they should be handled by the committees of jurisdiction. 
   We cannot continue to put the Appropriations Committee in the position of having to decide which of these riders are more or less important. These measures need to be referred to the authorizing committees, and we need to restore the trust of the American people that we are proceeding with the people's business in a fashion which allows for open debate and actual deliberation. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was born in 1953, the same year that major league baseball made its way back to Milwaukee. I grew up with County Stadium and the countless memories it produced. 
   When the stadium and I were just six years old, Milwaukee County bore witness to one of the most dramatic games in baseball history. Pittsburgh's Harvey Haddix, pitched 12 perfect innings and lost both the no-hitter and the game to Milwaukee in the 13th. 
   When the stadium and I were eight years old, the legendary Warren Spahn had a spectacular year. He became the second oldest pitcher to throw a no-hitter and became only the 13th pitcher in history to win 300 games. 
   When the stadium and I reached 20, the Green Bay Packers won their very first Monday Night Football game. Wisconsinites never forget the last game the Packers played at county stadium nearly six years ago today. 
   On the year of our nation's bicentennial, when the stadium and I were 23, Hank Aaron hit his 775th and last career home run there. His home-run hitting presence and uncanny style added so much to County Stadium and the aura that surrounded him will never be forgotten. 
   When the stadium and I reached the age of 45, it was at County Stadium that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both hit their 65th home runs. 
   And finally, at our ripe age of 47, we must say farewell. Fortunately, its great and storied past will always be in our memories. I look forward to sharing with my family and Brewer fans across the state, the many new thrilling baseball moments that await us at Miller Park.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senate has just concluded its fourth vote in favor of the bill expanding H-1B visas that America grants each year to people from other countries to work in certain specialty occupations. I supported the bill on each of these votes. 
   But I rise today to express how strongly I oppose the manner in which the 
   majority leader has sought to constrain this debate. I oppose the way in which the majority leader sought, on that bill, as with so many others, to prevent Senators from offering amendments. And I oppose the majority leader's effort to stifle debate by repeatedly filing cloture on the bill. 
   Through his extreme use of cloture and of filling the amendment tree, I'm afraid the majority leader has reduced the Senate to a shadow of its proper self. And the result has been a Senate whose legislative accomplishments are as insubstantial as a shadow. This body cannot long exist as merely a shadow Senate. 
   Yesterday, as he brushed aside calls that the Senate vote on minimum wage or a patient's bill of rights, the majority leader complained that the Senate had already voted on those matters. But the Senate has, as yet, failed to enact those matters, and the people who sent us here have a right to hold Senators accountable. 
   And what's more, by blocking amendments, the majority leader has also blocked Senate consideration and votes on a number of issues that have been the subject of no votes in the Senate this year. Let me take a few moments to address two of them, the reform of soft money in political campaigns, and the indefensible practice of racial profiling. 
   Let me begin my discussion of these two items that the Senate was not allowed to take up--campaign finance and racial profiling--by discussing how those matters relate to what the Senate did take up--the H-1B visa bill. 
   The proponents of the H-1B bill characterize it as a necessity for our high tech future. It is both more and less than that. 
   But in a sense, the high-tech industry is certainly a large part of the reason why the Senate considered H-1B legislation these past two weeks. I would assert, that there is a high degree of correlation between the items that come up on the floor of the United States Senate and the items advocated by the moneyed interests that make large contributions to political campaigns. 
   American Business for Legal Immigration, a coalition which formed to fight for an increase in H-1B visas, offers a glimpse of the financial might behind proponents of H-1Bs. As I've said, I am not opposed to raising the level of H-1B visas. But I do think it's appropriate, from time to time, when the weight of campaign contributions appears to warp the legislative process, to Call the Bankroll to highlight what wealthy interests seeking to influence this debate have given to parties and candidates. 
   ABLI is chock full of big political donors, Mr. President, and not just from one industry, but from several different industries that have an interest in bringing more high-tech workers into the U.S. I'll just give my colleagues a quick sampling of ABLI's membership and what they have given so far in this election cycle. All the donors I'm about to mention are companies that rank among the top employers of H-1B workers in the U.S., according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
   These figures are through at least the first 15 months of the election cycle, and in some cases include contributions given more recently in the cycle: 
   Price Waterhouse Coopers, the accounting and consulting firm, has given more than $297,000 in soft money to the parties and more than $606,000 in PAC money candidates so far in this election cycle. 
   Telecommunications giant Motorola and its executives have given more than $70,000 in soft money and more than $177,000 in PAC money during the period. 
   And of course ABLI is comprised of giants in the software industry, who have also joined in the political money game. 
   The software company Oracle and its executives have given more than $536,000 in soft money during the period, and its PAC has given $45,000 to federal candidates. 
   Executives of Cisco Systems have given more than $372,000 in soft money since the beginning of this election cycle. 
   And Microsoft gave very generously during the period, with more than $1.7 million in soft money and more than half a million in PAC money. 
   But I should also point out, Mr. President, that the lobbying on this issue is hardly one sided. 
   Many unions are lobbying against it, including the Communication Workers of America, which gave $1.9 million in soft money during the period, including two donations of a quarter of a million dollars last year. And CWA's PAC gave more than $960,000 to candidates during the period. 
   The lobbying group Federation for American Immigration Reform, or ``FAIR,'' has lobbied furiously against this bill with a print, radio and television campaign, which has cost somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million, according to an estimate in Roll Call. 
   This is standard procedure these days for wealthy interests--you have to pay to play on the field of politics. You have got to pony up for quarter-million dollar soft money contributions and half-million dollar issue ad campaigns, and anyone who cannot afford the price of admission is going to be left out in the cold. 
   Thus, I believe that campaign finance is very much tied up in why the Senate considered the H-1B bill these past two weeks. I believe that campaign finance is very much tied up in why the Senate considered the H-1B bill under the tortured circumstances that it did. This is just another reason why I believe that this Senate must consider and vote on amendments that deal with campaign finance reform. 
   The momentum is building on campaign finance reform. In recent days, more and more candidates have offered to swear off soft money and have called for commitments from their opponents  to do without soft money in their campaigns. More and more candidates are coming to the realization that taking soft money is a political liability. The days of soft money are numbered, and this shadow Senate cannot long hide from the political reality. 
   Beyond that subject, there are other important subjects that the majority leader is blocking with his heavy-handed tactics. The Senate may just have considered a bill dealing with immigrants, but the Senate has thus far failed to consider a discussion of a particular injustice that could well affect their lives, as well. 
   The INS's May report showed that most of those for whom they approved H-1B visas during the period for which data were available came here from countries of the developing world. As a large number of those receiving H-1B visas are people of color, many could become subject to the indefensible practice of racial profiling. 
   If this Senate can find the time to consider H-1B legislation, I believe that it should also find the time to consider an amendment that addresses the issue of racial profiling. 
   Let me begin my discussion of racial profiling by acknowledging the leadership of Congressman JOHN CONYERS and our friend in this body, Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG, the principal authors of the legislation to address this very real problem. 
   The problem is this: Millions of African Americans, Hispanic Americans, immigrants, and other Americans of racial or ethnic minority backgrounds who drive on our Nation's streets and highways are subject to being stopped for no apparent reason other than the color of their skin. 
   This practice, known as racial profiling, targets drivers for heightened scrutiny or harassment because of the color of their skin. Some call it ``DWB,'' ``Driving While Black,'' or ``Driving While Brown.'' Of course, not all or even most law enforcement officers engage in this terrible practice. The vast majority of our men and women in blue are honorable people who fulfill their duties without engaging in racial profiling, but the experience of many Americans of color has demonstrated that the practice is very real. 
   There are some law enforcement agencies or officers in our country who have decided that if you are a person of color, you are more likely to be trafficking drugs or engaged in other illegal activities than a white person, despite statistical evidence to the contrary. In a May 1999 report, the American Civil Liberties Union reported that along I-95 in Maryland, while only roughly 17 percent of the total drivers and traffic violators were African American, an astonishing 73 percent of the drivers searched were African American. The legislation that Senator LAUTENBERG and I have sponsored would allow us to get an even better picture. 
   In America, all should have the right to travel from place to place free of this unjustified government harassment. None should have to endure this incredibly humiliating experience--and sometimes even a physically threatening one--on the roadsides or in the backseat of police cruisers. 
   This practice also damages the trust between law enforcement and the community. Where can people of color turn for help when they believe that the men and women in uniform cannot be trusted? As one Hispanic-American testified earlier this year in Glencoe, IL, after his family experienced racial profiling, ``Who is there left to protect us? The police just violated us.'' 
   Racial profiling chips away at the important trust that law enforcement agencies take great pains to develop with the community. When that trust is broken, it can lead to an escalation of tensions between the police and the community. It can lead to detrimental effects on our 
   criminal justice system--like jury nullification and the failure to convict criminals at all--because some in the communities no longer believes the police officer on the witness stand. Racial profiling is bad policing, and it has a ripple effect whose consequences are only beginning to be felt. 
   In just the last year and a half, since we introduced the traffic stops statistics study bill, we have already seen increased awareness of this problem in the law enforcement community, and an increased willingness to address it. A growing number of police departments are beginning to collect traffic stops data voluntarily. Over 100 law enforcement agencies nationwide--including State police agencies like the Michigan State Police--have now decided to collect data voluntarily. Eleven State legislatures have passed data collection bills in the last year or so. This is tremendous progress from where we were when the bill was introduced. I applaud those states and I applaud law enforcement agencies that are collecting data on their own. 
   But these State and local efforts underscore the need for a Federal role in collecting and analyzing traffic stops data to give Congress and the public a national picture of the extent of the racial profiling problem and lay the groundwork for national solutions to end this horrendous practice. While we can applaud individual states and law enforcement agencies for taking action, combating racial discrimination is one area where a Federal role is essential. Our citizens have a right to expect us to act. 
   I am pleased to have joined my distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG, in introducing S. 821, a companion bill to the bill introduced in the House by Representatives JOHN CONYERS and ROBERT MENENDEZ. The bill would require the Attorney General to conduct an initial analysis of existing data on racial profiling and then design a study to gather data from a nationwide sampling of jurisdictions. 
   This is a straightforward bill that requires only that the Attorney General conduct a study. It doesn't tell police officers how to do their jobs. And it doesn't mandate data collection by police departments. The Attorney General's sampling study would be based on data collected from police departments that voluntarily agree to participate in the Justice Department study. 
   I cannot emphasize enough that this traffic stops study bill is a truly modest proposal. Some would even say it's a conservative proposal. The American people have become so much more aware of the issue over the last year, and so many law enforcement agencies and State governments have expressed interest in addressing the issue, that many people are now saying that a study bill does not go far enough. They argue that we have enough data; we know racial profiling exists; we do not need to study it more; let's just end it. I understand this sentiment. This is a modest, reasonable proposal that, I hope, will lay the groundwork for developing ways to end racial profiling once and for all. 
   Only last month, the son of the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. led a march on the Lincoln Memorial to commemorate his father's legacy. His father inspired a nation 37 years ago when he said, in words that echoed throughout the world and have been etched in history, that he had a dream that one day racial justice would flow like a mighty river. Sadly, our Nation has not fulfilled that dream. As Martin Luther King III noted, racial profiling continues to harm Americans and erodes the important trust that should exist between law enforcement and the people they serve and protect. 
   President Clinton has endorsed S. 821, and last June he directed federal law enforcement agencies to begin collecting and reporting data on the race, ethnicity and gender of the people they stop and search at our Nation's borders and airports. A coalition of civil rights and law enforcement organizations--including the ACLU, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives--also support this legislation. I am pleased that 20 Senators have joined to cosponsor the bill, and I am hopeful that if allowed to come to a vote, my amendment would enjoy broad support. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill by voice vote in the 105th Congress, and this March, the House Judiciary Committee passed the bill again. It's time we passed it in the Senate, too. 
   Racial profiling and soft money campaign finance reform are issues that deserve consideration in the Senate. Regrettably, the procedures that the majority leader employed to consider the H-1B bill and too many other bills have so far blocked their consideration. Before this Senate adjourns sine die, I  hope that we will have an opportunity to address these, and many other issues that demand attention. If it fails to, this Senate's mark in history will be no more permanent than a shadow. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is a clear need for Independent Review of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. During debate on this bill I was prepared to offer an amendment on Independent Review. It was drawn from similar provisions in a larger piece of Corps Reform legislation sponsored by my Wisconsin colleague in the other body (Mr. KIND). My interest in an Independent Review amendment was shared by the Minority Leader (Mr. DASCHLE) and the Senator from California (Mrs. BOXER) and a number of taxpayer and environmental organizations. including: the League of Conservation Voters, American Rivers, Coast Alliance, Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Izaak Walton League of America, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and Taxpayers for Common Sense. 
   I believe that the Senate should act right now to require Independent Review in this Water Resources Development Act, but the Senate is apparently not ready to take that step. Nevertheless, in response to my initiative, the bill's managers (Senator SMITH and Senator BAUCUS) have adopted an amendment as part of their Manager's Package which should help get the Authorizing Committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, the additional information it needs to develop and refine legislation on this issue through a one year study by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on peer review. As part of the discussions with the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. SMITH) and the Senator from Montana (Mr. BAUCUS) over the amendment I intended to offer, they have agreed that as the NAS conducts its review, they will hold hearings on the issue of Corps reform and on a bill which I will introduce next Congress that will include Independent Review. I want to make certain that an NAS study does not become an excuse not to do anything on Corps reform for a year. Therefore, I have not opposed that study, and its completion will eliminate one argument against enacting serious Corps reform. The managers understand my concern in this regard, and are interested in moving forward on reforms, and have agreed to my request for hearings. It is my hope that through hearings the NAS study and my bill can dovetail nicely so that we have a fully vetted bill which can then be fined tuned by the NAS recommendations. The agreement we have made provides the best chance to pass a serious reform bill in the next year, rather than reach deadlock. 
   I appreciate the efforts that the Managers of this bill have taken to bring this bill to the floor in the closing days of this Senate. I know that many of these Corps projects are extremely important to many of our constituents. However, Mr. President, in light of the attention and concern that the replacement of the Upper Mississippi locks has had in my own home state, I felt it that it was important that the issue of establishing additional oversight and review of Corps projects be raised in the context of this year's Water Resources bill, and that we begin down the road to passage of Corps reform legislation. Today we are closer to that goal than we were yesterday. 
   As last week's five part series on the Corps of Engineers which ran in the Washington Post last week highlighted, the ongoing construction and maintenance of Corps dams, navigation  channels, and flood control structures, and other water development projects dramatically alter 
   the nation's landscapes. Michael Grunwald's Sunday, September 10, 2000 story made this point very clear that the debate over whether the Corps:  
   ..... should grow or shrink, and how much it should shift its focus from construction projects to restoration project.....may not be the sexiest of Beltway brawls, but it will have a dramatic effect on America. Corps levees and floodwalls protect millions of homes, farms and businesses. Its coastal ports and barge channels carry 2 billion tons of freight annually. Its dams generate one-fourth of America's hydroelectric power. Its water recreation sites attract more visitors than the National Park Service's. Its land holdings would cover Vermont and New Hampshire. But the Corps may have its greatest impact on nature ..... So the future direction of the Corps will help determine the future health of America's environment.  
   Furthermore, this major government program costs federal taxpayers billions of dollars each year, and unfortunately, there have been times when economically unjustified activities have made it through to construction. While there are heartening signs of reform in the Corps Civil Works program, Congress should be working to create an independent process to help affirm when the Corps gets it right and help to provide a means for identifying problems before taxpayer funded construction investments are made. Today we begin that work in earnest. 
   Mr. President, I feel that requiring independent review of large and controversial Corps projects is a practical first step down the road to a reformed Corps of Engineers. Independent review would catch mistakes by Corps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps officials to justify questionable projects, and would provide planners desperately needed support against the never ending pressure of project boosters. Those boosters, Mr. President, include Congressional interests, which is why I believe that this body needs to champion reform--to end the perception that Corps projects are all pork and no substance. As Mike Grunwald's article on Monday, September 11, 2000 states:  
   Water projects are a traditional coin of the realm on Capitol Hill, offering members of Congress jobs, contracts and other benefits for their constituents and campaign contributors --as well as ribbon cutting opportunities for themselves. In fact, the Corps budget consists almost entirely of projects requested by individual lawmakers, then approved by the Corps; the agency has almost no discretionary funds of its own.  
   I wish it were the case, Mr. President, that I could argue that additional oversight were not needed, but unfortunately, I see that there is need for additional scrutiny. In the Upper Mississippi there is troubling evidence of abuse. There is troubling evidence from whistleblowers that senior Corps officials, under pressure from barge interests, ordered their subordinates to exaggerate demand for barges in order to justify new Mississippi River locks. This is a matter which is still under investigation, and I hope that no evidence of wrongdoing will ultimately be found. Adequate assessment of the environmental impacts of barges is also very important. I am also concerned that the Corps' assessment of the environmental impacts of additional barges does not adequately assess the impacts of barge movements on fish, backwaters and aquatic plants. We should not gamble with the environmental health of the river. If we allow more barges 
   on the Mississippi, we must be sure the environmental impacts of those barges are fully mitigated. 
   I am raising this issue principally because I believe that Congress should act to restore trust in the Corps if we are going to complete an unbiased assessment of navigation needs. The first step in restoring that trust is restoring the credibility of the Corps' decision-making process. We must remove the cloud hanging over the Corps. There is a basic conflict of interest here, and Mike Grunwald's story on Wednesday, September 11, 2000, again in the Washington Post, makes this clear:  
   The same agency that evaluates the proposed water projects gets to work on the ones it deems worthwhile. If the analysis concludes that the economic costs of a project outweigh its benefits, or that the ecological damage of a project is too extreme, then the Corps loses a potential job.  
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, Congress now finds itself having to reset the scales to make economic benefits and environmental restoration co-equal goals of project planning. Our rivers serve many masters--barge owners as well as bass fisherman--and the Corps' planning process should reflect the diverse demands we place on them. I want to make sure that future Corps projects no longer fail to produce predicted benefits, stop costing more than the Corps estimated, and do not have unanticipated environmental impacts. In the future, we must monitor the result of projects so that we can learn from our mistakes and, when possible, correct them. We should impose a system of peer review as soon as possible and consider other comprehensive reforms. In a first step toward full evaluation of projects, I have committed myself to making Corps reform a priority in the next year and in the 107th Congress. The agreement we have reached today ensures that this Senate will also make it a priority.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the Senator from Maine in talking about the importance of eliminating the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare payments to home health agencies. It is currently scheduled for October 1, 2001. I am very pleased to be working with her on this because she is a tremendous leader on this issue. It is a very good example of the kind of bipartisanship that is essential for this body to function well. I am most pleased to be working with the Senator on this because it is so obvious she has taken a great deal of time to listen to her constituents about this very important issue. 
   I have heard the same sad story in Wisconsin, and we hear a lot of very compelling human stories in this job. But I find this one impossible to ignore. I know the Senator from Maine feels the same way. The fact is, this system of home health care--at least in the State of the Senator from Maine and my State--was working. It is not as if it is something we are trying to create. It was working. Because of some poorly constructed policies, it is being harmed in a way that is truly harming older people in our country. 
   The story the Senator from Maine gave is a very compelling example of a broader series of tragedies that are occurring, I think, on an almost daily basis in my State of Wisconsin, and in many other States. 
   So, I thank her. I believe strongly that Congress must act to preserve access to home health care for seniors and others. That is why I have made the preservation of access to home health services one of my top priorities in the U.S. Senate. 
   For seniors who are homebound and have skilled nursing needs, having access to home health services through the Medicare Program is the difference between staying in their own home and moving into a nursing home. 
   The availability of home health services is integral to preserving independence, dignity, and hope for many beneficiaries. I feel strongly that where there is a choice, we should do our best to allow patients to choose home health care. I think seniors need and deserve that choice. 
   Mr. President, as you know, and as many of our colleagues know, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained significant changes to the way that Medicare pays for home health services. Perhaps the most significant change was a switch from cost-based reimbursement to an interim payment system, or IPS. 
   IPS was intended as a cost-saving transitional payment system to tide us over until the development and implementation of a prospective payment system or PPS, for home health payments under Medicare. Unfortunately, the cuts went deeper than anyone--including CBO forecasters--anticipated, leaving many Medicare beneficiaries without access to the services they need. 
   These unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have been severe indeed. Instead of the $100 billion in 5-year savings that we targeted, present projections indicate that actual Medicare reductions have been in the area of $200 billion. 
   Home health care spending, which the Congressional Budget Office expected to rise by $2 billion in the last 2 years even after factoring in the Balanced Budget Act cuts, has instead fallen by nearly $8 billion, or 45 percent. 
   These painful cuts have forced more than 40 home health care agencies in 22 Wisconsin counties to close their doors, in just 2 years. 
   So, what do these changes mean for Medicare beneficiaries? 
   Frankly, in many parts of Wisconsin, these changes mean that beneficiaries in certain areas or with certain diagnoses simply do not have access to home health care. 
   I am concerned that a further 15-percent cut in home health care reimbursements will further jeopardize care and leave some of our frailest Medicare beneficiaries without the choice to receive care at home. Last year, I was proud to work with Senator COLLINS and others to delay the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare home health payments for one year. However, I believe this reduction must be eliminated in order to preserve access to home health care. 
   I think seniors need and deserve the choice to stay in their homes, and I hope my colleagues will follow the leadership of Senator COLLINS and others by supporting the elimination of the 15-percent cut. 
   Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my deep concern about a provision that is tucked into the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill. It came to light in a front page story last Thursday in the Washington Post. We have become accustomed in this body to hearing about outrageous special interest provisions finding their way into must-pass appropriations bills, but this one is really special. Section 305 of the bill that was reported by the Appropriations Committee exempts Federal judges from the ban on receiving cash honoraria contained in the Ethics in Government Act. 
   If this provision becomes law, Federal judges will once again be able to accept cash compensation for speeches. There will be no limit on this additional compensation because the bill also provides that honoraria will not be considered outside income, which is subject under current law to a cap equal to 15 percent of the salary of a Level II executive employee, or about $22,000. With this change, Federal judges will be able to supplement their Federal salaries of over $140,000 per year with tens of thousands of dollars from speaking engagements. 
   The Federal judiciary as a whole is widely respected, and deservedly so. But it has been a bad few months for the reputation of the judiciary. Even before this effort to lift the honoraria ban, there has been increasing attention to the practice of Federal judges traveling to posh resorts and dude ranches to attend seminars and conferences. These junkets are ``all-expenses paid,'' and the bill is often footed by legal foundations and industry groups with litigation interests before the very judges who attend the seminars. 
   A recent report released by Community Rights Council found that at least 1,030 Federal judges took over 5,800 privately funded trips between 1992 and 1998. Some of these seminars are conducted at posh vacation resorts in locations such as Amelia Island, FL and Hilton Head, SC, and include ample time for expense-paid recreation. These kinds of education/vacation trips, which have been valued at over $7,000 in some cases, create an appearance that the judges who attend are profiting from their positions. More important, they create an appearance that is not consistent with the image of an impartial judiciary. 
   That is the same image that is threatened by this proposed repeal of the honoraria ban. Who 
   in this body believes that the powerful interests that seek our good will through campaign contributions would not try to curry favor with judges with generous honoraria? Have we learned nothing over the past two decades? In 1989, the Congress took a big step forward by increasing the salaries of federal employees and prohibiting honoraria. Perhaps we need to revisit the issue of the salaries of federal judges in light of current economic circumstances. But one thing I am absolutely certain we should not  do is relax the ethical standards to which they are subject. The independence and impartiality of the judiciary are too important to our system of justice. This would truly be a case of cutting off our nose to spite our face. 
   Now let me say a few words about the process by which this significant change in the ethical guidelines that apply to judges has come close to becoming law. The provision was included in the bill reported by the Appropriations Committee on July 18. It was very quietly added to that bill. It takes up only a page and a half of 126 pages of legislative language. And the committee report, which usually can be counted on to explain the bill says the following about section 305:  
   *.*.* section 305 amends section 501 of 5 U.S.C. App.  
   That is it. No explanation, no rationale, no argument for why this change should be made, or why it is being done in an appropriations bill instead of in substantive legislation that might be the subject--which you might imagine we would like to have--of hearing and committee consideration. 
   At any rate, the Commerce State Justice appropriations bill still has not yet come to the floor and now it appears very likely it will never come to the floor. That means that those of us who oppose the lifting of the honoraria ban, not to mention other troubling provisions in that bill, will never have a chance to offer an amendment to delete it from the bill. We will never have a chance to ask our colleagues to vote on this provision. We will never know whether the United States Senate supports what the Appropriations Committee has done. 
   I think that is outrageous. We should be ashamed. This is a very important revision to the Ethics in Government Act. The Senate should be permitted to vote on it. But the Republican leadership will not let that happen. That means that the crucial decision will be made by the appropriators in their mock conference, and by the negotiators of a final omnibus spending bill. 
   It appears that lifting the honoraria ban for judges in some of our colleagues' minds is just a first step to allowing other public officials to supplement their salaries with payments from special interests. The majority leader was quoted as saying that we'll probably need to get rid of the ban for Members of Congress as well. I urge the people who are crafting these bills to think twice before starting down this slippery slope. Let's keep the honoraria ban in place for judges and ensure that our judiciary maintains its integrity and the respect of the American people.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the tragic events that occurred over the weekend in the West African country of Guinea. West Africa is a very rough neighborhood, and for years Guinea has borne a heavy refugee burden, as Liberian and Sierra Leonean people have fled into its borders to escape violence in their home countries. In fact, Guinea hosts more refugees than any other country in Africa--nearly half a million of them. 
   The region's tensions have, unfortunately, spilled over to affect the welfare of refugees. Recently, a crisis erupted when a series of armed incursions into Guinea from Liberia and Sierra Leone provoked a violent reaction on the part of Guinean authorities who rounded up and arrested thousands of foreigners, including refugees, accusing them of aiding the attackers. 
   On Sunday, in the town of Macenta, Mensah Kpognon, a Togolese employee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was killed, and another UNHCR worker from the Ivory Coast, Sapeu Laurence Djeya, was abducted by unidentified attackers. Reports indicate that dozens of civilians were also killed in the raid. 
   This terrible tragedy marks the fourth murder of a UNHCR worker in less than two weeks. Three others, including an American citizen, Carlos Caceres, were murdered on September 6, 2000 in Atambua, West Timor by a militia mob while Indonesian armed forces and police failed to stop the violence. 
   These terrible crimes, committed against individuals who dedicated their lives to helping others in need, must not continue. All responsible members of the international community must work together to provide security for the humanitarian workers laboring in difficult conditions around the globe. Governments in the region must ensure that those responsible for these acts must be held accountable for their actions. Cross-border raids into Guinea must be stopped. And most urgently, the governments of West Africa must work to find Sapeu Laurence Djeya and to ensure her safety and freedom.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would put an end to automatic cost-of-living adjustments for Congressional pay. 
   As my Colleagues are aware, it is an unusual thing to have the power to raise our own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our constituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual is good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to exercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, amendment, and a vote on the RECORD. 
   Earlier today, the Senate voted down the conference report on the Legislative Branch appropriations bill. As I noted during the debate on that bill, by considering the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill as part of that conference report, shielded as it was from amendment, the Senate blocked any opportunity to force an open debate of a $3,800 pay raise next year for every Member of the Senate and the House of Representatives. This process of pay raises without accountability must end. 
   The stealth pay raise technique being employed this year began with a change Congress enacted in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section 704 of that Act, Members of Congress voted to make themselves entitled to an annual raise equal to half a percentage point less than the employment cost index, one measure of inflation. Many times, Congress has voted to deny itself the raise, and Congress traditionally does that on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. 
   And by bringing the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill to the Senate floor for the first time this week in a conference report, without Senate floor consideration, the majority leadership prevented anyone from offering an amendment on that bill to block the pay raise. The majority leadership tried to make it impossible even to put Senators on record in an up-or-down vote directly for or against the pay raise. The majority nearly perfected the technique of the stealth pay raise. 
   And the majority also made it impossible to link this Congressional pay raise directly to other pay issues of importance to the American people. The majority made it impossible to consider, among other things, an amendment that would have delayed the Congressional pay raise until working Americans get a much-needed raise in the minimum wage. 
   The majority leadership thus appears to believe that cost-of-living adjustments make sense for Senators and Congressmen, but that cost-of-living adjustments do not make sense for working people making the minimum wage. 
   The process that gives Senators and Congressmen an automatic cost-of-living adjustment makes it easier for the majority leadership to block the Senate from rectifying this injustice. If the Senate had to debate and vote on a bill to raise its pay, a Senator could offer an amendment that would point out inequities like this. 
   The question of how and whether Members of Congress can raise their own pay was one that our Founders considered from the beginning of our Nation. In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that included what has become our Bill of Rights, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Constitution providing that Congress could not raise its pay without an intervening election. Almost exactly 211 years ago, on September 9, 1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September of 1789, Congress submitted the amendments to the states. 
   Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in the 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the Wisconsin state Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its approval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed approval by three-fourths of the states. 
   The 27th Amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.'' 
   I try to honor that limitation in my own practices. In my own case, throughout my 6-year term, I accept only the rate of pay that Senators receive on the date on which I was sworn in as a Senator. And I return to the Treasury any additional income Senators get, whether from a cost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise we vote for ourselves. I don't take a raise until my boss, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at the ballot box. That is the spirit of the 27th Amendment. 
   Now, this year's procedural device allowing another pay raise to go into effect without a recorded vote does not violate the letter of the Constitution. But stealth pay raises like the one that the Senate allowed this year certainly violate the spirit of that amendment. 
   Mr. President, this practice must end. To address it, I am introducing this bill to end the automatic cost-of-living adjustment for Congressional pay. Senators and Congressmen should have to vote up-or-down to raise Congressional pay.  
   The majority has sought to prevent votes on pay raises. My bill would simply require us to vote in the open. We owe our constituents no less. 
   I urge my Colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the RECORD.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this conference report on the legislative branch appropriations bill. The reasons for my opposition have much to do with the process by which this conference report has come to us. As I said in my statement this May during debate on the motion to proceed to the foreign operations appropriations bill, the character of the Senate has been changing. This conference report is yet another example of that change. And the change has not been for the better. 
   The Senate sent to conference a $2 1/2 billion legislative branch appropriations bill. The House majority leadership took that conference on a relatively modest bill and shoveled into it a $55 billion tax cut and a $30 billion appropriations bill for the Treasury Department, the Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies. This is an abuse of the powers of the majority. 
   Mr. President, the Senate may be calloused to the accelerating number of abuses that we have witnessed in the past few years. And this growing indifference may have given some comfort to those who are spearheading this particular offensive. 
   But, Mr. President, there is a facet to this latest effort that makes it especially worthy of opposition. For adopting this conference report, now shielded from amendment, removes the opportunity to force an open debate of a $3,800 pay raise for every Member of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 
   By bringing the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill to the Senate floor for the first time in this conference report, without Senate floor consideration, the majority prevents anyone from offering an amendment on that bill to block the pay raise. The majority makes it impossible even to put Senators on record in an up-or-down vote directly for or against the pay raise. The majority has thus perfected the technique of the stealth pay raise. 
   And the majority also makes it impossible to link this congressional pay raise directly to other pay issues of importance to the American people. With this abuse of the rules, the majority makes it impossible to consider, among other things, an amendment that would delay the congressional pay raise until working Americans get a much-needed raise in the minimum wage. 
   The majority leadership thus appears to believe that cost-of-living adjustments make sense for Senators and Congressmen, but that cost-of-living adjustments do not make sense for working people making the minimum wage. 
   The abuse of the process that brings us here today prevents the Senate from rectifying this injustice. If the Senate were considering the regular Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, a Senator could offer an amendment that would point out inequities like this. And that, in the end, might help explain why the majority is using this procedure today. That might explain why we are not considering the regular Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, but are considering an unamenable conference report. 
   This unamendable conference report culminates the technique of the stealth pay raise. As my colleagues are aware, it is an unusual thing to have the power to raise our own pay. Few people have that ability. Most of our constituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual is good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to exercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate and amendment. 
   The question of how and whether Members of Congress can raise their own pay was one that our Founders considered from the beginning of our Nation. In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that included what has become our Bill of Rights, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Constitution providing that Congress could not raise its pay without an intervening election. Almost exactly 211 years ago, on September 9, 1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September of 1789, Congress submitted the amendments to the states. 
   Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in the 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its approval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed approval by three-fourths of the states. 
   The 27th amendment to the constitution now states: ``No law, varying the compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, shall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have intervened.'' Now, today's action does not violate the letter of the Constitution, because it is the result of a 1989 law that provides for a regular cost-of-living adjustment for congressional pay. But stealth pay raises like the one that the Senate allows today certainly violate the spirit of that amendment. 
   Mr. President, this practice must end. To address it, I intend to introduce legislation that ends the automatic cost-of-living adjustment for congressional pay. 
   The conference report before us today took its final shape just before the August recess, during what were reported to be all-night, closed-door meetings. The House majority leadership then tried to muscle this conference report through the House on the day before the recess. The bill survived a procedural vote by just four votes, 214 to 210. with Representatives anxious to begin their August recess, the House leadership decided to postpone further action until this month. 
   The conference report before us today includes the Treasury Postal bill. The Senate never had a chance to consider the Treasury Postal bill that is now part of this conference report. The Senate Appropriations Committee ordered the bill reported on July 20. It is available for Senate consideration as a separate bill. 
   This conference report on an appropriations bill also includes a repeal of the telephone excise tax. Now repealing the telephone tax is probably the best tax cut idea that we will get in this Congress. I voted to repeal the telephone tax during consideration of the estate tax bill. 
   But that was a tax bill. Today, we are being asked to enact that tax cut on an appropriations bill. A tax cut that will cost $55 billion over the next decade should not be added in the middle of the night in a conference on a $2 1/2 billion appropriations bill. 
   As well, the conference report also makes budget process law changes. Section 1002 of the conference report changes the limits on outlays set in the current budget resolution for defense and non-defense spending. It shifts $2 billion from non-defense spending to defense spending. Making this budget process change violates the rules. Section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act prohibits including budget process changes like this in a bill that is not a budget process bill. 
   Some may argue that if we do not enact this conference report with this abuse of the process, then the leadership will confront us with an even greater abuse of process in the form of an even larger omnibus appropriations bill. Even were that so, my colleagues, we here cannot and must not give the leadership a blank check to include any matter that they choose. And we most certainly can demand that Congress do what we can to ensure that we get no pay raise until such time as Congress has enacted a raise in the minimum wage. 
   This is a matter of principle, because this conference report does not honor the principles of debate and amendment that undergird the rules of this Senate. 
   And this is a matter of fairness, because this conference report allows a $3,800 pay raise for Senators and Congressmen, before the Congress has enacted a $1,000 pay raise for working Americans making the minimum wage. 
   The majority has sought to prevent votes on this pay raise. By preventing  votes on amendments, they have made this final vote on this conference report the single vote that will allow the congressional pay raise to happen. A Member who wants to prevent a congressional pay raise before we have a raise in the minimum wage has this one opportunity to vote against it. 
   It is for these reasons that I will vote against this conference report.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in recent days, Congress has held hearings and considered legislation on the terrible tragedy involving potentially defective tires manufactured by Bridgestone/Firestone and placed on certain vehicles sold by the Ford Motor Company. It has captured the nation's and the media's attention. And rightly so. I hope we are able to get to the bottom of who knew what, when, why and how. 
   But while Congress demands accountability from these companies, as well as the Transportation Department, Congress should also demand accountability from the Justice Department. As the Senate Commerce Committee held hearings on the Firestone tire problem the other day, a few blocks down the road the Justice Department released a report that seriously calls into question the fairness of the federal death penalty system. The report documents apparent racial and geographic disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty. In other words, who lives and who dies, and who is charged, tried, convicted and sentenced to death in the federal system appears to relate arbitrarily to the color of one's skin or where one lives. The report can be read as a chilling indictment of our federal criminal justice system. 
   I introduced legislation earlier this year calling for a national moratorium on executions and the creation of a commission to review the fairness of the administration of the death penalty at the state and federal levels. It is much-needed legislation that will begin to address the growing concerns of the American people with the fairness and accuracy of our nation's death penalty system. I am pleased that that bill, the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act, has the support of some of my colleagues, including Senators LEVIN, WELLSTONE, DURBIN, and BOXER. 
   But now, with the first federal execution in almost 40 years scheduled to take place in December, I urge my colleagues to take action in the remaining weeks of this session to restore justice and fairness to our federal criminal justice system. I rise today to introduce the Federal Death Penalty Moratorium Act. Like my earlier bill, this bill would suspend executions of federal death row inmates while an independent, blue ribbon commission thoroughly reviews the flaws in the federal death penalty system. The first federal execution in almost 40 years is scheduled to take place after this Congress has adjourned. But before we adjourn, we have an obligation--indeed, a solemn responsibility--to the American people to ensure that the federal criminal justice system is a fair one, particularly when it involves the ultimate punishment, death. 
   Mr. President, some have argued that the flaws in the administration of the death penalty at the state level do not exist at the federal level. But now, with the release of the Justice Department report earlier this week, our suspicions have been heightened. We now know that the federal death penalty system has attributes of inequity and unfairness. 
   The Justice Department report makes a number of troubling findings:  
   Roughly 80 percent of defendants who were charged with death-eligible offenses under Federal law and whose cases were submitted by U.S. Attorneys under the Department's death penalty decision-making procedures were African American, Hispanic American or members of other minority groups; 
   United States attorneys in 5 of the 94 federal districts--1 each in Virginia, Maryland, Puerto Rico and 2 in New York--submit 40 percent of all cases in which the death penalty is considered; 
   United States attorneys who have frequently recommended seeking the death penalty are often from states with a high number of executions, including Texas, Virginia and Missouri; and 
   White defendants are more likely than black defendants to negotiate plea bargains, saving them from the death penalty in federal cases.  
   What do these findings tell us? I think we can all agree that the report is deeply disturbing. There is a glaring lack of uniformity in the application of the federal death penalty. Whether you live or die appears to relate arbitrarily to the color of your skin or where you live. Why do these disparities exist? How can they be addressed? The Justice Department report doesn't have answers to these and other questions. I am pleased that the Attorney General has requested additional internal reviews. But with all respect to the Attorney General, that's simply not enough. The American people deserve more. Indeed, American ideals of justice demand much more. 
   With the first federal execution since the Kennedy Administration only three months away, Congress should call for an independent review. Mr. President, if the Attorney General and the President won't act, then it is our solemn responsibility, as members of Congress, to protect the American people and ensure fairness and justice for all Americans. Congress should demand an answer to the troubling questions raised by the Justice Department report. And I believe we have a duty do so. After all, it was Congress that, beginning in 1988, enacted the laws providing for the death penalty for 
   certain federal crimes. 
   And I might add, the Justice Department has had more than enough time to right the wrong. As some of my colleagues may recall, concerns about racial disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty were hotly debated in 1994 during debate on the Racial Justice Act as the Congress decided whether to expand the federal death penalty. At that time, a House Judiciary Subcommittee report found that 89 percent of defendants against whom the federal government sought the death penalty under the 1988 Drug Kingpin Statute were African American or Hispanic Americans. In response to these concerns, the Attorney General centralized the process for U.S. attorneys requesting the Attorney General's authorization to seek the death penalty. 
   The Attorney General's centralized review process has now been in operation for nearly 6 years. But we have not seen anything approaching rough consistency, let alone uniformity in the federal death penalty system. We are continuing to see egregious disparities. One of the greatest needs for additional data and analysis involves the  question of how line prosecutors and U.S. attorneys are making decisions to take cases at the federal level and charge defendants with death-eligible offenses. But Congress and the American people should not wait for another report that fails to ask and answer this and other tough questions. Indeed, an agency that tries to review itself can't always be expected to be fully forthcoming or fully equipped to identify its own failings. That's why an independent, blue ribbon commission is the only appropriate response to the Justice Department report. 
   And time is of the essence. It's not too late for Congress to act. We should demand full accountability. In fact, the American people are demanding accountability and fairness. In a poll released today by The Justice Project, 64 percent of registered voters support a suspension of executions while fairness questions are addressed, based on information that in several instances, criminals sentenced to be executed have been released based on new evidence or DNA testing. And this is not just a partisan issue, or shouldn't be. The poll, conducted by Democratic and Republican polling firms, found that 73 percent of Independents and 50 percent of Republicans, including 65 percent of non-conservative Republicans, support a suspension of executions. The American people get it. Something is terribly amiss in our administration of the ultimate punishment, death. And this is just as true at the federal level. 
   So, as we approach the close of this 106th Congress, I urge my colleagues to support a moratorium on federal executions while we study the glaring flaws in the federal death penalty system through an independent, blue ribbon commission. It is disturbing enough that the ultimate punishment may be meted out unfairly at the state level. But it should be even more troubling for my colleagues when the federal government, which should be leading the states on matters of equality, justice and fairness, has a system that is unjust. We are at a defining moment in the history of our nation's administration of the death penalty. The time to do something is now.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment will increase the strength and the relevance of the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China. 
   It is no secret that I oppose H.R. 4444, the bill extending permanent normal trade relations to China. I believe it is a mistake to institutionalize a separation between our trading relationship with China and our concerns regarding the deteriorating human rights situation in China. I believe this compartmentalization of American interests makes for policy that is confused, contradictory, and ultimately ineffective. 
   I am not blind to the numbers; I am not blind to the likely votes. This bill stands an excellent chance of passing the Senate, and we are dealing with legislation likely to become law. So I choose to take seriously the efforts made in the other body to somehow integrate human rights concerns into this legislation. 
   Perhaps I am supposed to assume those efforts are simply window dressing, mere political cover for those who feel obligated to address human rights issues but who are also disinclined to impede this trade initiative with inconvenient complications. But I reject that assumption. If this bill passes, as it probably will, the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China will be important both in substance and as a symbol. It may well be the only remaining bridge in our China policy between this country's highest values and the pursuit of profit for the few. It will be the watchdog, in a sense, responsible for ensuring that our trade policy undermines neither our national values nor our national character. Its structure and its mandate will carry this burden. So I do think this commission deserves our serious consideration. 
   As currently constructed, the commission would produce an annual report. But it would not be required to include policy recommendations in this report, and neither the House nor the Senate would actually be required to debate the report or to hold any kind of vote on it. In short, the commission would be extremely weak and then, of course, could be easily be marginalized. 
   My amendment would strengthen the commission in several ways. First, it would require that the commission's report contain recommendations for legislative and/or executive action,  rather than simply permitting such recommendations. As the debate on this bill has shown, we do not lack for reports of gross human rights violations in China. But simply stating the facts is not enough; our actions must reflect acknowledgement of those facts. Thick reports and handwringing in and of themselves do not serve U.S. interests. Policy recommendations have to be an explicit part of the commission's mandate. 
   In addition, this amendment would require that legislative proposals contained in the report be considered by both the House International Relations Committee and by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As it now stands, this commission reports only to the House. I urge my colleagues in this body, the Senate, to recognize that the Senate needs to consider this report and its recommendations as well. We cannot leave this important work solely to our House colleagues and, in effect, wash our hands of it. We must protect the Senate's prerogatives and ensure that both Chambers of this Congress engage with this important commission. 
   Finally, this amendment lays out a procedure by which this 
   commission's recommendations could be considered by this body rather than simply gathering dust and assuaging consciences on our office shelves. It would establish a procedure, one that is not unfamiliar or unprecedented, whereby commission recommendations, in the form of a resolution, would be considered by the appropriate committees. These committees would then hold hearings to review these recommendations, allowing for public comment and opening up this process to democratic participation and actual debate. 
   Critically, after committee consideration, any Member of the House or Senate would have the right to call up the resolution on the floor. This amendment ensures that the crucially important issues covered by the commission can be considered by any Member, not only the members of certain committees. As it now stands, only members of the House International Relations Committee would have the power to consider and weigh the commission report. That seems very odd to me for a bicameral legislature. This amendment provides a mechanism for moving the substance of commission recommendations onto the floor and into the realm of full congressional consideration. 
   This is hardly an extreme proposition. My amendment would give this commission greater relevance, rather than relegating it to bureaucratic limbo. Relevance seems like an eminently reasonable goal for a body charged with the critically important work of reconciling U.S. support for human rights with the U.S. trade policy toward China. 
   Those toiling in forced labor camps are relevant. This body ought to behave as if they are relevant. The Tibetan and Chinese people, fighting every day for religious freedom, are relevant. Victims of torture are relevant. The Congressional Executive-Commission on the People's Republic of China is where these people will now have to find their place in U.S. policy. I urge my colleagues to take this seriously and give it the strength it needs to be meaningful. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to the comments of the distinguished chairman. 
   Yes, this amendment, in terms of the commission that was established in the House consideration of the bill, says there ought to be some recommendations coming out of this commission, there ought to be some reality. This is all we will have left of the opportunity to consider issues such as human rights in connection with China's trade status. 
   Instead of just having a series of documents or volumes on a shelf gathering dust, we suggest there ought to at least be a requirement that there be recommendations coming forward. That seems to me to be very modest. This is not something that would in any way undercut the legislation or the purpose of the legislation. It would simply make sure that the work of the commission results in some recommendation. 
   What strikes me as even more strange about opposition to this amendment is that the distinguished chairman would leave this commission to be only a commission that reports to the House of Representatives. He would prefer that a commission that apparently is a serious commission, one that the chairman will support, as  he votes for final passage of the bill, should not report to this body. I would think his institutional concerns of having to do with proper referral to one committee or another in a revenue bill would also apply to the notion that a report should go to the Senate as well as to the House on something as significant and weighty as the question of human rights and other issues in connection with China's trade status. I find it baffling that the main proponent of this bill would not agree that this Senate should receive the report, as well as the House. 
   The Senator makes the point, as well he should as chairman of the Finance Committee, that he believes there may be some concerns about proper jurisdiction in terms of committees. I am a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, so I definitely believe this should go to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   But I have no problem with certainly inviting an amendment that calls for a joint reporting to both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. It seems to me that would take care of that concern. I know of a number of cases in my brief time in the Senate where we have had these joint referrals, and that would take care of the chairman's concern. 
   Not only is this amendment not threatening to the underlying purpose of this legislation, it is simply an amendment that balances the purpose of this commission so that it has some relationship to the structure of our Congress. It says there ought to be recommendations given and they should be reported to the Senate as well as to the House; that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should continue to consider these recommendations, as it has done in the past. 
   I can't think of a more modest amendment one could raise with regard to this bill. It is based on a commission that was already approved overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives and supported by all of those who support this legislation. All we are trying to do is have a similar requirement with respect to a report in the Senate. It couldn't be more modest. It is a sign of how desperate the proponents of this legislation are to get this thing through without even the possibility of a modest, logical change such as having the Senate as well as the House receive a report. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time if the opposition to the amendment will do the same?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment is eminently reasonable. This body is considering a bill that is very likely to become law. We have a responsibility to take that bill seriously, to actually examine its contents. 
   All my amendment will do is, first, require the Congressional-Executive Commission to make recommendations in its report. Secondly, we would require the commission to report to the Senate as well as to the House. Currently, under the bill, the commission reports only to the House International Relations Committee. And third, it will create a mechanism whereby any Member of the Senate can call the commission recommendations up on the floor so that these issues are not the exclusive purview of certain committees. 
   The amendment will not require the commission to affirmatively approve extension of PNTR. It will not infringe on any Member's right to amend legislation on the floor. 
   I think it is difficult to argue that this amendment does not improve the commission and the bill. I urge my colleagues to take this process seriously. I urge them to support this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Smith amendment to H.R. 4444, the bill to extend permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic of China. The Smith amendment would have extended the mandate of the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China to include responsibility for monitoring and reporting on organ harvesting in China. For years, chilling reports have emerged out of China, detailing horrific scenarios in which organs are illicitly harvested for profit from executed prisoners. It is my understanding that the Chinese government has failed to take action to stop the criminal elements responsible for these abhorrent practices. Certainly careful monitoring and reporting on this issue is appropriate.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in recent months, our Nation has begun to question the fairness of the death penalty with greater urgency. Now, with details of the Justice Department report being released, we have learned that just as we feared, the same serious flaws in the administration of the death penalty that have plagued the states also afflict the federal death penalty. The report documents apparent racial and regional disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty. All Americans agree that whether you die for committing a federal crime should not depend arbitrarily on the color of your skin or randomly on where you live. When 5 of our 93 United States Attorneys account for 40 percent of the cases where the death penalty is sought; when 75 percent of federal death penalty cases involve a minority defendant, something may be awry and it's time to stop and take a sober look at the system that imposes the ultimate punishment in our names. 
   I first urged the President to suspend federal executions to allow time for a thorough review of the death penalty on February 2 of this year. I repeat that request today, more strongly than ever. While I understand the Attorney General plans further studies of some of the issues raised by the report, additional internal reviews alone will not satisfy public concern about our system. With the solemn responsibility that our government has to the American people to ensure the utmost fairness and justice in the administration of the ultimate punishment, and with the first federal execution since 1963 scheduled to take place before the end of the year, a credible, comprehensive review can be conducted only by an independent commission. 
   This is what Governor Ryan decided in Illinois. He created an independent, blue ribbon commission to review the criminal justice system in his state, while suspending executions. The wisdom of that bold stroke by Governor Ryan is clear, both to supporters and opponents of capital punishment. The federal government must do the same. The President should appoint a blue ribbon federal commission of prosecutors, judges, law enforcement officials, and other distinguished Americans to address the questions that are raised by the Justice Department report and propose solutions that will ensure fairness in the administration of the federal death penalty. 
   I urge the President to suspend all federal executions while an independent commission undertakes a thorough review. That is the right thing to do, given the troubling racial and regional disparities in the administration of the federal death penalty. Indeed, it is the only fair and rational response to these disturbing questions. Let's take the time to be sure we are being fair. Let's temporarily suspend federal executions and let a thoughtfully chosen commission examine the system. American ideals of justice demand that much.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today, Mr. President, to express my opposition to granting permanent normal trade relations to the People's Republic of China. 
   The recent history of U.S.-China relations has been a study in self-delusion. The administration and this Congress do not lack for evidence or information about the nature of the Chinese government. But I am afraid the siren song of vast Chinese markets has deafened too many ears to the news of oppression and abuse inside China. Too often, the U.S. has chosen to ignore the realities before us and, as in this trade debate, has engaged in political and intellectual contortions to compartmentalize and seal off a host of important issues so that the promise of vast profits can stand alone and unencumbered. 
   But I urge my colleagues to remember today--the mythological sirens' song served to lure sailors onto the rocks that crushed their ships. And refusing to look at the whole picture of U.S.-China relations in the single-minded pursuit of trade is, I submit, both foolish and dangerous. I fear that this country will find its policy in shambles unless we force ourselves to see the facts before us. 
   The fact is that China continues to be one of the most oppressive states in the world. 
   The State Department acknowledges that the human rights situation in China has deteriorated over the past year--a year in which the U.S. has extended normal trade relations with China, casting doubt on the claims that trade will lead to greater openness and therefore greater civil and political rights in China. 
   The list of abuses committed by the Chinese government is so lengthy, so encompassing, as to be numbing. Thousands of political prisoners remain in prison--many sentenced after unfair trials or no trial at all. Torture is regularly used to extract ``confessions'' from detainees. Authorities continue to use the brutal laogai system of ``reeducation through labor'' to detain dissidents and others deemed dangerous to this paranoid state. Religious freedom does not exist in China; from global faiths like Catholicism to more obscure sects, the leadership in Beijing has sought to force its will and its agenda on spirituality. Nowhere is this more egregious than in Tibet, where thousands of monks and nuns still are arbitrarily detained, where something termed ``patriotic education'' is forced on Tibetans at their monasteries, where individuals have been arrested and sentenced to imprisonment for activities such as displaying the banned  Tibetan flag, where an entire culture is at risk. And forced abortion and forced sterilization are realities in the PRC. 
   The Chinese government has waged a campaign to destroy all sources of dissent. Leading members of the China Democracy Party have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms for ``conspiring to subvert state power.'' Activists in Xinjiang have been the target of a campaign of arrests, substandard trials, and executions. Leaders of laborers and peasants daring to call for worker's rights are detained. Expression, in virtually all of its forms, is restricted. The government of China has zealously launched into a campaign to monitor and control content on the internet. According to Human Rights Watch, ``last fall, local newspapers and magazines were put under Communist Party control. And the State Press and Publications Administration banned foreign investment in wholesale book publication and distribution, and limited the right to distribute textbooks, political documents, and the writing of China's leaders to a handful of enterprises.'' 
   My colleagues, this is the state that seems so promising to the supporters of PNTR. This is the China with which we are urged to engage. This is to be our 
   full partner. 
   That very abbreviated list of abuses sounds awfully bad, doesn't it? But the Administration's material on PNTR sounds so good. It is full of promises and optimism. How, I wonder, do they imagine getting from here to there--to that promised land in which our relationship with China is all about good news and profits? 
   I would suggest that the influence of money in politics goes a long way toward explaining the peculiar nature of this debate and U.S. policy toward China more broadly. 
   The push for PNTR legislation is one of the most expensive lobbying campaigns in history. Business interests are pitted against labor unions, as they make PAC and soft money contributions, and wage huge lobbying campaigns on television and in the halls of Congress. So before we go any further with this legislation, I would like to Call the Bankroll on the PNTR issue, to give my colleagues and the public an idea of the spending spree that has gone on to lobby us on this bill. 
   Labor unions have donated heavily to the parties as they have fought against Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China. The Center for Responsive Politics estimates labor's overall soft money, PAC and individual contributions at roughly $31 million so far in this election cycle in a May 24th report. In particular, the AFL-CIO and its affiliates, which have campaigned hard against PNTR, have given $60,000 in soft money through the first 15 months of this election cycle. 
   And then there's the other side of the debate. On the side of PNTR we find corporate America, which, according to a New York Times report, engaged in its ``costliest legislative campaign ever'' to win this fight--including an $8 million advertising campaign. The ``costliest legislative campaign ever'' by corporate America--now that's saying something. 
   As we know, corporations typically spend the most in the political money game, and often win as a result. And it looks like PNTR will be no exception, Mr. President. 
   For example, take the Business Roundtable, a well-known business coalition eager to get this bill passed. The Center for Responsive Politics' May 24th report put the collective contributions of Business Roundtable members at $58 million in soft money, PAC money and individual contributions so far in the election cycle. And that is in addition to the Roundtable's $10 million dollar advertising campaign to push PNTR, according to the Center. 
   Business Roundtable members are corporations like Boeing, Philip Morris, UPS and Citigroup. These are heavy hitters who regularly write checks to the political parties for $50,000, $100,000, even a quarter million dollars. These companies have to ante up to stay in the game, Mr. President--PNTR is a high stakes game, and the ante is bigger than ever. 
   I will quickly run down the soft money contributions of these companies, Mr. President. These are huge numbers, and they are just through the first 15 months of this election cycle: Boeing has given more than $465,000 in soft money through the first 15 months of the election cycle, including 10 contributions of $25,000 or more. 
   UPS, its subsidiaries and executives have given more than $960,000 in soft money through March 31st of the current cycle. That includes two contributions of a quarter million dollars. 
   Citigroup, its subsidiaries and executives gave 
   more than one million dollars in soft money through the first 15 months of this election cycle, including six contributions of $50,000 or more. 
   And of course who could forget Philip Morris, Mr. President? Long known as the granddaddy of political donors, Philip Morris and its subsidiaries have given more than $1.2 million in soft money through March 31st of the election cycle, including more than eight donations of $100,000 or more. 
   Since I've mentioned Philip Morris' contributions here, let me take a moment to discuss the impact of contributions of large multinational corporations with many legislative interests. Some might argue that is unfair to mention Philip Morris in this calling of the bankroll because its main interest is tobacco legislation. 
   That is exactly the beauty of soft money contributions from the point of view of the corporate donor. They buy access for the company that makes them. They aren't payment for a particular piece of legislation. No, they are more powerful than that because they are so large, and so sought after by the parties. They further the interests of that company on all pieces of legislation. There can be no doubt that Philip Morris has an interest in PNTR. 
   China is a huge untapped market for cigarettes. So Philip Morris's soft money contributions open the doors for its lobbyists on this issue, just as they open the doors for its anti-tobacco control arguments. 
   Everyone knows that PNTR is the very top legislative priority for the business community in this country. There is absolutely no dispute about that. The lobbying effort has been extraordinary. And Philip Morris's legislative and lobbying muscle, supported by their huge campaign contributions, have been put at the service of that priority, as well as of its own particular interest in tobacco legislation. 
   Mr. President, corporations such as Philip Morris, and the other members of the Business Roundtable pay to play--they get visibility in the debate, and they get their voices heard loud and clear. The shape of the PNTR debate so far is exactly what we should expect from a campaign finance system that is rigged to value money above all else. 
   So it is clear that some people do stand to gain from PNTR and China's accession to the World Trade Organization. But I think that camp has vastly overstated its case. These forces, which have paid to pipe the siren song into the halls of the Senate for months now, claim, for example, that America's farmers will benefit greatly from PNTR for China. They wave impressive graphs, they promise access to vast markets. But I for one, as a Senator from a very important agriculture state, am not convinced that those claims are more than just empty promises. China's Vice Minister of Trade has already noted publicly that market-opening promises for U.S. wheat exporters are only a theoretical opportunity--not an actual one. The fact is that China's promises to import more agricultural products conflict with internal Chinese political and cultural dynamics--dynamics that are affected by longstanding fears about dependence on foreign food and by employment-creation imperatives. China has produced a glut of agricultural goods for years. Beijing now has massive stockpiles and a three-to-one ratio of exports to imports. Chinese prices will likely continue to be lower than American ones for years. I am not convinced that there is a big pay-off in store for American agriculture. 
   Ask Wisconsin's ginseng growers about the Chinese commitment to rule-governed trade. They will tell you that the Chinese have continued to mislabel their ginseng as ``Wisconsin-grown ginseng.'' As a result of this misleading practice, the price paid to actual American ginseng farmers has steadily declined. Recent press reports even suggest that the Chinese are now smuggling ginseng containing dangerously high levels of harmful pesticides and chemicals into U.S.--again inaccurately labeled as Wisconsin ginseng.  
   I concede, Mr. President, that profits are within the reach of some. And I recognize that the 
   business community is responsible to its shareholders. Seeking profitable opportunities is their very purpose, and there is nothing wrong with that. But this Senate is responsible to all of the citizens of the United States, to the core values of this country, and to future generations of Americans. And the United States of America does not stand only for profit. Even if I were convinced that Permanent Normal Trade relations with China and Beijing's accession to the WTO would bring significant new economic opportunities to a large number of Americans--and I am not convinced of this fact--I still believe it is my responsibility to weigh that factor against others--including the fact that the Chinese government's human rights record is unquestionably appalling. I still believe that certain economic gains are not worth their moral price. I still believe that the prosperity we all seek for our great country should never be a prosperity that also brings shame. 
   But de-linking trade from human rights and prohibiting an annual debate on this issue suggests that I do not have the right to weigh these factors, that I cannot consider the totality of U.S.-Chinese bilateral relations when matters of trade arise. Apparently, we are all simply supposed to follow the music. 
   I argue that to compartmentalize our national values is to cordon off our national identity, to subordinate what we stand for so completely that it no longer affects how we behave. That is dangerous. I think it is an abdication of the responsibility I accepted when I took this office. 
   So apart from the question--and it is a good question, a question not answered nearly so easily as the Administration would like--of whether or not a significant number of Americans will reap economic benefits from PNTR for China--and apart from legitimate questions grounded in the historical record about whether or not China will stick to its trade-related commitments--apart from these issues, we are debating whether or not to draw a sharp, impenetrable division between one of our interests--economic gain--and what we believe and who we are. That is the question that has been evaded in the mountains of pro-PNTR literature and the countless pro-PNTR briefings that have become a fixture on Capitol Hill in recent months. I cannot support such a division. I will not abdicate my responsibilities in the hopes of avoiding tough choices and decisions. I cannot support this bill. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a package of legislation (S. 3005 and S. Res. 348) that addresses the increased amount of smuggled and mis-labeled ginseng entering this country. 
   This legislation provides for some common sense reforms that would require country-of-origin labeling for ginseng products, and express the Sense of the Senate that customs should put a stop to the flow of smuggled ginseng into the United States. My legislation will push for stricter enforcement of ginseng importation and allow consumers the information they need to determine the origin of the ginseng they buy. 
   SMUGGLING-LABELING PROBLEM
   Mr. President, Chinese and Native American cultures have used ginseng for thousands of years for herbal and medicinal purposes. 
   In America, ginseng is experiencing a newfound popularity, and I am proud to say that my home state of Wisconsin is playing a central role in ginseng's resurgence. 
   Wisconsin produces 97 percent of the ginseng grown in the United States, and 85 percent of the country's ginseng is grown in Marathon County. 
   The ginseng industry is an economic boon to Marathon County, as well as an example of the high quality for which Wisconsin's agriculture industry is known. 
   Wisconsin ginseng commands a premium price in world markets because it is considered to be of the highest quality and because it has a lower pesticide and chemical content. 
   With a huge market for this high-quality ginseng overseas, and growing popularity for the ancient root here at home, Wisconsin's ginseng industry should have a prosperous future ahead. 
   Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious problem--smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is considered so superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go to great lengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as ``Wisconsin-grown.'' 
   Here's how the switch takes place: Smugglers take Asian or Canadian-grown ginseng and ship it to plants in China, allegedly to have the ginseng sorted into various grades. 
   While the sorting process is itself a legitimate part of distributing ginseng, smugglers often use it as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng with the Asian or Canadian ginseng considered inferior by consumers. 
   The smugglers know that while Chinese-grown ginseng has a retail value of about $5-$6 per pound, while Wisconsin-grown ginseng is valued at roughly $16-$20 per pound. 
   To make matters even tougher for Wisconsin's ginseng farmers, there is no accurate way of testing ginseng to determine where it was grown, other than testing for pesticides that are legal in Canada and China but are banned in the United States. 
   And in some cases, smugglers can even find ways around the pesticide tests. A recent ConsumerLab.com study confirmed that much of the ginseng sold in the U.S. contained harmful chemicals and metals, such as lead and arsenic. 
   And that's because the majority of Ginseng sold in the U.S. originates from countries with lower pesticide standards, so it's vitally important that consumers know which ginseng is really grown in Wisconsin 
   CONSUMER/PRODUCER IMPACT 
   For the sake of ginseng farmers and consumers, the U.S. Senate must crack down on smuggled and mislabeled ginseng. 
   Without adequate labeling, consumers have no way of knowing the most basic information about the ginseng they purchase--where it was grown, what quality or grade it is, or whether it contains dangerous pesticides. 
   The country of origin labeling is a simple but effective way to enable consumers to make an informed decision. And putting the U.S. Senate on record in support of cracking down on ginseng smuggling is an important first step toward putting an end to the illegal ginseng trade. 
   The lax enforcement of smuggled ginseng also puts our producers on an unfair playing field. The mixing of superior Wisconsin ginseng with lower quality foreign ginseng root penalizes the grower and eliminates the incentive to provide the consumer with a superior product. 
   Mr. President, we must give ginseng growers the support they deserve by implementing country-of-origin labeling that lets consumers make in formed choices about the ginseng that they consume. 
   We must ensure when ginseng consumers reach for a quality ginseng product--such as Wisconsin grown ginseng--that they are getting the real thing, not a cheap imitation.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleagues, Senator JEFFORDS and Senator KENNEDY, as an original cosponsor of the Older Workers Rights Restoration Act of 2000. 
   With advances in medicine and science, Americans are living longer than ever before. This means that older Americans are also working longer than ever before. We should ensure that those Americans who work well into the golden years of their lives--including state employees--can do so without fear of being denied a job, fired or overlooked for a promotion based on their age. 
   Since enactment of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in 1967, our Nation has come a long way in eliminating age discrimination in the workplace. But the Supreme Court's decision earlier this year in Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents threatens to turn back the clock on the progress we've made. Under that decision, a state employee who has a claim of employment discrimination based on age cannot bring a private lawsuit against a state government under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The state government is immune from such suits. The individual's only legal recourse is to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and hope that the EEOC takes the case. But the EEOC has limited resources and only pursues a fraction of the cases filed. 
   Mr. President, this result is unacceptable. Older American workers  make important contributions to their employers--both businesses and governments, at the state and federal levels. Older Americans should be able to work free of even a hint of discrimination. And older Americans employed by state governments deserve the same protections against discrimination on the job that other older Americans employed by private businesses or the federal government enjoy. 
   This bill that we introduce today would do just that. It ensures that state employees in federally assisted programs or activities have the same rights and remedies for practices violating the Age Discrimination in Employment Act as are available to other employees under that act and that were available to state employees prior to the Supreme Court's Kimel decision. 
   Mr. President, I have had a longstanding commitment to aging issues, both as a U.S. Senator and, previously, as a Wisconsin State Senator. In the U.S. Senate, I have served on the Special Committee on Aging. In the Wisconsin state senate, I served for ten years as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging. In fact, the first legislation I introduced as a state senator was a bill to eliminate mandatory retirement. That bill passed and was signed into law. As a result, older Wisconsin residents have the right to work without being forced to retire at a certain age. 
   I look forward to working with Senator JEFFORDS to move this important legislation through the Senate. I urge my colleagues to join us in taking this step toward restoring protections for state employees against age discrimination. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Department of Defense appropriations conference report that the Senate will pass today does not reflect the realities of the post-Cold War world in which our men and women in uniform serve this country. 
   I want to state very clearly, Mr. President, that my opposition to this bill should not be interpreted as a lack of support for our men and women in uniform. Rather, what I cannot support is the Cold War mentality that continues to permeate the United States defense establishment. 
   I strongly support our Armed Forces and the excellent work they are doing to combat the new threats of the 21st century and beyond. However, I am concerned that we are not giving our forces the tools they need to combat these emerging threats. Instead, this bill clings to the strategies and weapons that we used to fight--and win--the Cold War. 
   I say again today what I have said so many times before. The Cold War is over, Mr. President. It is time we stopped fighting it. 
   For example, as my colleagues know, I strongly support terminating production under the Navy's Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile program. During the recent consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001, I offered an amendment that would have terminated production of this Cold War-era weapon, which was designed specifically to be a first-strike strategic missile that would attack targets inside the Soviet Union from waters off the continental United States. 
   I deeply regret that the Senate did not adopt this amendment, and that production of the Trident II missile will continue for at least one more year. This conference report includes more than $433 million to purchase 12 more of these missiles, as well as another $9.5 million in advanced procurement funds for additional missiles the Navy hopes to buy in future years. 
   It is beyond my comprehension why the Navy needs more of these missiles when it already has 372 in its arsenal. Despite the fact that it already has ten submarines that are fully equipped with this devastating weapon, the Navy wants to backfit four of its older Trident I submarines with these newer weapons. To achieve this, the Navy wants to have a total of 425 of these missiles, so the President continues to request them in his 
   budget. And the Congress continues to spend the taxpayers' money on acquiring more Trident II missiles even as the United States negotiates further arms reductions with Russia. 
   I also continue to be deeply concerned about the Pentagon's procurement strategy for tactical aircraft. This conference report includes nearly $2.8 billion for the multi-year procurement of 42 of the Navy's FA-18E/F aircraft. My opinion on this program is well known. I have not been shy about highlighting the program's myriad flaws, not least of which is its inflated cost compared to the marginal at best improvement over the FA-18C/D aircraft. I am troubled that the Department of Defense and the Congress are committing $2.8 billion in taxpayer money to purchase 42 of these aircraft when there are still so many design problems that need to be overcome. And this is just the first installment for the taxpayers. The Navy hopes to eventually have a fleet of 548 of these aircraft. 
   The General Accounting Office concluded in a report issued in May 2000 that the noise and vibration problems with the aircraft's wings, which the Navy has known about since September 1997 but has not corrected, are sufficient cause to delay multi-year procurement of the FA-18E/F. GAO argued that if this problem is not corrected before full-rate production, costly retrofitting and redesign of the wings will likely be necessary later. The GAO report also outlined serious problems with the plane's engine. Despite GAO's recommendation, and despite the fact that, in a February 2000 report, the Department of Defense's own Commander of the Operational Test and Evaluation Force found that there are 27 major and 88 minor deficiencies in the aircraft, and that five of the major deficiencies concern its aerodynamic performance, the Pentagon has chosen to move forward with this costly multi-year procurement. 
   In my view, Mr. President, the Department of Defense should have been absolutely sure this aircraft's design problems were addressed before beginning a multi-year procurement process. I continue to have serious concerns with the safety, effectiveness, and cost of this plane. I will continue monitor closely this procurement, including attempts to resolve the problems outlined by GAO, and I will continue to scrutinize future appropriations requests for this program. 
   The Cold War-era Trident II missile and the new FA-18E/F aircraft are just two of the many examples of questionable spending in this bloated Defense Appropriations bill. 
   Mr. President, this debate is really one about priorities. Of course all of the members of this body would agree that we must maintain a strong national defense. Our debate should be about how we can best maintain a strong defense, modernize our forces to respond to the new threats of the 21st century, adequately compensate our men and 
   women in uniform, and reign in the out of control defense spending that continues to line the pockets of contractors around this country. 
   And it is high time that the Pentagon rethink its priorities. I am utterly appalled that at a time when members of our Armed Forces are on food stamps that this body tabled, by a 65-32 vote, an amendment offered by the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] to strike a provision in the Senate version of this bill which would allow the Secretaries of the Army and the Navy to spend taxpayers' money to lease nine so-called ``operational support aircraft.'' These aircraft are actually luxury jets that are used to transport high-level military officers. This provision, which was included in the pending conference report, will allow nine more of these jets to be leased, three each for the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The General Accounting Office has argued that such a lease is costly and unnecessary. 
   Mr. President, this bill exceeds the fiscal year 2000 level by nearly $20 billion. The Congress has given the Pentagon $3.3 billion more than it says it needs to defend this country. The Congress has added aircraft and ships that  the Pentagon did not request, and added spending in other areas, and somehow has not yet managed to fully fund the National Guard. 
   Mr. President, as I have said time and time again, there are millions upon millions of dollars in this bill that are being spent on out-dated or questionable or unwanted programs. This money would be better spent on programs that truly improve our readiness and modernize our Armed Forces instead of on programs that continue to defend us against the hammer and sickle that no longer looms across the ocean. This money also would be better spent on efforts to improve the morale of our forces, such fully manning and adequately compensating our National Guard; ensuring that all of our men and women in uniform have a decent standard of living; or providing better housing for our Armed Forces and their families. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern and the concerns of my constituents regarding Section 204 of the FY 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation now before us, the provision which affects the conservation of the silvery minnow. News of the showdown between federal and state agencies over the conservation of this fish on the Rio Grande has reached my state. My constituents are now concerned, Mr. President, about the impact this language will have on the future survival of this species, as well as the precedent that language of this type will have on the implementation of the Endangered Species Act in Wisconsin and across the country. They are so concerned, that on July 22, 2000 a constituent drove from Madison to a fair in Waukesha to speak to me about this matter and missed me by minutes. When constituents are that concerned, I have to bring it to the attention of other members of this body. 
   The White House on Friday threatened to veto the Energy and Water Development bill, in part because of this provision that could prevent protection of the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow. 
   I am concerned, Mr. President, that we would be seeking to take this action in this bill because, while we are here in Washington, in Albuquerque, federal, state, and environmental lawyers are continuing a federal court-ordered mediation. This mediation is seeking something much more important than legislative ink on the page, Mr. President, rather it seeks river water for the minnow before its critical habitat runs dry--unfortunately it could run dry potentially as soon as next week. 
   The Department of Interior, through its U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Reclamation, is trying to keep the minnow from oblivion. 
   Let me explain my concerns, Mr. President. They are concerned that Section 204 would prevent the Bureau of Reclamation from using any funds to open irrigation dams. It is the opening of those dams that would provide direct river flow to sustain the minnow. I understand that earlier this month, the Bureau of Reclamation caused concern within the irrigation district with its legal opinion that the government owns the dams. 
   I understand that legal ownership and contractual and other water rights issues in the West are extremely contentious. I am grateful to come from a riparian water rights state, and to avoid these kinds of disputes in Wisconsin. But, I'll tell you, Mr. President, Wisconsinites expect that Congress will stay out of this legal wrangling when a species' survival is at stake. 
   These dams help divert the flow of the river to some 10,000 farmers of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. The conservancy district holds long-standing rights to the water under state law, which does not recognize in-stream flow for fish as a beneficial use. But the Bureau of Reclamation has told the conservancy district that the dams must be operated so an in-stream flow of at least 300 cubic feet per second can sustain a 
   ``last stand'' surviving population of minnows downstream. 
   The White House has said ``the Administration strongly objects to provisions included in the Senate bill'' that would ``severly constrain'' the government's efforts to protect and sustain the minnow. Moreover the Office of Management and Budget has said that ``adequate flows'' must be ensured on the Rio Grande and warned that a ``failure to protect the minnow this year could lead to its extinction.'' 
   Mr. President, my constituents want the water managers and environmentalists to continue the court ordered mediation they have begun. The parties to the mediation are environmental groups; the conservancy district; the Bureau of Reclamation; the state water engineer; and the city of Albuquerque. 
   The Rio Grande silvery minnow occurs only in the middle Rio Grande. Threats to the species include dewatering, channelization and regulation of river flow to provide water for irrigation; diminished water quality caused by municipal, industrial, and agricultural discharges; and competition or predation by introduced non-native fish species. Currently, the species occupies about five percent of its known historic range. 
   This species was historically one of the most abundant and widespread fishes in the Rio Grande basin, occurring from New Mexico, to the Gulf of Mexico. It was also found in the Pecos River, a major tributary of the Rio Grande, from Santa Rosa, New Mexico, downstream to its confluence with the Rio Grande in south Texas. It is now completely extinct in the Pecos River and its numbers have severely declined within the Rio Grande. 
   Decline of the species in the Rio Grande probably began as early as the beginning of the 20th century when water manipulation began along the Rio Grande. Elephant Butte was the first of five major dams constructed within the silvery minnow's habitat. These dams allow the flow of the river to be manipulated and diverted for the benefit of agriculture. As times this manipulation resulted in the dewatering of some river reaches and elimination of all fish. Concurrent with construction of these dams, there was an increase in the abundance of non-native and exotic fish species, as these species were stocked into the reservoirs created by the dams. Once established, these species often out competed the native fish. 
   The only existing population of minnow continues to be threatened by annual dewatering of a large percentage of its habiat. My constituents want to be assured that their future survival is not threatened by legislative action. That is why I have strong concerns about this provision and would like to see that it is removed from the bill. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the continuing crisis in Indonesia and East Timor. 
   Earlier this week, a peacekeeper from New Zealand, Leonard William Manning, was killed while tracking a group of men whom senior officials in Timor have identified as militia members who had crossed into East Timor from Indonesia. Private Manning was serving the cause of peace, his death is tragic, and I want to take this opportunity to express my sympathy to his family. 
   In the wake of this incident, the United Nations Security Council and the ASEAN Regional Forum have called on Indonesia to disband and disarm the militias operating in the refugee camps of West Timor, and to stop the militias' cross-border incursions into East Timor. But Mr. President, this call has echoed around the world for months now. It is a call that has gone unheeded. 
   The activities of Indonesian militias threaten the stability of Indonesia, the safety of peacekeepers and humanitarian workers, and the basic human rights of Indonesians and East Timorese. It was the militia, Mr. President, that waged a brutal campaign of violence and destruction immediately after East Timor's vote for independence last year. It was the militia that enjoyed the direct support of the Indonesian military throughout that operation. And it is the militia that continues to operate in the refugee camps of West Timor, where the most vulnerable East Timorese are subjected to threats and intimidation. It is the militia that has forced UNHCR to suspend operations in West Timor after a series of violent assaults on its staff. 
   I believe that many in the Indonesian government, including President Wahid, want to stop the militia violence and to end the intimidation in the refugee camps. But they are unable to make this happen, because too many people in powerful positions in Indonesia remain unwilling to make it happen. And that, Mr. President, is all that this country needs to know when the question of resuming military relations with Indonesia comes up. 
   Ominous reports of a deeply disturbing relationship between the Indonesian military and the militias continue to pour out of the region. Peacekeepers on the ground in East Timor have noted that the group that attacked Private Manning appeared to have benefitted from serious and significant military training. At one point recently, UNHCR personnel 
   witnessed militiamen beat a refugee from East Timor and rob several others while a 70-strong Indonesian military detachment witnessed the incident but did not intervene. 
   And it's not just Timor, Mr. President. In the Moluccas, where sectarian violence has risen to such alarming levels that many have pondered international intervention, reliable reports indicate the Indonesian military has been complicit in the conflict, and has even provided support to certain factions. In Papua, or Irian Jaya, militia groups have already taken violent action against community leaders. 
   The simple and unfortunate facts, Mr. President, are that a power struggle continues in Indonesia, between those committed to a responsible and professional military operating under civilian control, and those who would cling to the abusive patterns of the past. I have introduced a bill, the East Timor Repatriation and Security Act of 2000, which would codify a suspension of military and security relations with and assistance to Indonesia until certain conditions are met. This legislation would permit military and security programs from J-CETS to military sales to resume only when the President determines and submits a report to the appropriate congressional committees that the Government of Indonesia and the Indonesian Armed Forces are doing the following-- 
   Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed forces and militia groups against whom there is credible evidence of human rights violations; 
   Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed forces against whom there is credible evidence of aiding or abetting militia groups; 
   Allowing displaced persons and refugees to return home to East Timor, including providing safe passage for refugees returning from West Timor; 
   Not impeding the activities of the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor; 
   Demonstrating a commitment to preventing incursions into East Timor by members of militia groups in West Timor; and 
   Demonstrating a commitment to accountability by cooperating with investigations and prosecutions of members of the Indonesian Armed Forces and military groups responsible for human rights violations in Indonesia and East Timor. 
   These certainly are not unreasonable conditions. They work in favor of the forces of reform within Indonesia. And by linking military and security assistance to these benchmarks, Congress will ensure that the U.S. relationship with Jakarta avoids the mistakes of the past, and that U.S. foreign policy comes closer to reflecting our core national values. 
   But recent events make it crystal clear that these conditions have not yet been met. Mr. President, the U.S. must continue to insist on them. In the pursuit of justice, in the pursuit of stability, and in support of the forces of reform, this country cannot send a signal that where we are today is somehow good enough. Again, Mr. President, I add my voice to the chorus, because U.S., Indonesian, and Timorese  interests all demand that the militias be stopped and that the military must be united in the pursuit of professionalism, accountability, and civilian control.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at the very foundation of our system of justice is the notion that judges will be fair and impartial. Strict ethical guidelines have been in effect for years to remove even the hint of impropriety from the conduct of those we entrust with the responsibility of adjudicating disputes and applying the law. 
   In recent years, there have been disturbing reports of judges participating in legal education seminars sponsored and paid for by organizations that simultaneously fund federal court litigation on the same topics that are covered by the seminars. Some of these seminars have a clearly biased agenda in favor a certain legal philosophy. A recent report released by Community Rights Counsel found that at least 1,030 federal judges took over 5,800 privately funded trips between 1992 and 1998. The appearance created by these seminars is not consistent with the image of an impartial judiciary. 
   Some of these seminars are conducted at posh vacation resorts in locations such as Amelia Island, Florida and Hilton Head, South Carolina, and include ample time for expense-paid recreation. These kinds of education/vacation trips, which have been valued at over $7,000 in some cases, create an appearance that the judges who attend are profiting from their positions. Again, this is an appearance that is at odds with the traditions of our judiciary. 
   One-sided seminars given in wealthy resorts funded by wealthy corporate interests to ``educate'' our judges in a particular view of the law cannot help but undermine public confidence in the decisions that judges who attend the seminars ultimately make. I am pleased, therefore, to join with my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY, to introduce the Judicial Education Reform Act of 2000. Our bill instructs the judicial conference to issue guidelines prohibiting judges from attending privately funded education seminars. The bill also authorizes $2 million per year over five years so that the Federal Judicial Center, FJC, can reimburse judges for seminars they wish to attend, as long as those seminars are approved by the FJC under guidelines that will ensure that the seminars are balanced and will maintain public confidence in the judiciary. And the bill makes clear that the FJC cannot reimburse judges for the expense of recreational activities at the seminars. 
   Mr. President, I have expressed concern throughout my time in the Congress about the improper influence of campaign contributions and gifts on members of Congress and the executive branch. Community Rights Counsel's report has turned the spotlight on the judicial branch and what it reveals is not at all comforting. The influence of powerful interests on judicial decision-making through these education seminars should concern everyone who believes in the rule of law in this country. If judges are seen to be under the influence of the wealthy and powerful in our society, ``equal justice under law'' will become an empty platitude rather than a powerful aspiration for the greatest judicial system on earth. I believe this bill will help us fulfill the promise of that great aspiration, and I hope my colleagues will join Senator KERRY and me in supporting it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss moving to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. 
   I agree with the Majority Leader and others who have come to the floor this year to insist that we do the people's business, and that the people's business means completing all of the appropriations bills. 
   There are several very important amendments that will be proposed to this legislation, and we must give them the time and consideration they deserve. I may well vote against the  Treasury-Postal appropriations bill in the end, but I recognize the importance of taking it up, considering it, and getting it done. 
   We have got to take care of the unfinished business. 
   We have more appropriations bills to consider, and we have other business as well, as my colleagues are well aware. 
   I find it interesting to look at some of the other measures we have considered, and still might consider, this year. 
   I am talking about priorities--what we get done on this floor, and what gets ignored. 
   As I said, it is essential that we pass these appropriations bills--they are the core of the people's business, because they keep the government up and running. 
   But beyond bills like Treasury-Postal, what are we choosing to do? 
   Recently, we chose to consider a repeal of the estate tax. As I said during that debate, the estate tax affects only the wealthiest property-holders. In 1997, only 42,901 estates paid the tax. That's the wealthiest 1.9 percent. People are already exempt from the tax in 98 out of 100 cases. Let me repeat that: Already, under current law, 98 out of 100 do not pay any estate tax. 
   The Republican estate tax repeal would give the wealthiest 2,400 estates--the ones that pay now half the estate tax--an average tax cut of $3.4 million each. And remember, 98 out of 100 people would get zero, nothing, from this estate tax cut. 
   Now, this doesn't sound like something most Americans are clamoring for. 
   It is of no use to most Americans, in fact. But it is of use to a very small--but wealthy--group of people. 
   Those who are wealthy enough to be subject to estate taxes have great political power. 
   They can make unlimited political contributions, and they are represented in Washington by influential lobbyists that have pushed hard to get the estate tax bill to the floor. 
   The estate tax is one of those issues where political money seems to have an impact on the legislative outcome. That's why I recently Called the Bankroll on some of the interests behind that bill, to give my colleagues and the public a sense of the huge amount of money at stake--not taxes, but political contributions. 
   We considered that bill not because it affected the vast majority of Americans, but because it directly affected the pocketbooks of a wealthy few. 
   A similar point can be made about another piece of legislation, the H-1B bill. 
   We haven't considered it yet, but we may 
   well yet, and so far a terrific effort has been made by both sides to see it taken up. 
   Why? Why, when we have more appropriations bills to consider, when we have the real people's business to do, are we pushing so hard to take up H-1B? 
   Because the high-tech industry wants this bill to get done. 
   In the case of H-1B, I'm not addressing the merits of the legislation-- I am not necessarily opposed to raising the level of H-1B visas. Instead I want to point out what is on our agenda and why? Why is it that we have this set of legislation as part of our agenda? 
   The high tech industry wants to get this bill passed, and they have the political contributions to back it up. 
   American Business for Legal Immigration, a coalition which formed to fight for an increase in H-1B visas, offers a glimpse of the financial might behind proponents of H-1Bs. ABLI is chock full of big political donors, and not just from one industry, but from several different industries that have an interest in bringing more high-tech workers into the U.S. 
   Price Waterhouse Coopers, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, telecommunications giant and former Baby Bell BellSouth, and software company Oracle, to name just a few. 
   All have given hundreds of thousands of dollars in this election cycle alone, and they want us to pass H-1B. 
   We all know this. 
   This is standard procedure these days for wealthy interests --you have got to pay to play on the field of politics. You've got to pony up for quarter-million dollar soft money contributions and half-million dollar issue ad campaigns, and anyone who can't afford the price of admission is going to be left out in the cold.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the big lie led to the transformation of our two great political parties into soft money machines. And what was the effect of this explosion of soft money, other than the millions of dollars available for ads supporting presidential candidates who had agreed to  run their campaigns on equal and limited grants from the federal taxpayers? Soft money is raised primarily from corporate interests who have a legislative axe to grind. And so the explosion of soft money brought an explosion of influence and access in this Congress and in the Administration. 
   Here are some of the companies in this exclusive group. We know they have a big interest in what the Congress does--Philip Morris, Joseph Seagram & Sons, RJR Nabisco, Walt Disney, Atlantic Richfield, AT&T, Federal Express, MCI, the Association of Trial Lawyers, the NEA, Lazard Freres & Co., Anheuser Busch, Eli Lilly, Time Warner, Chevron Corp., Archer Daniel's Midland, NYNEX, Textron Inc., Northwest Airlines. It's a who's who of corporate America, Mr. President. They are investors in the United States Congress and no one can convince the American people that these companies get no return on their investment. 
   They have a say, much too big a say, in what we do. It's that simple, and it's that disturbing. That's why our priorities are so out of whack, Mr. President. We should be going to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, and that's why I support the motion to proceed, despite the fact that I may vote against it when all is said and done. I recognize we have to focus on what people want, not what wealthy interests want. 
   As I said when I first began Calling the Bankroll last year, we know, if we are honest with ourselves, that campaign contributions are involved in virtually everything that this body does. Campaign money is the 800-pound gorilla in this chamber every day that nobody talks about, but that cannot be ignored. All around us, and all across the country, people notice the gorilla. Studies come out on a weekly basis from a variety of research organizations and groups that lobby for campaign finance reform that show what we all know: The agenda of the Congress seems to be influenced by campaign money. But in our debates here, we are silent about that influence, and how it corrodes our system of government. 
   I have chosen not to remain silent, but I know there are those who wish that I would stop putting the spotlight on facts that reflect poorly on our system, and in turn on the Senate, and on both the major political parties. 
   I wish our campaign finance system wasn't such an embarrassment. 
   I wish wealthy interests with business before this body didn't have unlimited ability to give money to our political parties through the soft money loophole, but they do. 
   I wish these big donors weren't able to buy special access to our political leaders through meetings and weekend retreats set up by the parties, but they can. 
   I wish fundraising skills and personal wealth weren't some of the most sought-after qualities in a candidate for Congress today, but everyone knows that they are. 
   Most of all I wish that these facts didn't paint a picture of Government so corrupt and so awash in the influence of money that the American people, especially young people, have turned away from their government in disgust, but every one of us knows that they have. 
   It is our unwillingness to discuss it or even acknowledge the influence of this money in this body that makes it even worse. 
   It goes on and on, and it just gets worse. 
   Last year was another record-breaker in the annals of soft money fundraising--the national political party committees raised a record $107.2 million during the 1999 calendar year--81 percent more than they raised during the last comparable presidential election period in 1995, according to Common Cause. 
   An 81 percent increase is astounding, especially considering that the year it's compared with--1995, the last off-election year preceding a presidential election--which was itself a record-breaking year for soft money fundraising. 
   This year one of the most notable fundraising trends hits very close to home, or to the dome, as the case may be: Congressional campaign committees raised more than three times as much soft money during 1999 as they raised during 1995--$62 million compared to $19.4 million. 
   That is a huge increase, Mr. President. 
   Three times as much soft money--much of it raised by members of Congress. 
   Now the latest news reports show record-breaking soft money figures for the first quarter of this year as well. 
   How should the public view this? 
   What can we expect them to think as Members of Congress ask for these unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals, and then turn around and vote on legislation that directly affects those donors that they just asked for all this money? 
   Frankly, it is all the more reason for Americans to question our integrity, whether those donations have an impact on our decisions or not. 
   They question our integrity, and we give them reason. Why aren't we getting their business done? I say let's get the business done--let's agree to move to Treasury-Postal, whether we'll support that bill in the end or not. And then let's move on to the other pressing issues before us--not tax cuts for the wealthy, but real priorities like campaign finance reform. 
   Let's put a stop to the soft money arms race that escalates every day, and involves more and more Members of Congress. 
   I do not know how many of my colleagues are actually picking up the phones across the street in our party committee headquarters to ask corporate CEOs for soft money contributions. But no one here can deny that our parties are asking us to do this. It is now part of the parties' expectations that a United States Senator will be a big solicitor of soft money. 
   Consider the soft money raised in recent off-year elections. In 1994, the parties raised a total of $101.7 million. Only about $18.5 million of that amount was raised by the congressional and senatorial campaign committees. In 1998, the most recent election, soft money fundraising more than doubled to $224.4 million. And $107 million of that total was raised by the congressional and senatorial campaign committees. That's nearly half of the total soft money raised by the parties. 
   Half the soft money that the parties raised in the last election went to the campaign committees for members of Congress, as opposed to the national party committees. And I and many of my colleagues know from painful experience that much of that money ended up being spent on phony issue ads in Senate races. The corporate money that has been banned in federal elections since 1907 is being raised by Senators and spent to try to influence the election of Senators. This has to stop. 
   The growth of soft money has made a mockery of our campaign finance laws. It has turned Senators into panhandlers for huge contributions from corporate patrons. And it has multiplied the number of corporate interests who have a claim on the attention of members and the work of this institution. 
   I truly believe that we must do much more than ban soft money to fix our campaign finance system. But if there is one thing more than any other that must be done now it is to ban soft money. Otherwise the soft money loophole will completely obliterate the Presidential public funding system, and lead to scandals that will make what we saw in 1996 seem quaint. Virtually no one in this body has stepped up to defend soft money. So let's get rid of it once and for all. Now is the time. Let's move to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, vote yes or no, and then let's do what we have to get done. 
   When we define what we need to get done this year, let's get serious. It is not the estate tax, and it's not the H-1B bill. It's banning soft money. 
   Now there is more support for banning soft money than ever before. 
   I think it is important to talk on this floor about just who those Americans are who want to clean up this campaign finance system, because today calls for reform are coming from an incredible range of people in this country, including some very unlikely places. 
   One of the most interesting places you can find demands for reform is corporate America, where one group of corporate executives, tired of being shaken down for bigger and bigger contributions, has said enough is enough.  
   This organization, called the Committee for Economic Development, issued a report and proposal urging reform, including the elimination of soft money. 
   One might guess that this group of people, who are in the position to use the soft money system to their advantage, would not dream of calling for reform. 
   But the soft money system cuts both ways--it not only allows for legalized bribery of the political parties, it also allows legalized extortion of soft money donors, who are being asked to give more and more money every election cycle to fuel the parties' bottomless appetite for soft money. 
   But it isn't just weariness at being shaken 
   down that led CED members to call for reform of our broken campaign finance system. Let me quote from the CED report, which stated their concern so well:  
   Given the size and source of most soft money contributions, the public cannot help but believe that these donors enjoy special influence and receive special favors. The suspicion of corruption diminishes public confidence in government.  
   The bigger soft money contributions get--and the amounts are truly skyrocketing--the more damaging the effect on the public's perception of our democracy. 
   I applaud CED for its commitment to restoring the public's faith in government by calling for a soft money ban. 
   And CED is just one part of a growing movement to call on this body to clean up our campaign finance system. 
   One of the most inspiring leaders of the movement for reform is not any business leader, or political figure for that matter. She is a great grandmother from Dublin, New Hampshire named Doris Haddock. Doris, known affectionately as Granny D, walked clear across the United States at age 90 to insist that Congress pay attention to reform issues. 
   She walked across mountains and desert, in sweltering heat and freezing cold, to make her point. And along the way she inspired thousands of others to speak up about the corrupting influence of money in politics, and demand action from Congress. I was proud to have her support for the McCain-Feingold bill, and I am thrilled to have such a devoted ally on this issue. 
   The fight for reform is also gaining tremendous strength from religious organizations that are reaching out to educate and mobilize their congregations about the issue. 
   Support from religious organizations includes: The Episcopal Church, Church Women United, the Lutheran Office for Governmental Affairs, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the Church of the Brethren's Washington Office, the Mennonite Central Committee's Washington Office, the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the United Church of Christ's Office for Church in Society, the United Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society, and NETWORK--a national Catholic social justice lobby. 
   Reform has the vital support of environmental groups like the Environmental Defense Fund, Friends of the Earth and The Sierra Club, and the backing of seniors groups like AARP and the Gray Panthers. 
   The support for reform in this country is strong, it is vocal, and is truly broad-based. We also have the support of consumer watchdogs like the Consumer Federation of America, health organizations like the American Heart Association, children's groups such as the Children's Defense Fund, and of course the support of groups like Common Cause and Public Citizen, which have been fighting a terrific fight against the undue influence of money in politics for decades. 
   And I could go on. We are talking about people from every walk of life, every income level and every political affiliation. But they all have one simple thing in common: They are demanding an end to the soft money system that has made a mockery of our campaign finance laws, has deepened public cynicism about this body, and darkened the public perception of our democracy. 
   The public is watching us right now. That is why I want us to move to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, whether we support it or not--so that they can have faith that we are doing what we should be doing. Not serving wealthy interests, but doing their business, and doing it responsibly. 
   And being responsible means acting on campaign finance reform. 
   That is what people want--their voices can be heard loud and clear in polls on the campaign finance issue: 
   Two out of three Americans think money has an ``excessive influence'' on elections and government policy, according to 
   Committee for Economic Development's March 1999 report on campaign finance reform. 
   Another CED poll question revealed that two-thirds of the public think ``their own representative in Congress would listen to the views of outsiders who made large political contributions before a constituent's views''; 
   74.5 percent of respondents believe the Government is pretty much run by a few big interests looking out for themselves, according to a poll from the Center for Policy Attitudes; 
   78 percent of respondents believe ``the current set of laws that control congressional campaign funding needs reform,'' in a Hotline poll. 
   These numbers are even more disturbing than the numbers of the soft money donations themselves. 
   These numbers tell us that it's a given today that people think the worst of us and the work we do--they believe that we are on the take, and who could possibly blame them? 
   What is it that they do not understand, that they are misinterpreting about this system and how it affects us? Nothing; the public has not missed a thing. 
   The public has got it exactly right. It is this body that has it wrong every time a minority of my colleagues block the majority of the Senate and will of the American people by trying to kill reform. 
   The public deserves a Congress that can respond to the concerns of all Americans, not a wealthy few. 
   The public deserves a responsible Congress that does its job by moving to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, whether we choose to vote yes or no, and the same goes for the other remaining approps bills that deserve our attention. 
   Most of all, the public deserves a Congress that can set priorities that represent the concerns of the American people, and not just soft money donors, not just those who can afford to attend weekend getaways with party leadership, and not just those who have estates of more than $100 million dollars. 
   That is our challenge. Let's address the people's real priorities. Let's do the people's business, and let's get started right now. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000. This bill recognizes the awesome and terrible scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and responds with what is truly required to address it--a program far more comprehensive and substantial than what is entailed in the status quo. 
   The numbers one must use to describe the crisis are numbing. More than 70 percent of all people living with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa, and as the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, I have seen firsthand the devastating toll that the disease has taken in the region. In Africa alone, 15,900,000 people have died because of AIDS, and the World Bank has identified the disease as the fastest-growing threat to development in the region. Life expectancies are dropping dramatically, and the social fall-  out from this horrific upheaval has forced us to confront the disease not just as an epidemiological threat, but as a security threat as well. Nearly 4,500,000 children have HIV and more are being infected at the rate of one child every minute. According to UNAIDS, by the end of 1999, AIDS had left 13,200,000 orphaned children in its wake. 
   This bill is a serious effort to confront this monstrous crisis. It will provide hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to strengthen prevention efforts, to combat mother-to-child transmission, to improve access to testing, counseling, and care, and to assist the orphans left in the wake of the disease. Through a new AIDS trust fund, it will leverage U.S. assistance with a multilateral approach and through innovative partnerships with the private sector. The bill provides support to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, so that even as we address the urgent needs of the present, we work toward a solution in the future. The bill insists that AIDS education be provided to troops trained under the auspices of the African Crisis Response Initiative. It recognizes the inextricable link between HIV/AIDS and the resurgence of tuberculosis. It goes beyond the President's request and beyond anything that this Congress has contemplated since the epidemic began. 
   The bill is not perfect, of course. The needs are great and the problem multi-faceted. I would still like to see this Congress address the important issue of access to pharmaceuticals, and to put strong language into statute that would prohibit the executive branch from pressuring countries in crisis to revoke or change laws aimed at increasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question adhere to existing international regulations governing trade. This bill does not absolve this Senate of a continued responsibility to address the global AIDS crisis. But it is remarkable, all the same. 
   This bill has the unanimous support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senators HELMS, BOXER, FRIST, KERRY, and BIDEN have worked on it tirelessly. It includes provisions originally drafted in the Mother-to-Child HIV Prevention Act, a bill authored by Senator MOYNIHAN of which I was proud to be an original co-sponsor. It reflects the admirable work of the House and in particular of Congresswoman BARBARA LEE and Congressman LEACH, and it should reach the President's desk quite quickly. Rarely does such a substantive, ground-breaking bill enjoy this degree of bipartisan consensus. It is a tribute to my colleagues and a testimony to the undeniable magnitude and urgency of the crisis that the Senate stands ready to pass this legislation today. 
   Just days ago, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. When he was speaking about the AIDS crisis, he spoke of its impact and of the place the epidemic has already taken in history, and said, ``All of us will have to ask ourselves, when our careers are done, did we address this problem?'' This bill is an important part of the answer to that question.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, sending inmates to prisons built and run by prviate companies has become a popular way to deal with overcrowded prisons, but in recent years this practice has been appropriately criticized. As reports of escapes, riots, prisoner violence, and abuse by staff in private prisons increase, many have questioned the wisdom and propriety of private companies carrying out this essential state function. After considering safety, cost, and accountability issues, it is clear that private companies should not be doing this public work. Government and only government, whether it's federal, state, or local, should operate prisons. That is why I rise today to introduce a bill that will restore responsibility for housing prisoners to the state and federal government, where it belongs. An identical bill was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman TED STRICKLAND, where it has received broad bi-partisan support and currently has 141 cosponsors. 
   Private prison companies, and proponents of their use, claim that they save taxpayers money. They claim private companies can do the government's business more efficiently, but this has never been confirmed. In fact, two government studies show that it is far from clear whether private prisons save taxpayer money. One study, completed by the GAO, stated that it could not conclude whether or not privatization saved money. The second study, completed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1998, concluded that there is no strong evidence to show states save money by using private prisons. 
   More importantly, private prison companies are motivated by one goal: making a profit. Decisions by these companies are driven by the desire to make a profit and, in turn, please officers and shareholders. This profit motive in the context of housing criminals is wrong. It is at cross-purposes with the government's goal of punishing and rehabilitating criminals. 
   So what happens when a private company runs a prison? The prisons have promised to save taxpayers money, so they cut costs. This invariably results in unqualified, low paid employees, poor facilities and living conditions, and an inadequate number of educational and rehabilitative programs. Recent episodes of escape, violence, and prisoner abuse demonstrate what happens when corners are cut. 
   At the Northeast Ohio Correctional facility, a private prison in Youngstown, Ohio, 20 inmates were stabbed, two of them fatally, within a 10-month period. After management claimed they had addressed the problems, six inmates, four convicted of homicide, escaped by cutting through two razor wire fences in the middle of the afternoon. 
   At a private prison in Whiteville, Tennessee, which houses many inmates from my home state of Wisconsin, there has been a hostage situation, an assault of a guard, and a coverup to hide physical abuse of inmates by prison guards. A security report at the same Tennessee prison found unsecured razors, inmates obstructing views into their cells by covering up windows, and an inmate using a computer lab strictly labeled, ``staff only'' without any supervision. 
   At a private prison in Sayre, Oklahoma, a dangerous inmate uprising jeopardized the security and control of the facility. As a result, the state of Oklahoma removed all its inmates from the facility and questioned its safety. Because the prison gets paid based on the number of inmates, however, the prison continued to request, and other states sent, hundreds of inmates to be housed there. 
   Earlier this year the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, the second largest private prison company in the United States, charging that in one of its juvenile prisons, conditions were ``dangerous and life threatening.'' A group of experts who toured the prison reported that many of the juveniles were short of food, had lost weight, and did not have shoes or blankets. The Department of Justice lawsuit also alleges that inmates did not receive adequate mental health care or educational programming. In addition to the poor conditions and lack of training, the guards physically abused the boys and threw gas grenades into their barracks. Some juvenile inmates even tried to commit suicide or deliberately injure themselves so they would be sent to the infirmary to avoid abuse by the guards. 
   Mr. President, the profit motive clearly has a dangerous and harmful effect on the security of private prisons, but the profit motive also shortchanges inmates of the rehabilitation, education, and training that they need. Private prisons get paid based on the number of inmates they house. This means the more inmates they accept and the fewer services they provide, the more money they make. A high crime rate means more business and eliminates any motivation to provide job training, education, and other rehabilitative programs. These allegations of abuse and the negative effects of the profit motive are especially troubling because they have a disparate impact on the minority community, which has been incarcerated disproportionately in recent years particularly with the rise of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses. 
   Another issue of concern is accountability for dispensing one of the strongest punishments our society can impose. Incarceration requires a government to exercise its coercive police powers over individuals, including the authority to take away a person's freedom and to use force. This authority to use force should not be delegated to a private company that is not accountable to the people. This premise was reinforced by the Supreme Court in Richardson v. McKnight, which held that private prison personnel are not covered by the qualified immunity that shields state and local correctional officers. This means that a state or local government could be held liable for the actions of a private corporation. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today, the Public Safety Act, addresses these concerns. It restores control and management of prisons to the government. It makes federal grants under Title II of the Crime Control Act of 1994 contingent upon states agreeing not to contract with any private companies to provide core correctional services related to transportation or incarceration of inmates. The legislation was carefully crafted to apply only to core correctional services meaning that private companies can still provide auxiliary services such as food or clothing. 
   Mr. President, let us restore safety and security to the many Americans who work in prisons. Let us protect the communities that support prisons. And let us ensure rehabilitation and safety for the individuals, including young boys and girls, who are housed there. This bill returns to the government the function of being the sole administrator of incarceration as punishment in our society. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of the Public Safety Act. 
   I ask that the text of the bill be placed in the RECORD following this statement.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this conference report is evidence of a missed opportunity. It is, in fact, yet another in what is becoming a series of missed opportunities. Today, the majority is missing the opportunity to enact marriage penalty relief. 
   The majority is missing that opportunity by insisting on its poorly-targeted, expensive tax breaks. It is missing that opportunity by rejecting the better-targeted, more responsible Democratic alternative. And it is missing that opportunity by rejecting President Clinton's offer to enact both marriage penalty relief and prescription drug benefits. 
   Everyone in this chamber wants marriage penalty relief. The question now is how we transform that wish into law. 
   By presenting the Senate with this conference report, the majority shows that it would rather have marriage penalty relief next year than this year. For now, they appear to prefer an old issue to a new law. 
   The majority continues today to pass poorly-targeted, expensive tax breaks. Earlier this week, the Treasury Department released a study that analyzed all the major tax cuts that the majority has passed in this Congress this year to date. 
   That study found that more than three-fourths of the benefits of the Republican tax bills would go to the best-off fifth of the population--those making more than $82,000. 
   The study found that those in the best-off fifth of the population would get an average tax cut of more than $2,000 a year, while those in the middle fifth would get less than $200. Republicans want to spend 10 times as much on the best-off than on middle-income families. 
   The study found that almost half of the benefits of the Republican tax bills would go to the best-off 5 percent, those with incomes over $150,000. 
   The study found that more than a quarter of the benefits of the Republican tax bills would go to the best-off one percent--those with incomes over $346,000--who would get an average tax cut of more than $15,000 a year.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened to hear of Paul Coverdell's untimely passing. Paul was a man of such energy and determination, it is difficult to imagine this body without him. Paul was a skilled legislator and one of the hardest working legislators among us. I had the highest admiration for the way he conducted himself here--how committed he was to the people of his state, and to his many duties here in the Senate. 
   We did not agree on a lot of policy matters, but that couldn't be less important as I stand here today, Mr. President. We've all lost a colleague and a friend, who was taken from this earth far too soon. At 61, Paul had served his country in more ways than most Americans can hope to in a lifetime. From his service in the Armed Forces to the Peace Corps to the Foreign Relations Committee, where we served together, Paul had a keen understanding of foreign affairs. He was also a natural leader, despite his soft-spoken personality and his habit of avoiding the limelight. He served as the minority leader in the Georgia State Senate from 1974 to 1989, attaining that post just four years after he was elected to the State Senate in 1970. 
   Paul and I were both first elected to the Senate in 1992, Mr. President. We arrived here at the same time, both former State Senators who had the honor of coming here and learning the ways of this Senate. And learn them Paul did. He quickly rose through the ranks to a top leadership post. And along the way he won the respect and admiration of all who knew him. The nation has lost a skilled leader, and all of us have lost an honorable colleague and friend. I join my colleagues in mourning his passing, and in paying tribute to his memory. To his wife Nancy, his family, his staff and his many friends, I offer my condolences and my deepest sympathies. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2000. This legislation contains adjustments to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) that will streamline and improve the process of awarding attorney's fees to private parties who prevail in litigation against the Federal government. This is the third Congress in which I have introduced this legislation. I believe these reforms are an important step in reducing the burden of defending government litigation for many individuals and small businesses. 
   I am very pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation this year by my friend from Arkansas, Sen. TIM HUTCHINSON. We hope that by working on a bipartisan basis on this important project we can improve the chances that it can become law. 
   Over the years, and certainly now in this election year, members of Congress often speak of ``getting government off the backs of the American people.'' Sometimes we disagree about when government is a burden and when it is giving a helping hand. But all of us in the Senate want to reform government in ways that will improve the lives of people all across this nation. The legislation we are proposing today deals directly with a problem that affects everyday Americans who face legal battles with the federal government and prevail. Even if they win in court, they may still lose financially because of the expense of paying their attorneys. 
   At the outset, it is important to understand what the Equal Access to Justice Act is, and why it exists. The premise of this statute is very simple. EAJA places individuals and small businesses who face the United States Government in litigation on more equal footing with the government by establishing guidelines for the award of attorney's fees when the individual or small business prevails. Quite simply, EAJA acknowledges that the resources available to the federal government in a legal dispute far outweigh those available to most Americans. This disparity is lessened by requiring the government in certain instances to pay the attorneys' fees of successful private parties. By giving successful parties the right to seek attorneys' fees from the United States, EAJA seeks to prevent small business owners and individuals from having to risk their companies or their family savings in order to seek justice. 
   My interest in this issue predates my election to the Senate. It arises from my experience both as a private attorney and a Member of the state Senate in my home state of Wisconsin. While in private practice, I became aware of how the ability to recoup attorney's fees is a significant factor, and often one of the first considered, when deciding whether or not to seek redress in the courts or to defend a case. Upon entering the 
   Wisconsin State Senate, I authored legislation modeled on the federal law, which had been championed by one of my predecessors in this body from Wisconsin, Senator Gaylord Nelson. Today, section 814.246 of the Wisconsin statutes contains provisions similar to the federal EAJA statute. 
   It seemed to me then, as it does now, that we should do all that we can to help ease the financial burdens on people who need to have their claims reviewed and decided by impartial decision makers. To this end, I have reviewed the existing federal statutes with an eye toward improving them and making them work better. The bill Senator HUTCHINSON and I are introducing today does a number of things to make EAJA more effective for individuals and small business men and women all across this country. 
   First and most important, this legislation eliminates the provision in current law that allows the government to avoid paying attorneys' fees when it loses a suit if it can show that its position was substantially justified. I believe that this high threshold for obtaining attorneys' fees is unfair. If an individual or small business battles the federal government in an adversarial proceeding and prevails, the government should simply pay the fees incurred. Imagine the scenario of a small business that spends time and money dueling with the government and wins, only to find out that it must now undertake the additional step of litigating the justification of government's litigation position. For the government, with its vast resources, this second litigation over fees poses little difficulty, but for the citizen or small business it may simply not be financially feasible. 
   Not only is this additional step a financial burden on the private litigant, but a 1992 study also reveals that it is unnecessary and a waste of government resources. University of Virginia Professor Harold Krent on behalf of the Administrative Conference of the United States found that only a small percentage of EAJA awards were denied because of the substantial justification defense. While it is impossible to determine the exact cost of litigating the issue of subtantial justification, it is Prof. Krent's opinion, based upon review of cases in 1989 and 1990, that while the substantial justification defense may save some money, it was not enough to justify the cost of the additional litigation. In short, eliminating this often burdensome second step is a cost effective step which will streamline recovery under EAJA and may very well save the government money in the long run. 
   The second part of this legislation that will streamline and improve EAJA is a provision designed to encourage settlement and avoid costly and protracted litigation. Under the bill, the government can make an offer of settlement after an application for fees and other expenses has been filed. If the government's offer is rejected and the prevailing party seeking recovery ultimately wins a smaller award, that  party is not entitled to the attorneys' fees and costs incurred after the date of the government's offer. Again, this will encourage settlement, speed the claims process, and thereby reduce the time and expense of the litigation. 
   The final improvement to EAJA included in this legislation is the removal of the carve out of cases where the prevailing party is eligible to get attorneys fees under section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under current law, EAJA is inapplicable in cases where a taxpayer prevails against the government. I was an original cosponsor of a bill that suggested a similar reform introduced by Senator LEAHY of Vermont in the last Congress. This provision helps to level the playing field between the IRS and everyday citizens. There is no reason that taxpayers should be treated differently than any other party that prevails in a case against the government. They deserve to have their fees paid if they win. 
   We all know that the American small business owner has a difficult road to make ends meet and that unnecessary or overly burdensome government regulation can be a formidable obstacle to doing business. It can be the difference between success or failure. The Equal Access to Justice Act was conceived and implemented to help balance the formidable power of the federal government. It has already helped many Americans. The legislation we are offering today will make EAJA more effective for more Americans while at the same time helping to deter the government from acting in an indefensible and unwarranted manner.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this motion requires we do first things first. It says we should pass marriage penalty relief, but it also says we should substantially extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare at the same time. By 2037, the Social Security trust fund will have consumed all of its assets. By 2025, the Medicare HI trust fund will have consumed all of its assets. 
   To fix Social Security and Medicare, we can make small changes now or big changes later. That is why President Clinton was right when he said ``save Social Security first.'' It would be irresponsible to enact tax cuts this size before doing anything about Social Security and Medicare. Before the Senate passes tax cuts this size, the Finance Committee should report a plan to extend Social Security and Medicare. We should do first things first. That is what this motion requires.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment cuts taxes for 7 of 10 taxpayers who take a standard deduction and ensures that many working Americans would not owe any income taxes at all. It would increase the standard deduction for individuals by $250, and would also increase the standard deduction for heads of households. It would continue to increase the standard deduction for married couples to twice that of an individual. It is paid for by striking the provision in the bill that benefits only taxpayers in the top quarter of the income distribution by expanding tax brackets. 
   My amendment better targets the marriage penalty relief and would simplify taxes and free many from paying income taxes altogether. The tradeoff is clear. Strike the new benefits for the best off quarter of taxpayers to fund benefits for 7 out of 10 taxpayers.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. The vital program known as COBRA helps ensure that people who lose their jobs do not lose their health insurance at the same time. My amendment would expand access to affordable health insurance through COBRA in two ways. First, it would expand COBRA to cover retirees whose employer-sponsored coverage is terminated. 
   Employers who promise retiree coverage and then drop it will have to allow early retirees to have COBRA-continued coverage until they qualify for Medicare. 
   Second, it would create a 25-percent tax credit for COBRA premiums generally. This credit will improve access to and affordability of health insurance for this very vulnerable group. The amendment pays for this health coverage by eliminating an inequitable tax loophole: the percentage depletion allowance for hard rock minerals mined on Federal public lands. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this debate, like the debate on the estate tax that it follows, allows the Senate to talk about priorities. Yes, some sensible reforms are in order to eliminate the marriage penalty for middle-income Americans. But before we enact a major tax bill like this, we should consider whether the first and highest priority for using our surplus should not be extending the life of Social Security and Medicare. 
   Yesterday, the Senate considered the Harkin-Feingold amendment that would have extended the life of Social Security. Some did not like the way that Senator HARKIN and I proposed to extend the life of Social Security. But few will deny that we should do something to keep Social Security and Medicare solvent. 
   As I noted yesterday, starting in 2015, the cost of Social Security benefits is projected to exceed payroll tax revenues. Under current projections, this annual cash deficit will grow so that by 2036, Social Security will pay out a trillion dollars more in benefits than it takes in in payroll taxes. By 2037, the Trust Fund will have consumed all of its assets. 
   Similarly, this year, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is taking in $21 billion more in income than it pays out in Medicare benefits, and its Trustees project that it will continue to do so for 17 years. But by 2025, they project that the Medicare Trust Fund will have consumed all of its assets. 
   We as a Nation have made a promise to workers that Social Security and Medicare will be there for them when they retire. We should start planning for that future. 
   The Social Security Trustees' actuarial report shows a Social Security trust fund shortfall of 1.89 percent of payroll. That is, to maintain solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund for 75 years, we need to take actions equivalent to raising payroll tax receipts by 1.89 percent of payroll or making equivalent cuts in benefits. 
   Thus, we can fix the Social Security program so that it will remain solvent for 75 years if we make changes now in either taxes or benefits equivalent to less than 2 percent of our payroll taxes. But if we wait until 2037, we would need the equivalent of an increase in the payroll tax rate of 5.4 percentage points, to set the program right. The choice is clear: Small changes now or big changes later. That is why Social Security reform is important, and why it is important now. 
   And that's why President Clinton was right when in his 1998 State of the Union Address, he said, ``What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.'' 
   Beginning in 1999, the government began to run surpluses in the non-Social Security budget. If we continue current law and don't dissipate these surpluses, they will continue into the  2020s or beyond, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. But starting in 2015, Social Security will start redeeming the bonds that it holds, and the non-Social Security budget will have to start paying for those bonds from non-Social Security surpluses. The bottom line is that starting in 2015, the government will have to show restraint in the non-Social Security budget so that we can pay the Social Security benefits that people have earned. 
   That is why it doesn't make sense to enact either tax cuts or spending measures that would spend the non-Social Security surplus before we've addressed Social Security and Medicare for the long run. Before we enter into new 
   obligations, we need to make sure that we have the resources to meet the commitments we already have. 
   Indeed, not spending the surplus has a positive benefit for addressing Social Security and Medicare. The government is spending $224 billion this year just to pay the interest on the Federal debt. That is 11.5 cents out of every tax dollar the government collects. If we don't use the surplus for tax cuts or spending, but instead pay down the debt, we reduce that annual interest cost. The President's latest budget proposal calls for paying down the entire publicly-held debt by 2012. Doing so would give us $224 billion a year more in resources than we have now with which to address our Social Security and Medicare obligations. 
   The government is like a family with a mortgage on the house and young kids who will go to college in a few years. One way to prepare to be able to afford those college costs is to pay down the mortgage now. 
   There are a variety of options for extending Social Security's solvency. A broad choice of options exist for how we might get where we need to go. Yesterday, we rejected one option. My motion simply says we should choose some option to extend the life of Social Security and Medicare. 
   The marriage tax bill before us today would head in the opposite direction. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the committee-reported bill would cost $56 billion over the first 5 years. And it would cost about $250 billion, if the sunset provision in this bill is not maintained. 
   This bill is just one in a long series of tax bills. It's no secret. The majority leader has essentially said as much. The majority intends to pass--in one bill after another--a massive tax cut plan reminiscent of the early 1980s. 
   Both the Senate and House have already passed a number of costly tax cut bills this year. According to one estimate by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee made in mid-June, the Senate or the House have already passed tax cuts costing about $440 billion over the next 10 years. Slicing last year's vetoed tax bill into a series of salami slices does not change their irresponsibility. 
   As well, it doesn't make sense to proceed on one expensive part of a legislative agenda before knowing what the others are. Democrats support targeted marriage penalty relief. 
   It would be irresponsible to enact a tax cut of this size before doing anything about Social Security and Medicare. Before the Senate passes major tax cuts like the one pending today, the Finance Committee should consider the options for extending Social Security and Medicare. The Senate should do first things first. And that's all that this motion to recommit requires. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my motion be temporarily set aside.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the bill before us is a major tax bill. Because the bill sunsets in 2004 to comply with the Senate's Byrd Rule, the Joint Committee on Taxation's official estimate is that the bill would cost $55.5 billion. And in the likely circumstance that Congress fails to sunset the bill, it would cost nearly $250 billion over 10 years and $40 billion a year, or $400 billion a decade, when fully phased in. 
   In a matter of this importance, it is appropriate to consider where the money goes. It is appropriate to consider whether we could make other, similar changes to the tax law that would benefit more Americans. 
   This Senator believes that it is a priority to simplify taxes and free people from paying income taxes altogether. My amendment would accomplish both of these goals by expanding the standard deduction. 
   The amendment would increase the standard deduction for individuals by $250, from $4,500 to $4,750. It would increase the standard deduction for heads of households, as well, from $6,650 to $7,500. And it would maintain the underlying bill's policy of increasing the standard deduction for married couples to twice that of an individual. 
   Seven in 10 taxpayers take the standard deduction instead of itemizing. My amendment would benefit all of those 7 out of 10 taxpayers. It would reduce their taxable incomes by hundreds of dollars and thus make it so that many middle-income working Americans would not owe any income taxes at all. 
   Expanding the standard deduction would also make it worthwhile for even more Americans to use that easier method of calculating their tax and avoid the difficult and cumbersome itemization forms. It would thus take one of the most concrete steps that we can take to simplify the unnecessarily complex income tax. 
   My amendment is paid for, so that the total cost of the bill would be exactly the same over 5 years.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to expand access to affordable health insurance through COBRA. It includes a 25 percent tax credit for COBRA premiums, plus an expansion of COBRA to cover retirees whose employer-sponsored coverage is terminated. It pays for this expansion by eliminating a tax break for mining companies. 
   Since 1985, people who lose their jobs have been able to buy into their former employer's health insurance plan. This COBRA coverage has provided some continuity to workers between jobs, but for many Americans, COBRA is an empty promise. 
   That is because under COBRA, people have to pay their own way. But many people who lose their jobs lose any hope of being able to afford health insurance on their own. 
   Mr. President, employer coverage gets a tax break, but individual purchases do not. This amendment would rectify the situation in part by providing a 25 percent tax credit to individual COBRA premiums, giving a little support to people who would otherwise go without health coverage.  
   But COBRA only applies for a brief time, generally eighteen months at most. After that, people must find another source of insurance, or be forced to join the growing legions of uninsured Americans. 
   For older Americans before age 65, there is no other practical source of insurance. Individual plans for people at age 60 can be four times the amount that young Americans could pay. In many parts of the country, the market for individual coverage is not sufficiently developed to provide seniors any affordable health care option. 
   That is why this amendment also extends COBRA for retirees whose employers discontinue their health coverage. Retirees would not lose access to COBRA after eighteen months, but could keep it until they turn 65 and qualify for Medicare. 
   Imagine getting a letter from your former employer one day telling you that the retiree health coverage that you had been promised and that you had been counting on was going to be taken away from you. There would be nothing you could do about it. Only with approval of this amendment would you be guaranteed access to quality health care. 
   To pay for expanding access to health care, this amendment would eliminate from the tax code the percentage depletion allowance for hardrock minerals mined on federal public lands. It retains the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas extracted on public and private land, and also retains this deduction when hardrock minerals are mined on private land. 
   Mineral producers are allowed to deduct a defined percentage of their profits from their income before computing income taxes. There is no restriction in the tax code to limit this deduction to the value of the property, and this deduction is in addition to standard cost depletion for capital equipment such as machinery and vehicles. As a result, companies may over time deduct more than the total value of the property. 
   Today, the percentage depletion rate for most hardrock minerals is 22 percent, while others such as gold, silver, copper and iron ore are depleted at lower rates ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent. 
   On public lands, where mining companies do not pay any return to the taxpayer for the value of the mineral resources they are depleting, and pay a very nominal patenting fee, this policy is very costly to the American taxpayer. 
   So instead of providing this tax break to mining companies, let's instead offer a little help to people who lose their health insurance. 
   Mr. President, 44 million Americans lack basic health insurance. This is a problem that demands attention. Let's build on a law that already works to help people, Americans who have not other health care choice. Let's expand COBRA for retirees to support their transition form work to Medicare. Let's help people afford to keep the health insurance they need. I ask my colleagues to support this sensible amendment. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be temporarily laid aside.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious disappointment with the Fiscal Year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization bill, which passed the Senate earlier this week. I opposed a number of provisions in the bill, including language to restructure and rename the School of Americas. It is this issue which I would like to address today. 
   Mr. President, it is clear that the Department of Defense recognizes there are serious problems with the School of the Americas, otherwise they would not have gone to the trouble of proposing to repackage it. But make no mistake, that is all that has happened. While the name may not remain the same, the School of the Americas still exists. 
   Mr. President, I think a little history is in order here. The School of the Americas was founded in 1946, originally in the U.S.-controlled Panama Canal Zone. At that time, it was known as the Latin American Center-Ground Division. In 1963, the facility was renamed the School of the Americas, and in 1984, in compliance with the Panama Canal Treaty, the school was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia as part of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. 
   SOA was charged with the mission of developing and conducting instruction for the armed forces of Latin America. Unfortunately, what SOA has produced are some of the most notorious dictators and human rights abusers from Latin America including El Salvador death squad leader Roberto D'Abuisson, Panamanian dictator and drug dealer Manuel Noriega, Argentinian dictators Leopold Galtieri and Roberto Viola, and Peruvian dictator Juan Velasco Alvarado. 
   Mr. President, the list continues. SOA alumni include 48 of the 69 Salvadoran military members cited in the U.N. Truth Commission's report on El Salvador for involvement in human rights violations, including 19 of 27 military members implicated in the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests. 
   SOA alumni reportedly also include more than 100 Colombian military officers alleged to be responsible for human rights violations, and several Peruvian military officers linked to the July 1992 killings of nine students and a professor from Peru's La Cantutu University. 
   SOA alumni include several Honduran officers linked to a clandestine military force known as Battalion 316 responsible for disappearances in the early 1980s. 
   And, SOA graduates have led military coups and are responsible for massacres of hundreds of people, including the Uraba massacre in Colombia, the El Mozote massacre of 900 civilians in El Salvador, the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, the torture and murder of a UN worker, and hundreds of other human rights abuses. 
   Mr. President, it is not merely coincidence that SOA has such an egregious list of alumni. In September, 1996, the Department of Defense made available excerpts from seven Spanish-language training manuals used at SOA and it was revealed that those manuals included instruction in extortion, execution, and torture techniques that the Pentagon conceded were ``clearly objectionable and possibly illegal.'' 
   Even today, the SOA legacy lives on. Just this past January, another SOA graduate, Guatemala Col. Byron Disrael Lima Estrada, was arrested for his involvement in the death of Guatemalan Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi in 1998. As CRS noted, Bishop Gerardi was murdered in April of 1998 just two days after he released a report accusing the Guatemalan military for most of the human rights abuses committed during the country's conflict. 
   Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, while the Department of Defense will ostensibly close the School of the Americas, it is producing a clone in its place. The Department of Defense Authorization bill establishes the Western Hemisphere Institute for Professional Education and Training--an institution that appears in every way to be nothing more than a repackaged School of the Americas. 
   To my knowledge, nothing has been done to ensure that a thorough evaluation of SOA is conducted before this new entity is operational. As SOA Watch has noted, there appears to be no critical assessment of the training, procedures, performance or consequences of the SOA training program this new entity copies. 
   I regret the Pentagon has not taken more meaningful steps to address the horrifying legacy of SOA. I support closing SOA permanently, not merely changing its name. 
   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of legislation introduced by the senior Senator from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN) that would terminate this program. 
   But, Mr. President, even if there were any justification for continuing some portion of the School of the Americas, it should come only after a truly serious and independent review is made of the purpose, mission, curricula, administrative structure, and student selection of the new entity. 
   Given the bloody heritage of SOA, the very least we owe the people of Latin America and the innocent who have been killed is such a review. Unfortunately, that is not what will happen. 
   As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am committed to promoting human rights throughout the world. While it may be appropriate for the United States military to train its colleagues from other nations, it is inexcusable that this training should take place at an institution with a reputation far beyond salvage. In my view, our government cannot continue to support the existence of a school or a simple repackaging of that school which has so many murderers among its alumni. 
   Mr. President, I will be watching this new institution very closely, and so, I have no doubt, will many of my constituents. My concerns about accountability and transparency have not been sufficiently addressed, and I will continue to raise this issue until I am satisfied that the U.S. Government has finally and firmly brought an end to the shameful legacy of the School of Americas.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we on this side of the aisle have made clear, this debate is about priorities. The majority has made clear that its highest priority is to expand tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. 
   Yes some sensible reforms are in order to the estate tax, and the Democratic alternative, which our amendment incorporates, would make those. 
   But shouldn't our first and highest priority for using our surplus be extending the life of Social Security? Our amendment would do that, as well. 
   Thirdly, our amendment would make much-needed improvements in Social Security benefits for widows and those who take time out of the workforce to raise their children. 
   As President Kennedy said in his 1962 state of the Union address, ``[T]he time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining,'' This year, the Social Security Trust Fund is taking in nearly $100 billion more in payroll tax revenues that it pays out in Social Security benefits, building up assets. It will continue to do so for pretty much the entire decade. 
   But then, in the next decade, as the baby boom generation begins to retire in numbers, that cash surplus will shrink. Starting in 2015, the cost of Social Security benefits is projected to exceed payroll tax revenues. Under current projections, this annual cash deficit will grow so that by 2036, Social Security will pay out a trillion dollars more in benefits that it takes in in payroll taxes. By 2037, the Trust Fund will have consumed all of its assets. 
   We as a Nation have made a promise to workers that Social Security will be there for them when they retire. Our Nation's commitment to Social Security will not go away. We should start planning for that future. 
   The Social Security Trustees released their last annual actuarial report at the end of March. That report indicated that to maintain solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund for 75 years, we need to take actions equivalent to raising payroll tax receipts by 1.89 percent of payroll or making equivalent cuts in benefits. In 2037, annual Social Security tax revenues will be sufficient to cover 72 percent of annual expenditures. 
   The Trustees' report sounds a warning: We can fix the Social Security program so that it will remain solvent for 75 years if we make changes now in either taxes or benefits equivalent to less than 2 percent of our payroll taxes. But if we wait until 2037, we would need the equivalent of a 28 percent cut in benefits to set the program right. Put another way, if we wait until the trust funds run out of assets in 2037, we will need to make changes equal to an increase in the payroll tax rate of 5.4 percentage points, to set the program right. 
   The choice is clear: Small changes now or big changes later. That's why Social Security reform is important, and why it is important now. 
   And that's why President Clinton was right when in his 1998 State of the Union Address, he said, ``What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple four-word answer; Save Social Security first.'' 
   That's why it doesn't make sense to enact either tax cuts or spending measures that would spend the non-Social Security surplus before we've addressed Social Security for the long run. Before we enter into new obligations, we need to make sure that we have the resources to meet the commitments we already have. 
   The complete repeal of the estate tax before us today would head in the opposite direction. It could cost $750 billion a decade, when it if fully phased in. These costs would begin to hit most heavily in the decade after 2011, just when the baby boom generation will begin to retire in large numbers, just when the financial pressures on Social Security will begin to mount. 
   It would be irresponsible to enact a tax cut of this size before doing anything about Social Security. Before the Senate passes major tax cuts like the one pending today, the Senate should do first things first. And that's what this amendment does. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Illinois. I am delighted to be part of this effort, as three States in the Midwest link together to fight for this long-term care issue. 
   As the Senator from Illinois indicated, this debate all day and throughout this week has been about priorities. 
   By moving this bill, the majority has made clear that its highest priority is to grant tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent of the population. But there are other priorities that I think are more important than that. 
   Yes, some sensible reforms are in order to the estate tax for middle-income Americans and to address the special needs of small businesses and farmers. But we can do that and, by cutting back on the Republican plans tax cuts for the very wealthiest, still have money left over for other pressing needs. 
   One of our Nation's most pressing unmet needs is the acute and growing demand for help with long-term care. As our country's population ages and as Americans live longer lives, we face a major long-term care challenge in the decades to come. And I do not think we are meeting it as a country. I think we talk about Medicare, we talk about Social Security--and those are critical--but this is really the third major piece that we are not adequately addressing. 
   Today, one in eight Americans are over the age of 65. By 2030, one in five will be. 
   Today, 4 million Americans are over 85 years old. By 2030, more than twice as many--9 million Americans--will be. 
   And already today, 54 million Americans--one in five--live with some kind of disability. One in ten copes with a severe disability. 
   The job of helping people with disabilities to deal the life falls heavily on the family. Four out of five primary helpers are relatives, and nearly half of these primary helpers live with the person with a disability. 
   And the burden on the family is not just emotional, but also financial. More than three-quarters of Americans age 22 to 64 with disabilities receive no public assistance. 
   The fact is, our Nation has no comprehensive long-term care system. Rather, patients and their families struggle through a fragmented, uncoordinated, and costly labyrinth. 
   Millions of vulnerable Americans cannot get the care they need. They cannot afford it, they do not qualify for the limited public funding available, or they simply cannot find the services they need. 
   Whenever people have a choice, they would rather get the long-term care they need in their own homes. If they can't get care at home, people want care as much like home as possible, in places like assisted living facilities. Nearly 4 out of 5 older Americans who need long-term care live in the community, and most receive no paid services. 
   This amendment would take one small, concrete step to help them out. Much more than this step is needed. But let us at least take this step. I urge my Colleagues to support the amendment. 
   What the Bayh-Durbin-Feingold amendment and the other cosponsors are trying to do and say is that instead of having this very narrow priority for the very wealthiest Americans, what we have to do is address a true crisis that will only get worse and to do something to assist people with these very difficult costs. 
   I thank the Senator from Indiana for the time and especially for his leadership on this issue.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It limits the estate tax repeal for estates over $100 million. 
   As I mentioned earlier on the floor, this debate is about priorities. In particular, it is a debate about where we should devote our resources. This amendment provides a clear, easily definable choice. 
   Many Members have indicated that reforming the estate tax, especially for small businesses and farms, should be a priority of the body. I am sympathetic to that goal. Let's face it, Mr. President. This bill goes much further than addressing that targeted concern. As it rests now, the bill leaps far beyond any commonsense definition of modest estates and provides massive tax relief to the extremely wealthy, even to multimillionaires. 
   How can anyone suggest that providing such massive tax relief to multimillionaires should be among our highest priorities? They seem to be doing very well. There are millions of Americans who have more pressing needs. 
   Fiscal prudence dictates that we exercise restraint in considering the disposition of projected budget surpluses. First and foremost, of course, these surpluses may never materialize. But even granting or assuming they do, there are many competing needs for this limited pot of money. Providing a massive tax cut to estates of over $100 million is not the best, highest use of the projected surplus. 
   When we increase spending, we are implementing policies that benefit some while increasing the fiscal burden on everyone else. We are engaged, of course, in a zero sum enterprise. There is limited money. Milton Friedman's famous quote is: Of course, there is no free lunch. This is true of tax cuts as well. 
   Every time we lower our tax rate or create a new tax loophole, the tax burden on everyone else increases. Specific tax cuts or spending increases come with a price. They come at the expense of other tax cuts or spending increases or they come at the expense of a higher national debt. 
   Way too often, as we do our work, the choices we weigh are heartbreakingly difficult. They truly are. This is not one of those cases though. It may make some sense to increase the current exemption on estates, but it makes no sense at all to repeal the estate tax for the handful of estates over $100 million. 
   Mr. President, surely the supporters of estate tax cuts must agree that eliminating the estate tax on the handful of estates of over $100 million is not our highest priority, or anywhere close to it. It is not even in the ballpark. When I first ran for the Senate back in 1992, the central issue of my campaign was reducing and, hopefully, eliminating the Federal budget deficit --the result of a decade-long binge of self-indulgent fiscal policies. When I came into office, the deficit stood at about $340 billion. Today, we hope to have a balanced budget for the second year in a row. That, of course, is a remarkable achievement. It came, in large part, because of the tough choices we made in 1993 and, to a lesser extent, in 1997. Nobody can credibly argue that our greatly improved budget position, as well as the sustained economic growth we have experienced, are not, in part, the result of the tough choices we made. 
   I think it would be tragic if Congress now squandered all that has been achieved to appease a handful of enormously wealthy interests--interests, it should be noted, that have been the greatest beneficiaries of our strong economy and, thus, of the fiscal responsibility shown in 1993. 
   This last point bears some emphasis because so often the tax cuts we have seen proposed by the majority have the immediate effect of benefiting the very well off in our society, while in fact the policy that most benefits the well-to-do is fiscal restraint, not politically appealing tax policies. 
   Let's exercise just a little bit of restraint. It is a very modest proposal that we just cut this thing off at a $100 million estate. I hope my colleagues will consider adopting this amendment. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in listening to the Senator from Oklahoma, you would think I were up here proposing for the first time in American history that we implement an estate tax or that perhaps it was something created in the heart of the 1960s as an extreme, liberal idea, and that finally the Republican majority were going to eliminate it. 
   That isn't the truth at all. The fact is, as I understand it, this kind of tax has been around for about a hundred years. When the Senator from Oklahoma condemns the idea of having some kind of limitation on a tax that has been there for decades and decades, in fact, I voted for it, and I assume the Senator from Oklahoma, on a number of occasions, voted for increasing the exemption. He has not taken the position in the past that it must be completely eliminated; otherwise, it is not worth increasing the exemption. 
   That is all this amendment does. It goes awfully high. My amendment says we are going to completely eliminate the estate tax in estates of up to $100 million. In other words, this gentleman that the Senator from Oklahoma is concerned about leaving the United States, under my proposal, would have the first $100 million of his estate exempted. If he is going to take off after the first $100 million is exempted, I really question his business judgment. He has to leave the United States because somehow he is going to be taxed over $100 million? 
   Let's face it--and I hate to use this term--but when you start talking about over $100 million and having to pay some kind of tax, just as people have always had to pay in this country, the word ``greed'' comes to mind rather than ``business judgment.'' There is no need in the pressure of this society to provide an exemption to the estate tax on over $100 million. It would be absolutely clear. Under my amendment, up to $100 million is still covered. 
   Why in the world can't people at that level at least help us out a little bit? Under current law, they are not getting this break anywhere near this level. But I am suggesting once we hit this extreme level, the real extreme idea here is to have no estate tax at all. That is the point. 
   The question is, What should the exemption level be? I am suggesting there is number up in the stratosphere. It is just absurd to provide this kind of benefit. 
   I would suggest that almost any average American you would ask would say, sure, if somebody is at that level, it is reasonable and fair to say they ought to pay some estate tax. 
   That is all this amendment tries to do. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent, in a moment, to modify my amendment, the Feingold amendment to the estate tax bill. When I make this request, the purpose is to address a concern the Senator from Oklahoma raised about unintended implications of the amendment. The amendment was supposed to be a simple amendment having to do with limiting the estate tax exemption of $100 million. 
   He has raised a legitimate point with regard to an unintended consequence. In the spirit of trying to get to the core of the matter, I ask I be able to modify my amendment. My intent was not to impose an additional capital gains tax on estates of greater than $100 million. My intent was to keep the current law rule that permits a step-up in basis. 
   I hope the Senator from Oklahoma in good faith will understand that that was our purpose and that the amendment could be offered in that spirit. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding the fact that this is not the pending business, that I be allowed to modify my amendment and to send a modification to the desk.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, quite simply, this amendment will terminate the future production of the Navy's Trident II missile. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE, and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. WYDEN. 
   I have made it a priority to seek to eliminate unnecessary Government spending. To the occasional consternation of some in this Chamber and elsewhere, I have come to the floor time and time again to try to scale back or terminate costly Federal programs, many of which have outlived their usefulness. 
   In my view, the Trident II program is just the kind of cold war relic that we can and should eliminate. 
   The Trident II, also called the D-5, is the Navy's submarine-launched ballistic missile. It was designed specifically to be a first-strike strategic missile that would attack targets inside the Soviet Union from waters off the continental United States. 
   By halting further production of the Trident II missile, we would save American taxpayers more than $460 million in fiscal year 2001 alone, and according to the CBO, we would save $2.6 billion over the next 10 years, from 2001 to 2010. 
   The Navy now has in its arsenal 372 Trident II missiles, and has requested funding this year for an additional 12. The legislation currently before this body includes more than $430 million for those additional 12 missiles. 
   It also authorizes an additional $28.8 million for advanced procurement for still more Trident II missiles that the Navy hopes to purchase in future years. 
   Let me be clear. My amendment would halt production of additional Trident II missiles. It does not in any way prevent the Navy from operating or maintaining its current arsenal of 372 Trident II missiles. 
   I would like to take a moment to talk about the Trident II, its predecessor, the Trident I, and the reasons why I believe this Trident II program should be terminated. 
   The Trident II is deployed aboard the Navy's fleet of 18 Ohio-class submarines. Ten of these subs are equipped with Trident II missiles. The oldest eight subs in the fleet are equipped with the older Trident I, or C-4, missile. 
   The Navy is already moving toward downsizing its Trident fleet from 18 to 14 in order to comply with the provisions of the START II treaty. Some observers suggest simply retiring the four oldest Ohio-class submarines in order to achieve that goal. Others support converting those subs, which carry the older Trident I missle, to carry conventional missiles. The CBO estimates that this conversion alone would cost about $3.3 billion over 10 years. 
   That leaves four other submarines that are equipped with the older Trident I missiles. The Navy wants to backfit those four subs to carry newer Trident II missiles. 
   The Navy's current goal is to have 14 submarines with 24 Trident II missiles each, for a total of 336 missiles, with a number of additional missiles for testing purposes. The CBO estimates that a total of 425 missiles would be required to fully arm 14 submarines and have sufficient missiles also for testing. That would mean the purchase of at least 53 more missiles. 
   We already have 372 Trident II missiles--more than enough to fully arm the 10 existing Trident II submarines and to maintain an inventory for testing. So why do we need 12 more? 
   Why do we need to spend the taxpayers' money on advanced procurement to buy even more missiles in future years? 
   And why do we need to backfit the aging remains of the Trident I fleet at all? Ten fully-equipped Trident II submarines are more than capable of being an effective deterrent against the moth-balled Russian submarine fleet and against the ballistic missile aspirations of rogue states, including China and North Korea. 
   And the aging Trident I subs won't outlast the Trident I missiles they currently carry, let alone the additional Trident II missiles the Navy wants to build for them to the tune of about $40 million per missile. 
   The CBO has recommended terminating the further production of the Trident II missile, which would save $2.6 billion over the next 10 years, and retiring all eight of the Trident I submarines, which would save an additional $2.3 billion over the next 10 years, for a total savings of $4.9 billion. 
   I do recognize that there is still a potential threat from rogue states and from independent operators who seek to acquire ballistic missiles and other weapons of mass destruction. I also recognize that our submarine fleet and our arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons still have an important role to pay in warding off these threats. Their role, however, has diminished dramatically from what it was at the time of the cold war. Our missile procurement decisions should really reflect that change and it should reflect the realities of the post-cold-war world. 
   Our existing inventory of 372 Trident II missiles is far superior to any other country on the globe. And each of these missiles contains eight independently targetable nuclear warheads, for a total of 192 warheads per submarine. The 372 missiles currently in the Navy's inventory contain 2,976 warheads. Each warhead packs between 300 to 450 kilotons of explosive power. 
   For a comparison--which is really quite striking--the first atomic bomb that the United States dropped on Hiroshima generated 15 kilotons of force. Let's do the math for just one fully-equipped Trident II submarine. 
   Each warhead can generate up to 450 kilotons of force. Each missile has eight warheads, and each submarine has 24 missiles. That equals 86.4 megatons of force per submarine. That is the equivalent of 5,760 Hiroshimas. Let me say that again: the power of 5,760 Hiroshimas on just one submarine. 
   The Navy currently has 10 such submarines, and they want to backfit another four with these devastating weapons. It is hard to imagine why we need to procure more of these weapons when those we already have could destroy the Earth many times over. 
   And it is especially hard to comprehend why we need more Trident II missiles when we take into account the fact that the Trident II is only one of the several types of ballistic missiles the Department of Defense has in its arsenal. 
   The world is changing. Earlier this year, the Russian Duma ratified the START II treaty, a move that seemed highly unlikely just 1 year ago. And Russia has also ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, something that this body regrettably failed to do last fall. 
   I cannot understand the need for more Trident II missiles at a time when the Governments of the United States and Russia are in negotiations to implement START II and are also discussing a framework for START III. These agreements call for reductions in our nuclear arsenal, not increases. To spend scarce resources on building  more missiles now is short sighted and could seriously undermine our efforts to negotiate further arms reductions with Russia. 
   The debate on the underlying legislation is one about priorities. We should stop spending taxpayer dollars on defense programs that have unfortunately survived the cold war and should instead concentrate on military readiness and better pay and benefits for our men and women in uniform. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support this sensible amendment, which has been endorsed by Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Center for Defense Information, the Peace Action Education Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Council for a Liveable World, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and the 20/20 Vision Education Fund. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to debate this with the Senator from Colorado. I will clear up a couple of factual points before I make a few general statements. 
   First, as I understand it, the question of termination costs will not be a problem that will be absorbed because of this amendment, because any unexpended funds can be used for purposes of the termination costs. I don't think that is a major objection. 
   Secondly, I believe the Senator suggested this would have some impact on missiles already in production. That is not the case. That is not the way our amendment is drafted. That is not what it will do. 
   The most important point is that the Senator from Colorado indicates that these missiles are a key ingredient in our national defense. Let's assume that is the case. The fact is, we already have 372 of these missiles. I believe the burden is on those asking for this additional funding to show that that is not enough. 
   Assuming it is a key ingredient, do we really need more than 372? Do we really need these additional 53 missiles? As I indicated earlier, we have 2,976 warheads based on our current 372 missiles, and that is the equivalent of 25,760 Hiroshimas per submarine. I think the burden is on those wanting to spend this additional money to show that we need a stronger deterrent than that. 
   The Senator from Colorado suggested adverse impacts on deterrence if we don't do these additional 12. After 25,760 Hiroshimas per submarine, we need additional deterrence? I didn't hear a single statement from the Senator from Colorado suggesting exactly what the real adverse impacts are of just not doing these additional missiles. 
   I suggest the money is desperately needed not only in general but, even within the defense budget, for the people who serve our country, their pay, their conditions, their housing, readiness, including that of the National Guard, for example. In my State, the people in the National Guard desperately need these resources, for example, for inventory, for training. They are very strapped. They are now taking a great deal of responsibility for our standing Army. To me, the priorities are wrong. We have more than adequate deterrence with these 372 missiles. 
   I suggest the case has not been made, as it must be, by those who want to make the expenditure for these additional missiles. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I don't know how much more I will debate this. I want to respond to the point about the study and analysis that the Senator from Colorado appears to rely on most exclusively. That analysis was done prior to the time the Russian Duma approved START II. This is an example. It is not looking at the present relationship we have and our goals with regard to Russia and the future negotiations, not only with regard to what is going on now, but with START III. 
   The whole point is that we have to look at current realities, look at what we have--372 missiles--and their capacity, and our goals as to what message we want to send to Russia as we negotiate what is hoped to be a reduction in the nuclear arsenals. I think it is simply not only an unwise expenditure, but also an attitude that does not reflect what we are trying to accomplish with regard to our negotiations with Russia. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as you know, this is one of those days that you actually look forward to when you are running for the Senate. I had an opportunity to be on the floor for virtually the entire debate today concerning the estate tax. It is actually a very welcome debate. But let me be clear. Democrats, as well as Republicans, welcome the opportunity to eliminate the estate tax for middle-income Americans and families who own small businesses and family farms. 
   We, on this side of the aisle, believe that we can completely abolish the estate tax for the overwhelming majority of American families who this tax affects at a fraction of the cost of the Republican proposal. Why is that? It is because, unfortunately, the Republican proposal focuses so much of the revenue that is available on the superwealthy. 
   When Senators give examples, as they have done today, they are often using one kind of example that the Democratic alternative would take care of, but their proposal actually spends great amounts of revenue on people who are actually not in the same position as the families which various Senators have described. 
   For example, the Senator from Montana, Senator BURNS, came out and very appropriately referred to the various Wisconsin farmers, dairy farmers, hog farmers, and feed farmers. He said this was the purpose of the repeal of the estate tax. But the fact is, you don't need to completely repeal the estate tax for everyone in the United States of America in order to take care of the problem of every family farmer in Wisconsin with regard to the estate tax. In fact, most of them don't face an estate tax at all given the exemptions under current law. 
   So this notion that somehow the Democrats are against taking care of the problems of farmers who are land rich and cash poor is simply untrue. It is not the Democratic position. In fact, it is just the opposite. 
   Senator GRAMS of Minnesota comes out and gives the example of the family from Idaho that faces a $3.3 million tax burden on the estate tax. He fails to point out that, under the Conrad-Moynihan proposal, that family would get at least substantial estate tax relief, and, we believe, although we would have to check it, perhaps a complete exemption from the estate tax. So the very example that the Senators from the other side of the aisle have used do not support their point. Those examples would be taken care of, I believe, under the Conrad-Moynihan proposal. 
   It is really a bit of a bait-and-switch approach. You come out and give the very appropriate examples of families who may need some estate tax relief, but the actual proposal spends a great deal of available revenue in this country on folks who, frankly, are not as desperately in need of this kind of relief. 
   This debate is very welcome because it gives us a chance to talk about what is most important. This motion to proceed allows us an opportunity to actually contrast the majority's priorities with those of the American people. This is a thread that has gone through the comments today of many of us on our side of the aisle--Senator DORGAN of North Dakota, to Senator WELLSTONE, to Senator BOXER. They pointed out that this is a great chance to talk about what the priorities are for the American people. 
   That is another thing I imagined I would have a chance to 
   do when I came to the Senate. We like to deal in specific subjects and try to give a little expertise and show that we know something specific. But there are also days when we come out and, say, take this subject and that subject and compare them and see what is the most important thing for the American people. Fortunately, the debate today has allowed that opportunity. 
   By moving to this bill and by trying to pass this bill the way it is written with not just sensible estate tax reform but massive tax cuts for the extremely wealthy, the majority makes clear that it favors tax cuts for the very wealthy above anything else. 
   No, the majority's priorities are not those of working Americans. 
   Let me begin by discussing the estate tax, and why the majority's plan to completely repeal the estate tax is wrong. 
   To begin with, the estate tax affects only the wealthiest property holders. In 1997, only 42,901 estates paid the tax. That is the wealthiest 1.9 percent. People are already exempt from the tax in 98 out of 100 cases. Let me repeat that. Already, under current law, 98 out of 100 cases are completely exempt from the Federal estate tax. 
   This year individual estates up to $675,000 are exempt from taxation, and each spouse in a couple can claim that $675,000 exemption. So a couple can already, under current law, effectively exempt $1.35 million from the tax. To add to that, Congress has already enacted useful expansions of the exemption that have not yet taken effect. 
   By 2006, individual estates up to $1 million will be exempt and, therefore, couples will be able to exempt $2 million in tax. Had those exemptions been in effect in 1997, more than 44 percent of the estates that paid tax--remembering that most of them didn't pay tax in the first place anyway at that point--those still paying tax in 1997 would have been completely exempt. 
   In 1997, Congress also raised the exemption for family farms and small businesses, the ones that the Senators on the other side of the aisle have cited needing relief. In 1997, we raised the exemption for the family farm and small businesses to $1.3 million for an individual and $2.6 million for a couple. Small businesses and farms can also exclude part of the value of real property used in their operations. Those very few businesses and farms that are still subject to tax can pay it in installments over 14 years at below market interest rates. 
   In 1997, Congress went a long way toward making the estate tax less of a burden. Already in 1997, the superwealthy were paying most of the estate tax. The wealthiest 1 in 1,000 with estates larger than $5 million paid half the estate tax that year. That is why the Republican idea--and this is the Republican idea not to cut the estate tax, as they will say when they are giving their example--the Republican idea is to repeal the estate tax completely. That is tilted too heavily to the very wealthy. The Republican estate tax repeal would give the wealthiest 2,400 estates, the ones that now pay half the estate tax, an average tax cut just on the estate tax of $3.4 million each. Remember, we are talking about a situation where 
   98 out of 100 people get zero, nothing, from this estate tax cut. 
   Last month, Forbes magazine estimated that Mr. Bill Gates is personally worth about $60 billion. If, heaven forbid, Mr. and Mrs. Gates were to pass away and the Republican bill was fully in effect, if they otherwise would have paid the same average effective tax rate that the largest estates paid in 1997, then, believe it or not, this bill would give Bill Gates' heirs alone, just for those people in that family inheriting the money, an $8.4 billion tax break; $8.4 billion in revenue that we currently collect would go to this one family. 
   Think of how hard we worked on this Senate floor in bill after bill to find  savings in deficit reductions that would somehow come together to reach that large figure, $8.4 billion. Think of how hard we debated programs and tax cuts that cost much less than $8.4 billion. Is the $8.4 billion tax cut for the family of Bill Gates the highest and best use of whatever budget surplus we may have? That is why Democrats can eliminate the estate tax for the vast majority of estates at a fraction of the cost. 
   As I noted, 44 percent of estates that paid tax in 1997 would have been completely exempt from tax if the exemption were raised to $1 million. Fully 85 percent of the estates would have paid no tax if the exemption had been raised to $2.5 million. 
   Senators CONRAD and MOYNIHAN have been working on a proposal that will eliminate the estate tax for most people for whom it would apply today, and to do so for substantially less cost than the majority's bill. I think the Democratic alternative is a good substitute. We ought to pass it. We ought to send it to the President for his signature. 
   If the majority fails to adopt that reasonable amendment, however, we will have others. One of the reasons I welcome this debate is because I am looking forward to offering an amendment that will try something else, that will simply maintain the estate tax on estates of $20 million or more. We are talking about estates of $20 million. We are certainly no longer talking about upper-middle-income families. We are talking about estates of $20 million. I don't think we are talking anymore about small businesses the way most people understand that term. In 1997, there were only 329 estates in the country that amounted to more than $20 million. But those 329 estates are worth $25 billion. We are talking about estates that average $75 million each. The majority's estate tax bill gives the heirs of estates such as those 329 multimillionaire estates a tax cut that averages $10.5 million each. 
   I am looking forward to this debate to see if the majority can at least keep itself from giving this massive tax cut, averaging $10.5 million each, to the wealthiest 1 in 10,000. We will see. 
   The point of amendments such as these is that an estate tax for the superwealthy does, in fact, serve some important social purposes. Yes, some sensible reforms are in order to increase the exemption to the estate tax for middle-income Americans, and certainly to address the special needs of small businesses and farmers. But the majority's position is too extreme. We live in a time of an increasing concentration of wealth. Last September, the Wall Street Journal reported in 1997 the Nation's wealthiest 10 percent owned 73 percent of the Nation's net worth. That is up from 68 percent in 1983. With the stock 
   market boom of the 1990s, the wealthiest have done very well, indeed. 
   Those who hold this great wealth are in a better position to shoulder some of the costs of our society. An estate tax for the superwealthy makes them help out. It is ironic, just when the very wealthiest are doing as well as they have since the gilded age, the Republicans decide that the very wealthy deserve--and what we most need to do--is another tax break. An estate tax for the superwealthy also serves as a backstop to the income tax, ensuring that some income on which income tax is deferred or avoided is ultimately subject to at least some tax. 
   For example, because the income tax law steps up the basis of per capita gains on the value of a piece of property at the time of inheritance, no one pays income tax on capital gains that an individual built up on property the individual owns at the time of death, and, therefore, the estate tax provides the worthwhile social purpose, I believe, that the superwealthy have to at least make up for some of that. 
   I think there is a worthy point that has been debated a little bit in the last hour. An estate tax for the superwealthy does encourage charitable giving as Senator BOXER from California pointed out. A complete repeal of the estate tax would land a devastating blow on colleges, churches, museums, and other charitable institutions that rely on donors to leave gifts. The majority's repeal of the estate could well reduce charitable gifts and bequests by $6 billion annually. 
   The majority bill would be immensely expensive. The Joint Committee on Taxation projects that the majority bill would cost $105 billion over 10 years. Because the bill is phased in slowly over 10 years, its cost would actually explode even more in the second 10 years. When fully phased in, the bill would cost at least $50 billion a year, or more than $500 billion a decade. In fact, the Treasury Department says the figure would be about $750 billion over the decade. 
   Are tax cuts for the superwealthy the first place that we as a Nation want to spend more than half a trillion or three-quarters of a trillion dollars of the surplus? 
   Yes, it is true; some of the speakers on the other side have said America's economy is still strong. The Nation is enjoying the longest economic expansion in its history. Unemployment is at lowest in three decades, and home ownership is at the highest rate on record at 67 percent. 
   Several causes contributed to the current economic expansion, and it cannot be denied that a key contributor to our booming economy has been the Government's fiscal responsibility since 1993. I am very proud of that, as are many Members. The first tough vote I took was to support the President's deficit reduction plan in 1993. It worked, and it worked very well. 
   This responsible fiscal policy means that the Government has borrowed less from the public than it otherwise would have, and will have paid down $300 billion in publicly-debt held by October of this year. The Government no longer crowds out private borrowers from the credit market. The Government no longer bids up the price of borrowing--that is, interest rates--to finance its huge debt. 
   Because of our fiscal responsibility, interest rates are, so far, lower than they otherwise would be. Because of our fiscal responsibility, millions of American have saved money on their mortgages, car loans, and student loans. Because of our fiscal responsibility, businesses large and small have found it easier to invest and spur yet more new growth. 
   Massive tax cuts like the one before us today I think pose the greatest single threat to that responsible fiscal policy, and to the strong economy to which it has contributed. It is no secret and it has been essentially admitted to by the previous speaker, the Senator from Minnesota: The majority intends to pass--in one bill after another--a massive tax cut plan reminiscent of the early 1980s. 
   The majority leader said as much in a Republican radio address over the recess. After rattling off a series of tax cuts, the majority leader said, ``Put all this together and we call it `First Things First' '' 
   I think it is supremely ironic that the majority leader chose to use those exact words, ``first things first,'' for in so doing, he echoed what President Clinton said in his 1998 State of the Union Address, when he said, ``What should we do with this projected surplus? I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security first.'' 
   That is, after all, what this debate is about: What should come first? 
   As I and other Democrats have said, and demonstrated by our votes, we support estate tax reform for middle-income Americans, small businesses, and family farmers. But as we debate what ``first things'' should come first, shouldn't we remember our commitments to Social Security and Medicare? 
   In the decade of 2011 to 2020, just as the costs of the bill before us today will begin to explode, the baby boom generation will begin to retire in numbers. Social Security's trustees project that, starting in 2015, the cost of Social Security benefits will exceed payroll tax revenues. Under the trustees' projections, this annual cash deficit will continue to grow. By 2037, the Social Security trust fund will have consumed all of its assets. Similarly, by 2025, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will have consumed all of its assets. 
   I almost hesitate to say this, but when I look at the young people in front of me who work so hard for us every day, they are the ones who will not get their Social Security if we are not responsible, if we do not make sure we put first things first. 
   According to the trustees, we can fix the Social Security program so that it will remain solvent for 75 years if we  make changes now in either taxes or benefits equivalent to less than 2 percent of our payroll taxes. But if we wait until 2037, we will need to make changes equal to an increase in the payroll tax rate of 5.4 percentage points. We have a choice of small changes now or big changes later. 
   That is why it makes sense to see to our long-term obligations for Social Security and Medicare before we enact either tax cuts or yes, spending measures that would spend whatever that surplus might be. Before we enter into new obligations, we need to steward the people's resources to meet the commitments we already have. 
   I will tell you, when I think of Social Security, the generations that come after us, that is commitment No. 1. 
   Which is putting first things first: saving Social Security and Medicare or cutting estate taxes for the very rich? 
   As part of updating Medicare for the 21st century, we have to ensure that our elderly have access to lifesaving prescription drugs. Three out of five Medicare beneficiaries make do without dependable prescription drug coverage. We on this side of the aisle believe that it is a priority to create a voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit that is accessible and affordable for all beneficiaries. 
   Which is putting first things first: helping provide needed medications for our elderly or cutting estate taxes for the very wealthy? 
   We on this side of the aisle believe that one of our Nation's most pressing unmet needs is the acute and growing demand for help with long-term care. I have worked on this issue more than any other issue in my 18 years in public office. Our Nation's population is aging: Today, 4 million Americans are over 85 years old. By 2030, more than twice as many--9 million Americans--will be. Already today, 54 million Americans--one in five--live with some kind of disability. One in ten copes with a severe disability. In four out of five cases, a family member serves as that disabled person's primary helper, and, believe me, serves under a heavy burden in doing so. If the majority allows us to offer amendments, I will join with others on this side of the aisle in an amendment that will take some of the money that the majority would use to cut taxes for the superwealthy and use it to help make tax benefits available to these hard-working and financially strapped helpers. 
   Again, which is putting first things first: helping people to provide long-term care for elderly and disabled family members or cutting estate taxes for the very wealthy? 
   It seems that more and more these days, we see legislation like that before us today that benefits the very wealthy. At the same time, Senators feel increasing pressure to raise larger and larger sums of money from wealthy contributors. Observers could be forgiven for linking the two phenomena. Observers could reasonably wonder whether the contact Senators increasingly have with wealthy contributors could perhaps lead Senators increasingly to continually believe that the problems of the very wealthy are the problems to which we must respond first. 
   The problem has only become worse with the large amounts of soft money being raised to get around the campaign finance laws. As the Supreme Court concluded in its decision this January in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC: ``[T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.'' 
   A number of us believe that it continues to be a matter of great urgency to stop this corrupting influence of soft money in our elections. We feel that in order to get our priorities right, we need to get our house in order. Although it was undeniably a good thing to reform disclosure of contributions by organizations that do business under section 527 of the tax code, as we just did, that is by no means enough. Those of us fighting for campaign finance reform will forego no opportunity to offer an amendment to ban corrupting soft money once and for all. 
   On that point, as we all know, only the tiniest fraction of the American people will be affected by this tax legislation before us today. But the American people also understand that those wealthy enough to be subject to estate taxes tend to have great political power. 
   Those wealthy interests are able to make unlimited political contributions, and they are represented in Washington by influential lobbyists that have pushed hard to get this bill to the floor. 
   The estate tax is one of those issues where political money seems to have an impact on the legislative outcome. That is why I want to quickly Call the Bankroll on some of the interests behind this bill, to give my colleagues and the public a sense of the huge amount of money at stake here. I talked about taxes, but now I am talking about political contributions. 
   Take for instance the National Federation of Independent Business. Repeal of the inheritance tax is one of the federation's top priorities, and the federation is considered one of the most powerful organizations in town. 
   They have the might of PAC and soft money contributions behind them. 
   NFIB's PAC has given more than $441,000 in PAC money through June 1 of this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That is on top of the incredible $1.2 million in PAC contributions NFIB doled out during the 1997-1998 election cycle. 
   NFIB has also given soft money during the first 18 months of the current election cycle--just over $30,000 so far. 
   Then there is the Food Marketing Institute, which represents supermarkets, and has also made a powerful push to bring this bill to the floor. 
   Behind that push was the weight of significant PAC and soft money contributions, which I am sure is not a surprise to anybody. 
   Through June 1st of this election cycle, the Food Marketing Institute has given more than $241,000 in PAC donations to candidates, after it made more than a half million in PAC donations during the previous cycle. 
   FMI is also an active soft money donor, with more than $156,000 in soft money to the parties since the beginning of this cycle through June 1st of this year. 
   On top of these wealthy associations, there are countless wealthy individuals who want to see the estate tax repealed. They are that tiny fraction of Americans who would benefit by the difference between the Republican approach and the more modest and appropriate Democratic approach. 
   These folks want an end to the estate tax, and they are also able to give unlimited soft money to the political parties to get their point across. 
   Then there is the most interesting player in the push to repeal the estate tax--the mystery donors. 
   That is right, we don't know who is funding one of the major efforts to end the so-called death tax. 
   We don't know because the group paying for it is one of those secretive 527 groups. 
   The group is called The Committee for New American Leadership, and was founded, I am told, by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The committee, identified in news reports as a 527 ``stealth PAC,'' has been very busy pushing for the repeal of the estate tax, but nobody knows who is footing the bill for those efforts. 
   As I stand here today, these mystery donors are having a lot to say about what gets debated in the Senate, and we have no way of really knowing who they are, or how much they gave. But thankfully, all of that may be changing. 
   Thanks to the passage of the 527 disclosure bill, which the President almost immediately signed into law, from here on in we will know a lot more about who is writing the check to the Committee for New American Leadership, and the donors to every other stealth PAC that hid behind a tax loophole to evade public scrutiny. 
   So, reformers won a victory with passage of the 527 disclosure bill, and we are just getting started. We are going to keep pushing until we address the other gaping loopholes in the campaign finance law that allow wealthy interests spend unlimited amounts of money to push for bills like this one, which serve the interests of the wealthy few at the expense of most Americans. 
   Mr. President, again, to return to the central question, I ask: Which is putting first things first: ensuring honest elections, or cutting estate taxes for the very wealthy?  
   The majority shows by proceeding to this bill that it wants to help out those who have benefitted most in the latest economic boom. But the week before last, the business group the Conference Board released a report that said:  
   Working full-time and year-round is, for more and more Americans, not enough.  
   The report, called ``Does a Rising Tide Lift All Boats?'' finds that Americans holding full-time jobs in the 1990s were just as likely to fall into poverty as Americans working full-time in the 1980s, and more likely to fall into poverty than full-time workers were in the 1970s. As The Wall Street Journal reported, economists attribute the problem in part to the erosion of the value of the minimum wage, which was in today's dollars worth about $7 in 1969, compared with the current minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. 
   We on this side of the aisle believe that it is a priority to enact an increase in the income of working Americans making the minimum wage. The majority appears to believe that a tax cut for the very wealthy should be addressed first. 
   So which is putting first things first: enacting a raise for working people making the minimum wage, or cutting estate taxes for the very wealthy? 
   Even if we chose to confine ourselves strictly to cut taxes, should our highest priority for tax cuts be the very wealthiest 2 percent of the population? The majority shows by proceeding to this bill that it favors tax cuts for the super-wealthy before tax cuts for anyone else. 
   We on this side of the aisle believe that it is a priority to cut taxes for working families struggling to stay out of poverty--families who have some of the highest marginal tax rates in our tax system. The majority's bill would give tax cuts to fewer than 43,000 upper-income taxpayers a year. In contrast, the President's proposal to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to reward work and family would provide tax relief for 7 million working families, providing up to $1,155 in additional tax relief a family. 
   Among other things, the President's EITC proposal would increase benefits for working families with three or more children. The poverty rate for children in these larger families remains a stunning 29 percent, more than double the poverty rate among children in smaller families. A decade ago, a bipartisan group of Wisconsin State legislators enacted a substantially larger State EITC for families with three or more children, and it has helped to lift thousands of Wisconsin families from poverty. 
   Which is putting first things first: helping the kids in 7 million working families keep out of poverty, or cutting estate taxes for the children who stand to inherit from the very wealthy? 
   This Senator believes that it is a priority to simplify taxes and free people from paying income taxes altogether. One way to do this would be to expand the standard deduction. That would reduce tax liability for millions of working Americans. If the majority ever gives us a chance to offer amendments, I intend to offer such an amendment on tax legislation this year. Right now, 7 in 10 taxpayers take the standard deduction instead of itemizing. Expanding the standard deduction would make it worthwhile for even more Americans to use that easier method and avoid the difficult and cumbersome itemization forms. As well, expanding the standard deduction would free millions of middle-income working Americans from having any income tax liability at all. 
   So again, which is putting first things first: freeing millions of middle-income Americans from the income tax, or cutting estate taxes for the very wealthy? 
   Simplifying taxes generally should be a priority. Some have proposed that modest investors in mutual funds should be exempted from filling out the complicated capital gains schedule. Some have suggested streamlining the complicated child credit. Some have proposed further simplifying the Nanny Tax by raising the threshold for filing. These modest steps would relieve millions of middle-income taxpayers from needlessly complex and time-consuming tax forms, but they would also cost money. 
   So which is putting first things first: simplifying income taxes for millions of middle-income taxpayers, or, again, cutting estate taxes for a few hundred of the very wealthy? 
   Senators on both sides of the aisle believe that we should repeal the telephone tax for residential users. Pretty much everyone pays the telephone tax. Mr. President, 94 percent of American households have telephone service. And remember, fewer than 2 percent, even under current law, pay the estate tax. If the majority allows us to offer amendments, I will join with others on this side of the aisle in an amendment that will take some of the money that the majority would use to cut taxes for the super-wealthy and use it to repeal the telephone tax for residential users. 
   Now, the majority also wants to eliminate the telephone tax for businesses, which is just a tax cut for people who own stock in those businesses--not the most progressive of tax cuts--but cutting taxes on residential telephone users is among the more progressive tax cuts that one could imagine this Congress passing. But the schedule betrays the majority's priorities. 
   Which is putting first things first: repealing a residential telephone tax that nearly everyone pays, or repealing estate taxes that only very wealthiest 2 percent pay? 
   Senators on both sides of the aisle believe that it is a priority to help working American families to save. The President's proposal last year to encourage retirement savings through what he called USA Accounts made some sense. Similarly, this year, Vice President GORE's new Retirement Savings Plus accounts--voluntary, tax-free personal savings accounts separate from Social Security but with a Government match--are also a pretty good idea. Both USA Accounts and Retirement Savings Plus would help millions of middle-income Americans to save and build resources for retirement. 
   So again, when you look at that issue, which is putting first thing first: helping working American families to save, or cutting estate taxes for the very wealthy? 
   As I said at the outset, this is really a welcome debate. Because the majority's desire to increase tax breaks for the very wealthy paints so stark a contrast to the many ways by which Senators on this side of the aisle really do want to help working Americans. 
   This is not an example of class warfare. To point out what is going on, that is not what this is at all. In fact, what is class warfare is to maintain taxes on the vast majority of working Americans while cutting taxes only for the very wealthy Americans. 
   I have taken some time on this occasion to contrast the majority's priorities with those of the American people because the majority leader has made all too clear that he does not intend to allow a fair and full debate of this estate tax bill. I have made this case on the motion to proceed rather than waiting for the bill itself because, if the majority leader follows what has become his regular practice, he will, in all likelihood, file cloture on the bill as soon as we get to it. 
   Mr. President, I have said this before at much greater length, but I will say it again--others have said it better--this is not how the Senate was meant to work. This is the place where the Government was intended to consider policies fully and fairly. 
   The majority leader's all-too-rapid resort to cloture deprives Senators from debating priorities such as those I have discussed today, and so many more. That is why I have taken time during this debate on the motion to proceed, which is not where we normally have this sort of debate, to warn, before the majority leader files his cloture motion, against the dangers of invoking cloture on the estate tax bill. 
   This is a major bill. If enacted, it would take more than half a trillion dollars, maybe three-quarters of a trillion dollars a decade that would otherwise have gone to paying down the debt and put it in the hands of the very few wealthiest members of society. It would be neither fitting nor appropriate to effect the transfer of more than half a trillion dollars without a full and fair debate. 
   And that is why we must debate this motion fully today. For if there is a remedy for the majority leader's abuse of the cloture process, it is a more rigorous use of the cloture process when it is abused. 
   New York's Governor Al Smith said in 1933, ``All the ills of democracy can  be cured by more democracy.'' To paraphrase Governor Smith, the cure for not honoring the spirit of the Senate's rules is to honor the Senate's rules to the letter. 
   Thus, if the majority lseader wants all the benefits of the cloture rule, then he will have to bear all the costs of the cloture rule, as well. If the majority leader lays down a cloture motion, he should be prepared to have the full 30 hours of debate on the matter on which the Senate invokes cloture. If the Senate invokes cloture, it should expect to have to remain on the matter on which has invoked cloture. 
   Let's cut to the chase. The majority is moving to this complete repeal of the estate tax at least in part as a purely political gesture. The Administration has stated in so many words that the President would veto this bill. The majority apparently wants the veto and the issue more than it wants a good law that would eliminate estate taxes for the overwhelming majority of those who pay it. 
   Such a compromise is available if the majority is willing to take it. The majority need only adopt Senator CONRAD's and Senator MOYNIHAN's substitute, and we can have meaningful estate tax reform this year. 
   But if the majority does not do so, then we will debate this bill at length and vote on a series of amendments.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Nevada. That kind of encouragement is helpful because it is sometimes a lonely issue. What I have found most effective in talking to people, if you mention the issue of campaign finance reform in general, to use that term, or in the abstract, it is clear to people you are trying to do something that is important. But if you want to make it concrete for them, you have to show the connection between all that money and particular bills coming through here that really don't belong here. This is a great example, the estate tax. The idea that we give this huge tax break to a very few people when there are all these other priorities raises the question in people's minds: Why would elected officials do such a thing? I believe part of the answer is there is just too much money behind this bill.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. All of us who work on the issue with him consider him our commander, in effect. We, of course, are well aware not only of the fact that he worked so hard on this issue for years before his Presidential campaign, but he is also doing a tremendous job of channeling enthusiasm from his campaign into actually getting things done on campaign finance on the floor. That is how the 527s got through. Thanks to my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, about whom we often have to talk in less than positive terms on the campaign finance issue, almost every one of them supported us at least on that issue. We are hoping that will lead to a momentum to actually ban soft money and go beyond that. I thank the Senator from Nevada for his questions. 
   To conclude, we will vote on priorities. We will vote on which is putting first things first: paying down the debt to help Social Security and Medicare or cutting taxes for the super-wealthy. 
   We will afford the majority a number of opportunities to let us know how wealthy one has to be before even the majority considers one superwealthy. As I said earlier, I am looking forward to offering an amendment that would simply maintain the estate tax on estates of $20 million or more, and preserve those funds to pay down the debt to help Social Security and Medicare. 
   But if that amendment should not succeed, then I look forward to offering an amendment that would simply maintain the estate tax on estates of $100 million or more, and preserve those funds to pay down the debt to help Social Security and Medicare. If the majority does not consider estates of $20 million to be the super-wealthy, then perhaps they will agree that those worth $100 million are superwealthy. 
   If that amendment should not succeed, then I could have another that would maintain the estate tax on estates of a billion dollars or more, and preserve those funds to pay down the debt to help Social Security and Medicare. If the majority does not consider estates of $20 million to be the superwealthy, and does not consider estates of $100 million to be superwealthy, then perhaps they will agree that those worth a billion dollars deserve the title ``superwealthy.'' 
   Ironically, some will then charge us on this side of the aisle with holding up the estate tax bill. But it is not we, but the majority who are thwarting the enactment of estate tax relief by clinging to their extreme repeal plan. 
   The choice for the majority is clear: The majority can persist in the political exercise of advancing the extreme bill that we are considering today. Or they can enact fiscally-responsible estate tax reform with overwhelming bipartisan majorities. 
   The opportunity is theirs to take, or to squander.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you. I would like to commend my friend and colleague from Maine for her leadership in passing this amendment that will help improve cardiac arrest survival rates across rural America by making AEDs more accessible. 
   I recently visited DeForest, Wisconsin, where the area's citizens and businesses recently finished a fund-  raising effort that resulted in the purchase of three new defibrillators. When I visited with the DeForest police department, they provided a real life example of why we must increase the availability of defibrillators: since they were purchased just three months ago, two people have been saved by these devices. 
   They helped show me that cardiac arrest victims are in a race against time, and unfortunately, for those in many rural areas, Emergency Medical Services have simply too far to go to reach people in need, and time runs out for victims of cardiac arrest. It is simply not possible to have EMS units next to every farm and small town across the nation. This amendment will begin to address this problem. 
   Just so my colleagues are aware, I would like to ask my friend from Maine to describe how these grants will be made.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the people of Zimbabwe on their participation in the historic elections that took place over the weekend. So often, events in Africa are only mentioned on this floor and in the press only in the event of crisis or tragedy. But only days ago, the people of Zimbabwe seized control of their collective destiny and gave the international community a reason to celebrate rather than lament conditions in Africa. 
   For twenty years, politics in Zimbabwe had been dominated by one party and indeed one man. President Mugabe had the support of all but three members of the 150-seat Parliament. Changes to Zimbabwe's constitution, even when rejected by voters as they were in February, could still be passed through this compliant legislature, enabling the executive to continue to shore up power and ignore the growing chorus of protest from citizens disgusted by corruption and distressed by mismanagement. But this week, the tide turned in Zimbabwe. Without access to the state-run media and without significant financing, opposition candidates still managed to win fifty-eight parliamentary seats and end the ruling party's stranglehold on the state. 
   Mr. President, the world's attention was focused on Zimbabwe over the weekend because of the disturbing events that led up to the balloting. Opposition candidates and supporters have been intimidated, beaten, and even, in more than 25 cases, killed. International assessment teams have indicated that given this violent preface, these elections were not free and fair. 
   But as we acknowledge these flaws, even as we recognize the poisoned environment in which citizens of Zimbabwe were called upon to make their choice, we must also appreciate the courage of the voters and the historic changes they have brought to their country. Zimbabwe is still, without question, a country in crisis. But the people of Zimbabwe themselves have taken a decisive step toward resolving that crisis. In the face of violence and intimidation, a remarkable number of voters chose a peaceful and rule-governed expression of their will, and the power in their statement has fundamentally changed the nature of governance in Zimbabwe and silenced the pessimists who claimed that Zimbabwe was already hopeless and lost. 
   In the wake of these elections, many challenges remain in Zimbabwe. The next round of presidential elections must be conducted in a free, fair, and democratic manner. Genuine, rule-governed land reform must move forward. The economy must be repaired, step by step. Zimbabwe, along with the other African states that have troops in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, must extricate itself from the costly conflict. And perhaps most importantly, government and civil society alike must address the devastating AIDS crisis head-on. 
   International support and assistance will be critical to these efforts. The Zimbabwe Democracy Act, a bill introduced by Senator FRIST and of which I was an original co-sponsor, recognizes both the obvious need for more progress toward democracy and the rule of law in Zimbabwe, and the need for international support. I hope that the conditions laid out in that bill for resumption of a complete program of bilateral assistance will be met expeditiously. And I am glad that, in the meantime, the bill ensures that U.S. assistance will continue to bolster democratic governance and the rule of law, humanitarian efforts, and land reform programs being conducted outside the auspices of the government of Zimbabwe. This bill has passed the Senate, and I hope that the House will pass it soon, as it contains particularly timely provisions which will assist individuals and institutions who accrue costs of penalties in the pursuit of elective office or democratic reforms. 
   So again, I extend my congratulations to the people of Zimbabwe on their historic vote, and I urge my colleagues to take note of the potential for real change and real progress that exists within Zimbabwean society and indeed within many of the countries of Africa. Africa is not a hopeless continent. One cannot paint the entire region in the same depressing and fatalistic shades. And Mr. President, I intend to come to this floor to highlight the promise and the achievements of the diverse region in the remaining weeks of this session, in an effort to counter the lazy, misguided analysis that suggests we should wash our hands of engagement with this remarkable part of the world.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator GRASSLEY in introducing the Medicare Home Health Refinement Act of 2000. This legislation will provide a measure of financial relief for cost efficient home health agencies that are making the transition from the Interim Payment System to the soon to be implemented Prospective Payment System. 
   Since the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, many cost-effective home health agencies have experienced financial hardship, which has forced agencies to divert funds away from patient care. 
   We must ensure that home health care agencies can continue to provide their invaluable service to the elderly and the disabled. 
   As I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties each year, I have heard countless stories from home health agencies that a number of burdensome new regulations imposed by the Health Care Financing Administration have hindered their ability to do what they do best--provide quality care. 
   Our legislation addresses many of these concerns. In fact, a number of the provisions come directly from the providers in Wisconsin. 
   Our bill offers a combination of emergency cash flow assistance, reimbursement for transition costs, and a system to separate medical supply costs from other home health expenses as home health agencies switch to a new payment system. 
   Home health care provides compassionate, at-home care to seniors and people with disabilities in cities and towns throughout Wisconsin. Without it, many patients have no choice but to go to a nursing home, or even an emergency room, to get the care they need. For too many home health patients in Wisconsin, that day has arrived. 
   Home health agencies around my state have closed their doors due to massive changes in Medicare, and seniors and the disabled have been forced to go elsewhere for care.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, despite the claims in the press by some opponents of this measure, this bill is fair and evenhanded. It affects groups on both sides of the political spectrum. It is not aimed at any particular group or players in the elections. It is aimed at getting rid of secrecy. It is not an attempt to silence anyone. It is an attempt to give the American people information. They are entitled to have this information about the groups who flood the airwaves with negative ads during an election campaign. 
   I thank all my colleagues who supported the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman amendment on the Department of Defense bill. They can be proud of what they did. With that vote, they have started in motion a process that has brought us to this day, when we will quickly pass and send to the President for his signature a good, fair, bipartisan bill that does the right thing for the American people.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to describe why I opposed the amendment offered by the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, to this legislation on the issue of schools and libraries blocking children's access to certain materials on the Internet, and supported the alternative amendment on this topic offered by Senator SANTORUM. 
   The McCain amendment prohibits schools and libraries from receiving federal funds under the E-Rate program if they do not install software to block children's access to two specific kinds of information: materials that are obscene and materials that constitute child pornography. The Santorum amendment contains a similar prohibition on funding, but gives the local community the flexibility to decide what materials are inappropriate for children's viewing and to implement a comprehensive policy on minors' Internet use if they want to continue to receive the E-Rate. I feel that local communities, not the federal government, should decide what materials are suitable for children's viewing. Wisconsin communities may want to address or restrict whether children have access to adult chat rooms even though the chat may not be about child pornography or may not contain technically obscene topics of conversation. They also may want to restrict whether they post identifying information or photographs of students on school sponsored web sites. I simply feel that these decisions are best made locally. 
   Second, I am concerned that the McCain amendment imposes an additional cost to obtain filtering software upon schools and libraries without adequate input from those institutions. The McCain amendment relies upon the technical fix of filtering and imposes filtering software on all computers in a facility. The Santorum amendment allows a school or library to determine which computers are available for student access and then install blocking software upon those computers. Software licensing costs are not inexpensive, and requiring that software be installed on every machine may be financially difficult for small communities. 
   Finally, though I am concerned about protecting children on the Internet, I am also concerned about the constitutionality of blocking material on the Internet for adult computer users. The Santorum amendment allows communities to develop common sense solutions to protect the rights of adults to access information over the Internet in a place like a public library. A Wisconsin community could decide, under the Santorum amendment, for example, that it wanted to have a locked room in its public library with computers in it that only adults could use to access the Internet and not install blocking software on those machines. There are ways to block children's access to computers that are structural, Mr. President, like a locked door, that would still protect the First Amendment right of adults. These options are not available under the McCain amendment. 
   I appreciate the Senate's interest in protecting children from inappropriate material on the Internet, but I feel that the McCain amendment does not go far enough to ensure that local governments, libraries, schools, and individuals rights are protected.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate National Dairy Month, and the wonderful history of our nation's dairy industry. During June Dairy Month we in Wisconsin take a special opportunity to celebrate Wisconsin dairy's proud tradition and heritage of quality. This month provides an opportunity for all Wisconsinites--both those on and off the farm--a special time to reflect on the historical importance, and future of America's dairy industry. 
   This month is especially important to my home state of Wisconsin, America's Dairyland. What many of my colleagues may not know is that Wisconsin became a leader in the dairy industry well before the 1930's when it was officially nicknamed America's Dairyland. It was soon after the first dairy cow came to Wisconsin in the 1800's that we began to take the dairy industry by storm. 
   In fact, before Wisconsin was even a state, Ms. Anne Pickett established Wisconsin's first cheese factory when she combined milk from her cows with milk from her neighbor's cows and made it into cheese. 
   Over the past month, Wisconsinites have recognized this proud tradition by holding over 100 dairy celebrations across our state, including dairy breakfasts, ice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, festivals and other events. 
   These functions help to reinforce the consumer's awareness of the quality variety and great taste of Wisconsin's dairy products and to honor the producers who make it possible. 
   Unfortunately, the picture for producers has not been that bright. Dairy prices for this year's National Dairy Month, along with most of the first half of this year, have reached all times lows. 
   Low milk prices--the lowest since 1978--are wreaking havoc on Wisconsin's rural communities. In addition to these low prices, dairy farmers are also facing month to month price fluctuations of up to 40 percent. 
   What is so troublesome is that farmers are experiencing these low prices while the retail price continues to increase. In fact, thanks to a 20 percent jump last year in the retail price, the farm retail price spread for dairy products has more than doubled since the early 1980s. 
   Because of this concern, earlier this year, Senator LEAHY and I asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a thorough investigation into the increasing disparity between the prices dairy farmers receive for their milk, and the price retail stores charge for milk. 
   In the study, GAO will focus its attention on the impact of market concentration in the retail, milk processing, procurement and handling industries and describe the potential risks of any such concentration for dairy farmers and federal nutrition programs. 
   Specifically, we asked the GAO to identify the factors that are depressing the price farmers receive for their milk, and why this trend has persisted while retail prices continue to rise. After all, this trend defies economic expectations, and frustrates the aspirations of hardworking farmers, with no apparent benefit to consumers. 
   During June Dairy Month, the dairy industry also called for mandatory price reporting for manufactured products. In early June, the sudden discovery of 24 million pounds of butter shined the spotlight on the need for an effective reporting system for storable dairy products . 
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which tracks domestic butter stocks, discovered a new warehouse  that hadn't been reporting its butter inventory. When this huge quantity of butter was finally reported, prices went down sharply, and so did the dairy industry's faith in the reporting system for storable dairy products. 
   Wall Street would never put up with this kind of reporting errors in its markets, and neither should the agriculture industry. 
   Regardless of where the dairy industry chooses to get its information, through the National Agricultural Statistics Service or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, that information must be accurate. These costly mistakes happen because the current reporting system is voluntary, leaving room for serious errors. 
   To address this growing concern, Senator CRAIG and I introduced the Dairy Market Enhancement Act of 2000, which takes the next step toward fair and accurate reporting. It would mandate reporting by dairy product manufacturing plants, would subject that reporting to independent verification, and would require the USDA to ensure compliance with the mandatory reporting and verification requirements. 
   Our bill also would direct the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to conduct a study on the reporting practices at the CME and report its findings to Congress. 
   We must also ensure that America's dairy farmers are put on a level playing field in the world economy. As I travel to each county in Wisconsin, I hear a growing concern over efforts to change the natural cheese standard to allow dry ultra-filtered milk in natural cheese. 
   Our dairy farmers have invested heavily in processes that make the best quality cheese ingredients, and I am concerned about recent efforts to change the law that would penalize them for those efforts by allowing lower quality ingredients to flood the U.S. market. 
   Senator JEFFORDS and I introduced the Quality Cheese Act of 2000 to respond to the call of our nation's dairy farmers. 
   Our legislation would disallow the use of so called ``dry'' ultra-filtered milk--milk protein concentrate and casein--in natural cheese products, and require USDA to consider the impact on the producer before any other changes may be made to the natural cheese standard. 
   I recognize that these efforts are only a step in the right direction. 
   In addition to addressing the increased market concentration, enacting mandatary price reporting, and protecting the natural cheese standard, Congress must also provide America's dairy farmers with a fair and truly national dairy policy and one that puts them all on a level playing field, from coast to coast.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend from Vermont to introduce the Miranda Reaffirmation Act, a bill that repeals two sections of the United States Criminal Code because they directly conflict with the constitutional rule set forth by the United States Supreme court in the 1966 landmark decision of Miranda v. Arizona. 
   This week, nearing the conclusion of a busy term, the United States Supreme Court handed down several very important decisions. In one of the more highly anticipated rulings, Dickerson v. United States, the Court held by a 7-2 majority that the rule announced in Miranda is still the supreme law of this  land. As we are all aware, the Miranda rule instructs all law enforcement officers that prior to an in-custody interrogation they must inform suspects of several important constitutional rights: the right to remain silent, the right to counsel, and the right to have counsel appointed if they cannot afford one. 
   As the Court noted, ``Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warning have become part of our national culture.'' Millions of American children have first learned about their constitutional rights by watching police dramas on television and hearing the famous Miranda warnings given to criminal suspects. 
   Mr. President, the Supreme Court's reaffirmation of the Miranda rule was extremely important. In the Dickerson case, a private legal foundation and a law professor intervened in a criminal case and questioned whether Miranda warnings are constitutionally required. Relying on 18 U.S.C. &#167;3501, they argued that law enforcement officers should not have to inform suspects of their basic constitutional rights before proceeding with in-custody interrogations as long as any confessions obtained were determined to be voluntary. While every administration since the law was passed in 1968 has refused to make this argument, a lower court in the Dickerson case agreed with it. Section 3501 was enacted in 1968, just two years after the original Miranda decision. It was a clear attempt by Congress to overturn the constitutional rule laid down in that case. 
   It is a strange quirk of history that the validity of &#167;3501 and Congress's attempt to overrule Miranda was addressed for the first time by the Supreme Court in the Dickerson case. The reason is that a series of Departments of Justice, under both Republican and Democratic Presidents assumed that the statute was unconstitutional and refused to proceed under it. In Dickerson, the Supreme Court agreed with that view. 
   Writing for a seven justice majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out that ``because of the obvious conflict between our decision in Miranda and &#167;3501 we must address whether Congress has the constitutional authority to thus supercede Miranda.'' Second, the Chief Justice reiterated the established principle that ``Congress may not legislatively supercede our decision[s] interpreting and applying the constitution,'' and he concluded by ruling that ``Miranda announced a constitutional rule that Congress may not supercede legislatively.'' 
   Justice Scalia, in dissent, disagreed vehemently with the majority's analysis. In a somewhat curious declaration of defiance he wrote: ``[U]ntil &#167;3501 is repealed, [I] will continue to apply it in all cases where there has been a sustainable finding that the defendant's confession was voluntary.'' 
   Mr. President, as a result of the Court's unequivocal ruling in Dickerson, we now have a law on the books that the Court has ruled is inconsistent with what the Constitution requires with respect to constitutional in-custody interrogations. That may seem to be a matter of little consequence, but the statement of Justice Scalia that he will continue to apply it in future cases shows that it is not. The bill that we are introducing today eliminates this potential problem by removing the unconstitutional provision from the criminal code. 
   This repeal will accomplish two things. It will bring our criminal code into line with what the Supreme Court has now firmly established as the law of the land, and it will remove from the books an ineffective law that Justice Rehnquist considered ``more difficult than Miranda for law enforcement officers to conform to, and for courts to apply in a consistent manner.'' The prophylactic rule established by Miranda has worked well and stood the test of time. Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and defense attorneys have found that it is a far better way to protect the constitutional rights of those accused of crimes than the ``voluntariness'' standard that was in place before Miranda and that &#167;3501 attempted to keep in place. 
   Mr. President, it is simply not appropriate for the existing criminal code to conflict with what the Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires. It is our duty to act to repeal a provision that the Department of Justice has refused to apply and that the Supreme Court has held, in any event, cannot be enforced. As the ranking member of the Constitution Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am proud to join the ranking member of the full Committee, Senator LEAHY, in offering this straightforward and commonsense measure.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased we have reached an agreement to consider and almost certainly pass H.R. 4762, which passed the House last night by an overwhelming vote of 385-39. Tomorrow will be a historic day. For the first time since 1979,  the Congress is going to pass a campaign finance reform bill. The bill we are going to pass is by no means a solution to all the problems of our campaign finance system, but it is a start--and an important start--because it will close the loophole that was opened at the intersection of the tax laws and election laws that allows unlimited amounts of completely secret contributions to flow into our campaign finance system and influence our elections. 
   I yield 3 minutes to the initial leader on this issue, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. LIEBERMAN.

I don't know how the Senator from Kentucky can make that claim because he doesn't know. No one knows how many 527 organizations there are. They currently don't file any reports whatsoever, so we can't know that. They currently don't even notify the IRS that they exist. That is exactly what this bill will change.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me note that there is no constitutional argument against this bill because these organizations receive a tax exemption. The public is entitled to this information in exchange for the substantial tax benefit these groups receive. I am so pleased this matter will be demonstrated in the courts because this bill is going to actually become law. 
   I would like to use the remaining time to remind my colleagues and the public of the scope of the loophole we are about to get rid of. This has been called the ``mother of all loopholes.'' If left unchecked, literally millions upon millions of dollars originating from foreign governments, foreign companies, and even, theoretically, organized crime could be spent in our elections without a single solitary bit of reporting and accountability--totally secret money in unlimited amounts, and no one would know where the money was coming from. It is hard to imagine anything that would be worse for the health of our democracy. 
   We have a chart here containing, word for word, what is essentially an advertisement by one of these groups. It is as plain as day. This group solicits contributions from extremely wealthy individuals and groups. Contributions, it says, can be given in unlimited amounts. They can be from any source. They are not political contributions and are not a matter of public record. They are not reported to the FEC, to any State agency, or to the IRS. 
   Today, we are wiping out what might be the most important part of this advertisement, that the contributions are not a matter of public record. From now on, these groups will disclose their contribution to the IRS. The public will be able to see where their money is coming from and understand what is behind the message. 
   I do want to mention a number of people who have been central to this effort. Of course, my friend and colleague, Senator MCCAIN, deserves a huge amount of the credit for putting forward our original amendment to the DOD bill and tenaciously continuing to push until it became law. Senators LIEBERMAN and LEVIN developed the original bill on 527s, recognizing the huge threat these stealth PACs posed. Their work over the past few weeks to make sure we finish the job has been extraordinary. 
   Senator SNOWE, who has long been concerned about getting disclosure of phony issue ads run in the last days before an election, was a key supporter, as was Senator SCHUMER and many others. On the House side, Representative SHAYS, who is in the Chamber now, as well as Representatives MEEHAN, HOUGHTON, CASTLE, DOGGETT, and MOORE were crucial to getting the bill passed there, over the strong opposition of the House leadership. I am proud of how we worked in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion to get the bill done and close this loophole. This effort bodes well for the future of campaign finance reform. 
   This is my final point, Mr. President. This is not the end of the fight, as we have said. It is just the beginning. Now that we have cracked the wall of resistance to any reform at all, I think we are ready to move forward on truly cleaning up the corrupt campaign finance system. Now that we have disclosure of the unlimited amounts that are going to outside groups, I think we are ready to address the unlimited contributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals that the soft money loophole permits to be given to the political parties. 
   Mr. President, I should have also mentioned Senator JEFFORDS, who is present in the Chamber, for his help on this issue. 
   I know that many of my colleagues want to clean up this system and are willing to work in good faith to find a way that we can do that. 
   In the few seconds I have remaining, I thank a number of staff for their incredibly hard work and dedication to the campaign finance issue and to this 527 disclosure will. We have not had many wins, and they are the ones responsible for keeping us in this fight. Mark Buse, Ann Choinere, Lloyd Ator of Senator MCCAIN's staff, Laurie Rubenstein of Senator LIEBERMAN's staff, Linda Gustitus with Senator LEVIN, Jane Calderwood and John Richter from Senator SNOWE's staff, Andrea LaRue with Senator DASCHLE, and Bob Schiff of my own staff worked very long hours to make sure that we got to this point, and we appreciate all of their efforts and look forward to future victories together. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to voice my concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in Russia. A decade after the break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia still faces enormous obstacles to becoming a stable and prosperous nation. Russia's GDP is less than half of what it was before the break-up, with much of its population impoverished and uncertain about its future. Russia's medical system is in near collapse, and both life expectancy birthrates have declined sharply. Crime is escalating, and corruption is widespread. 
   This is a scenario that would challenge any government. It will require great leadership to turn things around in order to move Russia towards greater freedom and prosperity. But recent events have made me fearful that, rather than leading Russia forward, President Putin and his government are leading their country back into the regrettable past. 
   The apparently baseless arrest of Vladimir Gusinsky raises new concerns about President Putin's commitment to an independent media, particularly in light of his government's abuse of Radio Liberty journalist Andrey Babitsky in retaliation for critical reporting from Chechnya. The Russian government has not heeded international calls for an independent investigation into reports of escalating human rights abuses allegedly committed by Russian troops against Chechen civilians. The reported harassment by the Putin government against some religious minorities, including pressure placed on a prominent Jewish group, is also extremely troubling. 
   Mr. President, a Russia that is democratic and free and follows the rule of law will be a strong and prosperity country, a source of pride to its people, and an ally respected by all nations. I call on Congress and the Administration to do all that is possible to ensure that President Putin moves his country towards this goal.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of our colleagues in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. ENZI]. 
   I strongly support the efforts of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to promulgate fair and responsible ergonomics standards and regulations. I believe that such standards are instrumental in helping to reduce the occurrence of preventable workplace injuries. 
   More than 600,000 American workers suffer from workplace injuries caused by repetitive motions including typing, heavy lifting, and sewing. These injuries have an impact on every sector of our economy, and are particularly prevalent among women because many of the jobs held predominately by women require repetitive motions or heavy lifting. And these preventable injuries, including the painful and often debilitating carpal tunnel syndrome, cost more than $60 billion annually, $20 billion of which is from workers' compensation costs. 
   I want to say this again, Mr. President, repetitive stress injuries are particularly prevalent among women. 
   According to the Department of Labor, almost 230,000 women miss at least some time at work each year because of ergonomics injuries related to their jobs. To further emphasize the impact that these injuries have on women, let me cite the following statistics from the Department of Labor: 
   In 1997, women experienced 33 percent of all serious workplace injuries that required time off from work; 
   But women experienced 63 percent of all repetitive motion injuries, including 91 percent of injuries cause by repetitive typing or keying and 61 percent from repetitive placing; 
   These injuries include 62 percent of all work-related tendinitis cases and 70 percent of carpal tunnel syndrome cases; and 
   Recuperation from carpal tunnel syndrome, an often debilitating condition, requires an average of 25 days away from work. 
   The proponents of this amendment argue that further study is required before OSHA can promulgate its final ergonomics standard. I disagree. It is clear that more needs to be done to prevent these needless injuries, and that there is already a significant body of research outlining the need for national ergonomics standards from sources including the National Academy of Sciences, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the General Accounting Office. 
   And further proof can be found in the existing ergonomics programs. Companies across the country have reduced the instances of preventable workplace injuries by designing and implementing their own ergonomics programs. In my home state of Wisconsin, the popular maker of children's clothing, OshKosh B'Gosh, redesigned its workstations. This common sense action cut the company's workers' compensation costs by one-third, which resulted in a savings of approximately $2.7 million. 
   Another Wisconsin company, Harley-Davidson, cut workplace ergonomics injuries by more than half after implementing an ergonomics program. 
   An employee of a health care facility in my hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, said the following about the joint efforts between her management and fellow employees to design a program to combat injuries that are all too common among health care workers: 
   Quote--``I am here today to tell OSHA that working in a nursing home is demanding and hazardous work. Those hazards include back injuries as well as problems in the hands, arms, shoulders, and other parts of the body. ..... I am also here to testify that the injuries and pain do not have to be part of the job ..... Together [management and labor] have identified jobs where there are risks of back injuries. After getting input from employees, the employer has selected equipment that has improved the comfort [and] the safety of patients as well as the employees. 
   ..... What we are doing at the [nursing home] is proof that it is possible to prevent injuries with a commitment from management and the involvement of employees. Our injury prevention program is win-win for everybody: Management, labor, the patients, and their families. I urge OSHA to issue an ergonomics rule so that nursing home workers across the country will have the same protection that we have at the health care center.''--End of quote. 
   And there are many other success stories in Wisconsin and around the United States. 
   I commend the efforts of those companies which have proven that responsible ergonomics programs can--and do--prevent injuries resulting from repetitive motions. Unfortunately, not all American workers are protected by ergonomics programs like those I have described. 
   For example, one of my constituents who testified at an ergonomics event in my state has endured three surgeries over a ten year period to repair damage to his spine caused by repetitive motions at his job. In his testimony, this man said, quote--``Pain is my constant companion and I still need pain medication to get through the day. It is an effort just to put my socks on in the morning. I will never be healthy and pain free.''--End of quote. 
   Another one of my constituents described the impact that an injury he sustained at work while lifting a 60-80 pound basket of auto parts has had on his once active lifestyle. Quote--``This pain has limited me in many ways....... I used to teach soccer to kids. Now I can't walk more than half an hour without pain in my legs and spine. I have to prepare myself for fifteen minutes in the morning just to get out of bed.''--End of quote. 
   Mr. President, injuries such as those suffered by my constituents--and indeed by workers in each one of our states--can be prevented through sensible and responsible national ergonomics standards. 
   Repetitive stress injuries are costing American businesses millions of dollars and are costing American workers their health and, in some cases, their mobility. This means that some workers will lose the ability to do certain activities--activities ranging from simple tasks like fastening buttons to more meaningful things including picking up a child or participating in sports. 
   These are real people, Mr. President. They are our constituents, our family, our friends, our neighbors. We should not block a regulation that will help to stop these preventable injuries from forever changing the lives of countless Americans who are working to provide their families and themselves with a decent standard of living. 
   I recognize that some industries and small businesses are concerned about the impact, financial and otherwise, that this proposed standard will have on them. I have written to OSHA on behalf of a number of my constituents to communicate their concerns. I hope that the public comment and hearing phases of this rule-making process have adequately brought these concerns to light. I also hope that OSHA will take these concerns into account as that agency continues the process of finalizing this important rule, taking seriously the concerns of employers who fear the new rule will be too burdensome. We need a new rule that protects workers and is fair to all. 
   Mr. President, repetitive motion injuries can and should be prevented. And I strongly believe that we should have a national standard that affords all workers the same protections from these debilitating injuries. We should not delay these efforts. The health and mobility of countless American workers is at stake. 
   I again urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and allow OSHA to move forward in its efforts to promulgate fair and responsible ergonomics standards. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for working with me to reach agreement on this modification. I thank them for cosponsoring it. I thank Senator FRIST for joining me in offering it. 
   This amendment expresses the sense of Congress that the administration's request for flood recovery in southern Africa, and particularly in the Republic of Mozambique, should be fully funded. 
   Right now the foreign operations bill falls far short of fulfilling the administration's request for flood relief in southern Africa. The floods that took so many lives there, and destroyed so many farms, businesses, schools, and hospitals there, have faded from our television screens. But Mr. President, the terrible destruction of these floods has not receded in Mozambique. On the contrary, the longer Mozambique waits for additional flood relief, the more severe the long-term damage of this disaster will become. In February and March Mozambique was in the news because it was devastated by flooding. But before that Mozambique made headlines with the highest economic growth rate in the world. The people of Mozambique have proven that they are fighters, who worked their way back from a terrible civil war to achieve impressive economic and social progress. But today the people of Mozambique are in a fight that they can't win without the help of their African neighbors, and the help of the United States. 
   It was not long ago that Americans saw dramatic images of daring rescues and remarkable perseverance in Mozambique. Massive rainstorms and furious cyclones inundated the low lands of Mozambique and flooded the rivers that meander through southeastern Africa. The region was ravage by not one, not two, but three cyclones. As we stand here, thousands of miles away on the floor of the Senate, it's hard to comprehend the human cost of this disaster. But these floods claimed the lives of 640 people, and displaced or trapped 491,000 others. Schools, business, and clinics were destroyed, and, in a devastating blow to rescue efforts and to prospects for economic recovery, hundreds of miles of the transportation system were destroyed. 
   The floods washed away roads, contaminated water supplies, and forced whole families onto rooftops--even into trees--for days on end. The people of Mozambique have seen their crops flooded, their homes destroyed, and their loved ones drowned by the worst flooding southern Africa has seen in the last 100 years. Yet, alongside these tragedies, we saw vivid images of hope as fellow African nations rose up to help their neighbors--most notably South Africa with its courageous helicopter pilots, but also Malawi and even tiny Lesotho, which helped to get supplies to those in need as quickly as possible. I was proud of the U.S. involvement in these efforts, and I know that many of my constituents shared that pride. It is my intent, with this amendment, to ensure that the people of southern Africa are not forgotten in this bill. The administration asked for $193 million to assist the flood-ravaged countries of southern Africa. This bill provides for only $25 million. That, Mr. President, is simply not good enough. 
   I urge my colleagues to remember that these floods are particularly tragic because the country most seriously affected by them, Mozambique, has made significant strides toward recovery from its long and brutal civil war. Though the country is still affected by extreme poverty, in recent years Mozambique has enjoyed exceptional rates of economic growth, and while more needs to be done, the country has improved its record with regard to basic human rights. It has been making great strides ever since the end of a civil war that ended in the early 1990's. Up until the flood, Mozambique was registering economic growth at a rate of 10 percent a year. That's an incredible achievement for any nation, Mr. President, and it deserves special recognition as a nation of sub-Saharan Africa, where some of its neighbors have struggled to achieve growth rates a fraction of that size. 
   The people of Mozambique have been working hard for a better future--too hard to see that future swept away by the floodwaters that have already destroyed so much. They need our help. Recovery assistance is critically needed to help the people of Mozambique to hold on to the opportunities that lay before them before the waters rose. The World Bank estimates that the cost of reconstruction in Mozambique alone will be $430 million. The floodwaters washed landmines into new, unmarked locations, and infectious diseases spread quickly in the wake of the disaster. In Mozambique, forecasts suggest that the floods have led to grain production shortfalls of more than 15 percent. And the outlook for the future could be even worse if we don't act. Without repaired roads, farmers and small businesses will be unable to function. Without working railroad lines, lost revenues will total an estimated $35 million per year. And without working hospitals and sanitation facilities, Mozambique will suffer further outbreaks of disease. If we don't reach out to help Mozambique now, it won't be long until were read about this nation again in headlines, as the people of Mozambique suffer the consequences of these floods alone without help, Mozambique may never be able to regain its footing on the road to stability and prosperity. 
   I am pleased that both Senators LEAHY and MCCONNELL intend to work to address this issue in conference. I thank them for their cosponsorship, their attention to this, and their assistance with this amendment. 
   Mr. President, it is my understanding that the managers intend to accept this amendment. With that understanding, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Nation has been engaged in a raging debate in recent days on whether Gary Graham should be executed in Texas. 
   Supporters of the death penalty, including Governor Bush, have said there is no conclusive proof that Texas or any State has killed an innocent person. But apparently Gary Graham, who had the courthouse doors slammed shut on his claim of innocence, won't have a chance to prove that he is innocent. 
   I understand, at this moment, that all appeals have now been denied. 
   Mr. Graham is scheduled to be executed before midnight tonight. 
   Mr. President, Mr. Graham's plight symbolizes some of the most serious concerns with the fairness and accuracy in the administration of the death penalty. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Graham is not a good guy. He is a criminal, and, in fact, a very serious offender who deserves very serious punishment. 
   But we need to realize what is about to happen. He is still a human being who is about to be executed at the hands of the State of Texas. This is a capital matter. 
   Mr. Graham may not have committed a murder for which he is about to be executed. This case raised very serious issues of woefully incompetent trial counsel, eyewitness testimony that has never been heard by a jury, a conviction based on the sole testimony of just one eyewitness, and exculpatory ballistic testing data that was not shown to the jury. 
   Despite the claims of those who would support the death penalty, Gary Graham is not alone. There are other examples of people--in places like Virginia, Florida and even Texas--who have been put to death in the face of grave doubt about their guilt. We don't have absolute proof of their innocence. But some day soon, if we continue to let this system run amok, there will be a case where an irrefutably innocent person is executed. 
   One Governor got it right. Governor Ryan of Illinois called a halt to executions in his State and appointed a blue ribbon commission to study whether the system could be fixed. Some say, I think essentially with no basis, that, yes, that was the right thing to do in Illinois but that Illinois is an aberration. Mr. President, I don't believe for a minute that Illinois is an aberration when it comes to the problems with the administration of the death penalty in this country. Governor Ryan was right when he said that he wanted absolute certainty that the person scheduled to die is guilty. The same certainty should apply to the State of Texas this very evening. 
   A recent study by Columbia University documented that 52 percent of death penalty cases in Texas were overturned on appeal during the time period for which the study was done. Nationwide, the Columbia study found an average reversal rate of nearly 7 out of 10 capital cases. 
   What does the Governor of Texas say? He says he is certain that every single one of the over 100 people executed under his watch as Governor was guilty. I have heard him say this many times. He only considers two factors: Whether the person is guilty, and whether he or she had full access to the courts. 
   This is a matter of life and death. They found out in Illinois that it is not that simple. It is not just whether the person is guilty and whether they had full access to the courts. I have no doubt that the intense media and public scrutiny of Texas and Governor Bush's leadership is warranted in this case. The same kind of problems are arising in Texas that were discovered in Illinois and that forced Governor Ryan to take the action he did. In Illinois, it was not the criminal justice system that discovered its defects, it was undergraduate journalism students at Northwestern University who uncovered some of the cases of actual innocence. One person was on death row 2 days from his execution and ultimately the students were able to prove he was actually innocent. 
   The Chicago Tribune, a newspaper in Illinois, was responsible for some of the other proof of innocent individuals on death row, some 13 in Illinois. It was college students. It was the press. They were parties outside the criminal justice system who had to point out the defects in the system. 
   Now the same thing is happening in Texas tonight. The discussion should not end with media attention to this case. In fact, I was appalled this morning. I watch the Today Show every morning as I am getting up and reading the Washington Post. I felt 
   I was watching the trial of a human being, a person who was about to be put to death, on a national television show in a brief segment between advertisements. This cannot be the way we administer justice in this country. In fact, I am very concerned about the way in which this is becoming almost a sideshow, somehow connected with the Presidential election. 
   In fairness to the Governor of Texas and in fairness to Vice President AL GORE, this should not be on their head as the Presidential election goes forward. They should not be put in the position of having to make these decisions as this country comes to the conclusion as to who will be the next President. It is a very unseemly environment in which to decide whether people should live or die. We have a special problem, and it happens that the State with the most executions occurring, the State with many of the  executions coming up, happens to be the State of the presumptive Republican nominee for President. 
   It is a very uncomfortable situation when at the same time all of these questions about the death penalty are being raised. No one can say that this was somehow a partisan attempt to raise the issue because the person who really got this issue going, who really raised the question, is the Governor of Illinois, the chairman of Governor George Bush's campaign in Illinois. 
   I plead that we get this issue away from the Presidential election. The only way we can do that is to have a credible and honest review of the fairness and justice in the system by which our Nation imposes the sentence of death. We should do exactly what Governor Ryan did in Illinois throughout this country: have a moratorium, a pause, during which a blue ribbon panel of pro and anti-death penalty people and other experts examine the issue. 
   We need a temporary halt to executions throughout America. Support for this is growing. California, more than any other State, including Texas, has the most inmates sitting on death row awaiting execution. In a poll of California residents released just today, almost two-thirds of Californians continue to support the use of capital punishment. But by a margin of nearly 4-1, the poll found that Californians favor a halt to executions while the death penalty is studied. I think that is very interesting. The vast majority still support the death penalty, but they do know that something is wrong and we need a pause. 
   I urge my colleagues to lead the American people and join me as cosponsors of legislation that would put a temporary halt to executions and establish the National Commission on the Death Penalty, the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act. 
   This rush to judgment concerning Gary Graham is not in keeping with American traditions and values of fairness and justice. I ask my colleagues to join in urging a pause before an innocent person is executed. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again introduce a bill to deal with the all too common problem of interference with residential home electronic equipment caused by unlawful use of citizens band, or CB, radios. This is the third Congress in which I have offered this legislation. In 1998, it was nearly enacted as part of an anti-slamming bill. I hope that this year, we can finally put this common sense bill into law. 
   The problem of CB radio interference can be extremely distressing for residents who cannot have a telephone conversation, watch television, or listen to the radio without being interrupted by a neighbor's illegal use of a CB radio. Unfortunately, under the current law, those residents have little recourse. The bill I am introducing today will provide those residents with a practical solution to this problem. 
   Until recently, the FCC enforced its rules outlining what equipment may or may not be used for CB radio transmissions, how long transmissions may be broadcast, what channels may be used, as well as many other technical requirements. The FCC also used to investigate neighbor's complaints that a CB radio enthusiast's transmissions interfered with their use of home electronic and telephone equipment. The FCC receives thousands of such complaints annually. 
   For the past five years, I have worked on behalf of constituents bothered by persistent interference of nearby CB radio transmissions, in some cases caused by unlawful use of radio equipment. In each case, the constituents have sought my help in securing an FCC investigation of the complaint. And in each case, the FCC indicated that due to a lack of resources, they no longer investigate radio frequency interference complaints. Instead of investigation and enforcement, the FCC only provides self-help information which the consumer may use to limit the interference on their own. 
   This situation is understandable given the rising number of complaints for things like slamming. The resources of the FCC are limited, and there is only so much they can do to address complaints of radio interference. 
   Nonetheless, this problem is extremely annoying and frustrating to those who experience radio interference. Many residents implement the self-help measures recommended by FCC such as installing filtering devices to prevent the unwanted interference, working with their telephone company, or attempting to work with the neighbor they believe is causing the interference. In many cases these self-help measures are effective. 
   However, in some cases filters and other technical solutions fail to solve the problem because the interference is caused by the unlawful use of CB radio equipment such as unauthorized linear amplifiers. 
   Municipal residents, after being denied an investigation or enforcement from the FCC, frequently contact their city or town government and ask them to police the interference. However, the Communications Act of 1934 provides exclusive authority to the Federal Government for the regulation of radio. This preempts municipal ordinances or State laws that regulate radio frequency interference caused by unlawful use of CB radio equipment. This situation creates an interesting dilemma for municipal governments. They can neither pass their own ordinances to control CB radio interference, nor can they rely on the agency with exclusive jurisdiction over interference to enforce the very Federal law which preempts them. 
   Let me give an example of the kind of frustrations people have experienced in attempting to deal with these problems. Shannon Ladwig, a resident of Beloit, WI is fighting to end CB interference with her home electronic equipment that has plagued her family for many years. Shannon worked within the existing system by asking for an FCC investigation, installing filtering equipment on her telephone, attempting to work with the neighbor causing the interference, and so on. Nothing has been effective. 
   Here are some of the annoyances Shannon has experienced. Her answering machine picks up calls for which there is no audible ring, and at times records ghost messages. Often, she cannot get a dial tone when she or her family members wish to place an outgoing call. During telephone conversations, the content of the nearby CB transmission can frequently be heard and on occasion, her phone conversations are inexplicably cut off. Ms. Ladwig's TV transmits audio from the CB transmission rather than the television program her family is watching. Shannon never knows if the TV program she taped with her VCR will actually record the intended program or whether it will contain profanity from nearby CB radio conversation. 
   Shannon did everything she could to solve the problem and years later she still feels like a prisoner in her home, unable to escape the broadcasting whims of a CB operator using illegal equipment with impunity. Shannon even went to her city council to demand action. The Beloit City Council responded by passing an ordinance allowing local law enforcement to enforce FCC regulations--an ordinance the council knows is 
   preempted by Federal law. The bill I am introducing today would allow Beloit's ordinance to stand. 
   The problems experienced by Beloit residents are by no means isolated incidents. I have received very similar complaints from at least 10 other Wisconsin communities in the last several years in which whole neighborhoods are experiencing persistent radio frequency interference. Since I have begun working on this issue, my staff has also been contacted by a number of other congressional offices who are also looking for a solution to the problem of radio frequency interference in their States or districts caused by unlawful CB use. The city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, in particular, has contacted me about this legislation because they face a persistent interference problem very similar to that in Beloit. I am pleased that Senators LEVIN and ABRAHAM join me today in cosponsoring this legislation. 
   In all, the FCC receives more than 30,000 radio frequency interference complaints annually--most of which are caused by CB radios. Unfortunately, the FCC no longer has the staff, resources, or the field capability to investigate these complaints and localities are blocked from exercising any jurisdiction to provide relief to their residents. 
   My bill resolves this Catch-22, by allowing states and localities to enforce statutes or ordinances prohibiting selected violations of the FCC regulations. This gives local law enforcement the ability to enforce existing FCC regulations regarding unauthorized CB equipment and frequencies while maintaining exclusive Federal jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services. It is a commonsense solution to a very frustrating and real problem which cannot be addressed under existing law. Residents should not be held hostage to a Federal law which purports to protect them but cannot be enforced. 
   Now this amendment is by no means a panacea for the problem of radio frequency interference. It is intended only to help localities solve the most egregious and persistent problems of interference--those caused by unauthorized use of CB radio equipment and frequencies. In cases where interference is caused by the legal and licensed operation of any radio service, residents will need to resolve the interference using the FCC self-help measures that I mentioned earlier. 
   In many cases, interference can result from inadequate home electronic equipment immunity from radio frequency interference. Those problems can only be resolved by installing filtering equipment and by improving the  manufacturing standards of home telecommunications equipment. 
   The electronic equipment manufacturing industry, represented by the Telecommunications Industry Association and the Electronics Industry Association, working with the Federal Communications Commission, has adopted voluntary standards to improve the immunity of telephones from interference. Those standards were adopted by the American National Standards Institute last year. Manufacturers of electronic equipment should be encouraged to adopt these new ANSI standards. Consumers have a right to expect that the telephones they purchase will operate as expected without excessive levels of interference from legal radio transmissions. Of course, Mr. President, these standards assume legal operation of radio equipment and cannot protect residents from interference from illegal operation of CB equipment. 
   This bill also does not address interference caused by other radio services, such as commercial stations or amateur stations. I have worked with the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), an organization representing amateur radio operators, frequently referred to as ``ham'' operators, to address a number of concerns that they raised about the original versions of my bill. ARRL was concerned that while the bill was intended to cover only illegal use of CB equipment, FCC-licensed amateur radio operators might inadvertently be targeted and prosecuted by local government and law enforcement. ARRL also expressed concern that local law enforcement might not have the technical abilities to distinguish between ham stations and CB stations and might not be able to determine what CB equipment was FCC-authorized and what equipment is illegal. 
   I have worked with the ARRL and amateur operators from Wisconsin to address these concerns. As a result of those discussions, this amendment incorporates a number of provisions suggested by the league. First, the amendment makes clear that the limited authority provided to localities in no way diminishes or affects the FCC's exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of radio. 
   Second, the amendment clarifies that possession of a FCC license to operate a radio service for the operation at issue, such as an amateur station, is a complete protection against any local government action authorized by this amendment. Unlike CB operators, amateur radio enthusiasts are not only individually licensed by the FCC but they also self-regulate. The ARRL is very involved in resolving interference concerns both among their own members and between ham operators and residents experiencing problems. 
   Third, the bill also provides for a FCC appeal process by any radio operator who is adversely affected by a local government action under this amendment. The FCC will make determinations as to whether the locality acted properly within the limited jursidiction this legislation provides and the FCC will have the power to reverse the action if they acted improperly. And fourth, my legislation requires the FCC to provide States and localities with technical guidance on how to determine whether a CB operator is acting within the law. 
   In addition, the bill has been modified to address concerns raised by truckers, who feared that local law enforcement would use reports of CB interference to indiscriminately stop and search trucks in the area. The bill now provides specifically that local governments may not seek to enforce the FCC regulations with respect to a CB radio on board a commercial motor vehicle unless there is probable cause to believe that someone in the vehicle is operating a CB radio in violation of the regulations. This provision should ensure that this new authority is not used as a pretext to harass truckers. 
   Again, Mr. President, my bill is narrowly targeted to resolve persistent interference with home electronic equipment caused by illegal CB operation. Under my bill, localities cannot establish their own regulations on CB use outside of the already existing FCC regulations. This bill will not resolve all interference problems and it is not intended to do so. Some interference problems require continued attentions from the FCC, the telecommunications manufacturing industry, and radio service operators. This bill merely provides localities with the tools they need to protect their residents while preserving the FCC's exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious concerns about the foreign operations bill that is before us. I am concerned, and I believe that many of my colleagues will be concerned, about what is in this bill. And I am even more concerned about what is not in it. 
   What is here in this bill, is an extremely expensive package of support to the Colombian military, designated, of course, as emergency spending. I recognize that Colombia is a country in crisis. I believe that it is in the national interest of the United States to help Colombia emerge from that crisis and into an era in which basic human rights and the rule of law are firmly entrenched in the fabric of Colombian society. 
   I recognize that we all share an interest in fighting the terrible impact that illegal drugs have on our own society and in our own communities. So I have made a very serious effort to evaluate this initiative over a number of months. I have heard the perspectives of my constituents, of the business community, of human rights activists, and of the administration. I have also heard from Colombian civic groups and labor unions and from the Colombian government itself. In the end, I remain deeply skeptical about the wisdom of this undertaking. 
   My primary concerns about the proposed package of assistance to Colombia are two-fold. First, I am concerned about the degree to which this package involves the United States in a counter-insurgency campaign in Colombia. The aim of our assistance to the Colombian military would be to combat narcotics traffickers, I have no doubt--but its primary use would be to wage war against the rebels who control the south. Our country's history teaches us something about how easy it is to get stuck in such situations, about how seductive arguments to increase our involvement might become after we invest massive resources in this phase of the counter-insurgency campaign. It troubles me that, because of the drug-related elements of the Colombia issue, we in this body are not, perhaps, walking into this scheme with our eyes wide open to these dangers. 
   But my primary concern, Mr. President, is the impact that Plan Colombia could have on the 
   human rights of Colombians. The Colombian military, which this package of assistance would directly support, has been involved in serious human rights abuses and has a record of collaborating with the murderous paramilitary forces that terrorize Colombian citizens. The package in the foreign operations appropriations bill seems, in the words of the Economist magazine, to ``merely bolt three shiny new antidrugs battalions on to an abusive and unreformed military force.'' That action would escalate a war in which civilians bear the brunt of the violence. I know that Senator LEAHY has worked hard to establish human rights conditions for the use of this assistance. But I am not at all certain that it is appropriate for the United States to engage the Colombian military to this degree at this time. 
   I note that the Senator from Vermont has a point when he questions  the emergency designation for this spending package. Colombia has been in crisis for some time. But of course, the emergency designation frees this body from fiscal discipline--discipline, Mr. President, that we badly need. 
   In contrast, for a genuine emergency, for the devastating flooding in southern Africa, this bill provides only one-eighth, one eighth, of the administration's request. It was not so long ago, that the entire country was moved by video and photographs of the people of southeastern Africa, clinging to life in trees and rooftops as flood waters rushed past them. These floods were particularly tragic because the country most seriously affected by them, Mozambique, has made significant strides toward recovery from its long and brutal civil war. Though the country is still affected by extreme poverty, in recent years Mozambique has enjoyed exceptional rates of economic growth. While more needs to be done, the country has improved its record with regard to basic human rights. Mr. President, the people of Mozambique have been fighting for a better future. This kind of disaster comes at a terrible time, and it will require the assistance of the international community to help the people of Mozambique to hold to the opportunities that lay before them before the waters rose. 
   And an appropriate level of funding for the communities ravaged by flooding in southern Africa is just the beginning. Even a cursory glance will indicate that there is a great deal that is not in this appropriations bill. 
   The news is not entirely bad. I applaud the increased funding levels to combat the global HIV/AIDS crisis, which I believe is one of the most important international issues that this country faces in this new millennium, although I would still like to see that level increase. 
   And I am pleased to see provisions linking the resumption of certain military and security assistance programs for Indonesia to key conditions--conditions which bolster the position of reformers in the new government by requiring real accountability for human rights abuses and real cooperation with the international community on matters relating to East Timorese refugees. On this note, I would point out to my colleagues the fact that UNHCR personnel recently suspended activities in three refugee camps in West Timor because the security situation in these camps, where military-backed militias continue their campaign of intimidation and destabilization, has made it impossible to for humanitarian workers to continue to do their jobs. Provisions like those included in this bill are still critically important as are the more comprehensive provisions of a bill that I have introduced, S. 2621, the East Timor Repatriation and Security Act of 2000. 
   Despite the laudable elements, this bill funds only $75 million of the administration's $262 million debt relief request--and that's excluding the $210 million supplemental request, which also goes unfunded. This bill barely addresses the crushing debt burden that stands as an obstacle to growth and development throughout much of the developing world. 
   This bill allocates only $85 million for peacekeeping operations. That is a sizable cut. It is likely to threaten one of the most logical and far-sighted initiatives that we have in this area, Mr. President, the African Crisis Response Initiative, or ACRI, which trains African militaries to help them to become more effective in working to secure stability and share the global burden of peacekeeping. 
   This bill cuts two of the most important accounts for international development aid, the ESF account and the World Bank IDA account, below fiscal year 2000 levels. 
   The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has found that the U.S., when compared to twenty other donor nations worldwide devotes the smallest portion of its national resources to development aid--the smallest portion by far. The typical donor country in the study contributed more than three times the share of national resources that the U.S. contributes. In fact, the U.S. fails--and fails miserably--to contribute the U.N. target level of even point-seven-percent--not seven percent, but seven-tenths of one percent--in aid to the developing world. The Center found that, using a number of different sources, the level of U.S. development aid in fiscal year 2001 would be equal to its lowest level since the end of World War II, measured as a share of the economy. That conclusion refers to the Administration's request, a request that this bill falls $1.7 billion below the President's request. I believe that we must exercise more foresight and that we must re-think our priorities to make more room for the world around us and for the global context in which our great nation will operate in this new century. 
   I believe strongly in fiscal discipline. I believe in governing within our means. I know that means tough choices. But I also know some of the appropriations bills we have just passed and no doubt will see more of the same as we consider spending in fiscal year 2001. Yet we continue the disturbing trend, a trend that I believe runs counter to our national interest and counter to our national identity, of turning our back on the rest of the world. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate continues to debate this year's Transportation Appropriations bill, I am pleased to again express my support for high-speed passenger rail. Efficient high-speed passenger rail has many benefits: it helps to relieve some of our ever-increasing traffic congestion, it provides increased mobility for both business and personal travel, and it reduces pollution of the air we breathe. I have long supported a truly intermodal and effective transportation system and high-speed rail is a vital link in that chain. 
   Federal assistance is essential for the development of transit systems such as high-speed rail. The Federal Government has long had a major role, of course, in funding America's transportation network, from construction and maintenance of the interstate highway system to providing mass transit assistance to local governments. I believe the federal role is important because we need a coherent, responsible national transportation policy. 
   But I believe it is appropriate that state and local officials have the greatest role in making the important decisions about where our transportation money is spent, because they are the people who deal with the demands on all the elements of the transportation system on a daily basis. The great thing about high-speed passenger rail is that it incorporates the best of both worlds. 
   The Federal Government should be the partner of state and local government in transportation, where there are local, state and national interests. While it is crucial that we provide adequate funds for high-speed rail, it is also important for the Federal Government to support high-speed rail in other ways. To this end, I urge the Federal Railroad Administration to further develop its outreach activities to help promote awareness of high-speed rail as a viable option for providing dependable intercity transportation. 
   I am committed to supporting a sound national transportation infrastructure and to developing thoughtful, fair transportation policy that reflects the changing needs of our Nation and respects the role of state and local government as the main decision-makers. High speed passenger rail fits the bill.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I support the Senate motion to instruct the Conferees on fuel economy standards. This issue has been controversial in my state, and I believe its effect on automobile fuel economy standards is not well understood. 
   My vote today is about Congress getting out of the way and letting a federal agency meet the requirements of federal law originally imposed by Congress. I support this motion because I am concerned that Congress has for more than 5 years blocked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), part of the federal Department of Transportation (DOT), from meeting its legal duty to evaluate whether there is a need to modify fuel economy standards by legislative rider since Fiscal Year 1996. The motion instructs the Conferees not recede to Section 318 of the House bill. 
   As I made clear last year, I have made no determination about what fuel economy standards should be. NHTSA is not required under the law to increase fuel economy standards, but it is required to examine on a regular basis whether there is a need for changes to fuel economy standards. NHTSA has the authority to set new standards for a given model year taking into account several factors: technological feasibility, economic practicability, other vehicle standards such as those for safety and environmental performance, and the need to conserve energy. I want NHTSA to fully and fairly evaluate all the criteria, and then make an objective recommendation on the basis of those facts. After NHTSA makes a recommendation, if it does so, I will then consult with all interested parties--unions, environmental interests, auto manufacturers, and other interested Wisconsin citizens about their perspectives on NHTSA's recommendation. 
   However, just as the outcome of NHTSA's assessment should not be pre-judged, the language of the House rider certainly should not have so blatantly pre-judged and precluded any new objective assessment of fuel economy standards. Section 318 of the House bill, identical to last year's language, states:  
   None of the funds in this Act shall be available to prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulations pursuant to title V of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (49 U.S.C. 32901 et seq.) prescribing corporate average fuel economy standards for automobiles, as defined in such title, in any model year that differs from standards promulgated for such automobiles prior to enactment of this section.  
   The House language effectively prevents NHTSA from collecting any information about the impact of changing the fuel economy standards in any way. Under the House language, not only would NHTSA be prohibited from collecting information or developing standards to raise fuel economy standards, it couldn't collect information or develop standards to lower them either. The House language assumes that NHTSA has a particular agenda, that NHTSA will recommend standards which can't be achieved without serious impacts, and uses an appropriations bill to circumvent the law's requirements to evaluate fuel efficiency and maintain the current standards again for another fiscal year. I cannot support retaining this rider in the law. 
   The NHTSA should be allowed to provide Congress with information about whether fuel efficiency improvements are possible and advisable. Congress needs to understand whether or not improvements in fuel economy can and should be made using existing technologies. Congress should also know which emerging technologies may have the potential to improve fuel economy. Congress also needs to know that if improvements are technically feasible, what is the appropriate time frame in which to make such changes in order to avoid harm to our auto sector employment. I don't believe that Congress should confuse our role as policymakers with our obligation to appropriate funds. Changes in fuel economy standards could have a variety of consequences. I seek to understand those consequences and to balance the concerns of those interested in seeing improvements to fuel economy as a means of reducing gasoline consumption and associated pollution. 
   I deeply respect the views of those who are concerned that a change in fuel economy would threaten the economic prosperity of Wisconsin's automobile industry. I have heard strongly  from my state that a sharp increase in fuel economy standards, implemented in the very near term, will have serious consequences. I want to avoid consequences that will unduly burden Wisconsin workers and their employers. In the end, I would like to see that Wisconsin consumers have a wide range of new automobiles, SUVs, and trucks available to them that are as fuel efficient as can be achieved while balancing energy concerns with technological and economic impacts. That balancing is required by the law. I fully expect NHTSA to proceed with the intent to fully consider all those factors. 
   In supporting this motion, I take the position that the agency responsible for collecting information about fuel economy be allowed to do its job, in order to help me do my job. I expect them to be fair and neutral in that process and I will work with interested Wisconsinites to ensure that their views are represented and the regulatory process proceeds in a fair and reasonable manner toward whatever conclusions the merits will support.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I offer an amendment that will restore a measure of pay equity for our nation's Guardsmen and Reservists. I offered this same amendment last year to S..4, the military pay increase bill, and it was adopted by voice vote. 
   I understand that this amendment is acceptable to the managers on both sides, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their continuing cooperation on this important issue. 
   Mr. President, the men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves are cornerstones of our national defense and domestic infrastructure, and they deserve to be adequately and equitably compensated for their dedicated service to this country. 
   The Guard and Reserve are integral parts of overseas missions, including recent and ongoing missions in places, including Iraq and the Balkans. According to statements by Department of Defense officials, Guardsmen and Reservists will continue to play an increasingly important role in our national defense strategy as they are called upon to shoulder more of the burden of military operations both at home and abroad. The National Guard and Reserves deserve the full support they need to carry out their duties. 
   Mr. President, my amendment would correct special duty assignment pay inequities between the Reserve components of our Armed Forces and their active duty counterparts. These inequities should be address to take into account the National Guard and Reserves' increased role in our national security, especially on the front lines. 
   My amendment allows a Guardsmen or Reservist who is entitled to basic pay and is performing a special duty to be paid special duty assignment pay. 
   Right now, Guardsmen and Reservists are getting shortchanged despite the vital role they play in our national defense. The special duty assignment pay program ensures readiness by compensating specific soldiers who are assigned to duty positions that demand special training and extraordinary effort to maintain a level of satisfactory performance. The program, as it stands now, effectively reduces the ability of the National Guard and Reserve to retain highly dedicated and specialized soldiers. 
   The special duty assignments pay program provides an additional monthly financial incentive paid to enlisted soldiers and airmen who are required to perform extremely demanding duties that require an unusual degree of responsibility. These special duty assignments include certain command sergeants major, guidance counselors, retention non-commissioned officers (NCO's), drill sergeants, and members of the Special Forces. These soldiers, however, do not receive special duty assignment pay while in on IDT status (drill weekends). 
   I am pleased that the underlying bill as reported by the Armed Services Committee contains a provision that increases the maximum rate for special duty assignment pay from $275 per month to $600 per month. This modest increase, coupled with my amendment, will help to ensure that our Guardsmen and Reservists are fairly compensated for their service. 
   This is especially important since National Guard and Reserve members give up their civilian salaries during the time they are called up for, or volunteer for, active duty. 
   Mr. President, as the U.S. military prepares to face the challenges of the next century and beyond, the National Guard and Reserves will be called more frequently to active duty for domestic support roles and various peacekeeping efforts abroad. They will also be vital players on special teams trained to deal with emerging threats, including the possibility of the deployment of weapons of mass destruction within our own borders. According to many military experts, this represents a more salient threat to the United States than the threat of a ballistic missile attack that many of our colleagues have spent so much time addressing. 
   Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to see some of these soldiers off as they embarked on these missions and have welcomed them home upon their return. I am struck by the courage and professionalism they displayed as they prepare to meet these varied assignments. In Wisconsin, the State Guard provides vital support during natural disasters and state emergencies, including floods, ice storms, and train derailments. 
   We have a duty to honor the service of our National Guardsmen and Reservists. One way to do that is to equitably compensate them for their service. 
   Again, I thank the managers of the bill for their courtesy and for their cooperation on this important amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the bill's managers, the Senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, and the Senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, for assisting me with this amendment. I also deeply appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. THOMPSON, who joins me as a co-sponsor of this amendment, and of his staff who assisted my staff in developing an acceptable final version. 
   This amendment extends the authority of the General Services Administration to convey surplus property to local governments for law enforcement purposes for two years until the end of December 2002. This amendment will help a number of communities across the country seeking to use surplus property to protect their citizens and provide safe, secure facilities for their police departments. Without this amendment, the authority to convey surplus property for law enforcement purposes would expire at the end of July, 2000. Communities that want to use the GSA process, and have counted upon doing so, to negotiate the use of property for law enforcement purposes at a reduced cost would have been shut out in the matter of a few weeks. 
   In fact, Mr. President, I have just such a situation in my own home state. The City of Kewaunee, Wisconsin wants to acquire the city's Army Reserve Center, which is a former federal armory building. The City intends to use the property as a municipal building in which they would house their police force and other municipal offices. 
   Congress has specified a number of public purpose uses for which property can be transferred to local governments at a reduced cost. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act allows property to be transferred to public agencies and institutions at discounts of up to 100 percent of fair market value for a number of purposes: public health or educational uses, public parks or recreational areas, historic monuments, homeless assistance, correctional institutions, port facilities, public airports, wildlife conservation, and self-help housing. This type of transfer is called a public interest conveyance. 
   I strongly believe that law enforcement is an important public purpose for which surplus property should be used. Moreover, in fairness to local communities with tight budgets, Congress needs to preserve this option for communities that are counting on being able to use this authority. 
   Again, I am delighted that the bill managers have decided to accept this amendment, and I hope that this provision will be retained in Conference.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last year I delivered a statement for the record commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising, during which His Holiness the Dalai Lama and more than 100,000 Tibetans were forced to flee their homeland as a result of brutal suppression by the Chinese government. Unfortunately, the human rights situation in Tibet has not improved, and has if anything deteriorated over the past year. 
   U.S. Administration officials and Congressional supporters of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China often claim that more open trade with the West will expose ordinary Chinese to new ideas, new ideals, and a new independence from the State. This will awaken their desire for more freedom, paving the way for democracy in China. I have often voiced skepticism about these claims. 
   We do not have to wait for the people of Tibet to express their yearning for freedom. They have continuously struggled for their rights for over forty years, and have paid dearly for their actions. Their efforts so far have failed, not because they do not yearn to be free, but rather because their efforts are brutally suppressed and we are apparently little able to help them. Even our efforts in March to introduce at the annual meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights a resolution condemning PRC officials' human rights practices in China and Tibet were blocked by the PRC and most of the industrialized nations. 
   If the Administration and Congress are serious about their efforts to promote human rights in China, surely Tibet should be the bellwether. We need to find concrete ways to demonstrate this commitment, and to encourage other countries to do the same.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. 
   Mr. President, I begin our side of the debate. 
   I rise in favor of the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman amendment. 
   I hope we will have an overwhelming vote later this afternoon in favor of full disclosure of the contributions and expenditures of 527 organizations. As we discussed yesterday on the floor, these organizations are the new stealth player in our electoral system. They claim a tax exemption under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, a provision that was intended to cover political committees such as party organizations or PACs. At the same time, they refuse to register with the Federal Election Commission and report their activities like other political committees because they claim they are not engaged so-called express advocacy. 
   In other words, these groups admit they exist for the purpose of influencing elections for purposes of the tax laws, but deny they are political committees for purposes of the election laws. That, my colleagues, is the very definition of evading the law. If it is legal, it is, as some have called it, the ``mother of all loopholes.''

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I do want to emphasize that there is no constitutional problem with this bill. First, there is no constitutional right to a tax exemption, the Supreme Court has made that abundantly clear. This amendment simply requires disclosure as a condition of receiving a tax exemption. If a group doesn't want to make these disclosures, it can simply pay taxes on its income like any other business in the United States. Second, we don't have a problem of vagueness or line drawing here that might implicate first amendment rights. The disclosure requirements are not triggered by any particular action or communication that a group might make. It is triggered by its decision to claim a tax exemption under section 527. Thus, as I said before, these groups self-identify. They make the decision whether they are 527 and if they do, they have to disclose. 
   There is a simple principle at stake here. It is a question of disclosure versus secrecy. I say to all my colleagues who have argued here on the floor that we do not need reform, we do not need a soft money ban, that all we need is disclosure: Now is the time to put your money where your mouth is. If you vote against this amendment--if you vote against this amendment for disclosure, you will never again be able to argue with any credibility that you support full disclosure. The time has come to put an end to secret money funding secret organizations. As I said yesterday, the combination of money, politics, and secrecy is a dangerous invitation to scandal. What these organizations have done so far in this election cycle, in my view, already is a scandal. Let's agree to this amendment and put a stop to it.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. In response to the question of the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Pennsylvania, fortunately, is plain wrong about the issue of whether this covers other groups. As the Senator from Arizona said, in my opening remarks, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I pointed out that this doesn't just cover the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club has said it has a 527 organization to use very large donations from wealthy individuals totaling $4.5 million. 
   How can the Senator from Pennsylvania even begin to say that we have not included groups on both sides? The amendment is evenhanded. 
   As the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, there were reports of groups from both the right and the left using this loophole. Any group claiming this loophole would have to disclose. So it is simply false that it would not include them.

   It is simply untrue that we are not covering groups on both sides. I specifically mentioned the Sierra Club and $4.5 million to cover that.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is not about politics. I assure my colleagues, this amendment covers all groups regardless of their politics. Not only do we not cover the AFL-CIO, we don't cover the Chamber of Commerce. The National Right to Life, as with those aspects of the Sierra Club that are 501(c)(4), has to publicly disclose through a tax return whether they are constituted in that manner. The argument and the attempt to somehow suggest that the rules will be one way for some groups rather than others is simply false, as were the other points made by the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
   This is an appropriate place to raise this issue. 
   Let me take a moment to respond to the trumped up charge that the Senate cannot consider this amendment because the House might blue-slip the bill. I think some people are trying to use this charge as a fig leaf for voting against campaign finance disclosure. My first response to my opponent's attack is that this is not a bill for raising revenue. The McCain-Feingold-Lieberman amendment is merely a reporting requirement. It requires that those with a certain status report specified actions. 
   Second, the House's decision to blue-slip a bill, to refuse to consider a bill, is an act of discretion on the part of the House of Representatives. It does not happen automatically. It requires the House to pass a resolution to put this blue-slip into place, and the House can choose to consider this measure if it wants to. 
   Third, the Senate can and must be its own judge of what it considers to be ``bills for raising revenue'' within the meaning of the Constitution. The Senate does not have to adhere slavishly to the most wildly blown interpretation of what somehow constitutes bills for raising revenue, or else in the end the Senate would never be able to send to the House of Representatives any bill the House didn't favor. Someone in the House, anyone, could raise a charge, however baseless, that the bill was a bill for raising revenue and then just somehow stop it dead in its tracks. 
   In this regard, I note it is deeply ironic that some in this majority are suddenly becoming so zealous about enforcing the House's prerogatives to originate bills for raising revenue. The House has a longstanding tradition of considering all appropriation bills to be bills for raising revenue within the meaning of the Constitution. If the Senate were to send the House an S-numbered appropriations bill, the House could blue-slip that bill as well. Of late, the majority has shown a great enthusiasm for taking up S-numbered appropriation bills notwithstanding this threat. The majority cannot have it both ways on this point.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Finally, Mr. President, the most powerful argument against the opponents' attempt to hide behind the fig leaf of this sham constitutional objection is that their famed concern for the prerogatives of the House of Representatives will not fool anyone. This is a vote on campaign finance reform, pure and simple. In the end, when colleagues go back home and when a constituent asks them why they opposed campaign finance reform, if they answer, Well, it might have had a blue-slip problem, I don't think the explanation is going to work very well. That is not cover. The fig leaf is transparent, and the people will see right through it. 
   This is a vote about campaign finance reform, pure and simple. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, very simply, this is a vote on campaign finance reform. The question is whether this body will take the opportunity, offered by this amendment, to shine some sunlight on the secret money that these 527 organizations are pouring into our elections. 
   Here it is on this chart, in black and white, from the web site of one of these groups. The contributions can be given in unlimited amounts. They can be from any source. And they are not political contributions and are not a matter of public record. 
   All this amendment does is make it a matter of public record. The American people have a right to demand this information from any organization that is given tax exemption. 
   The blue-slip argument is a figleaf. It is an excuse made up for those who oppose reform but have said they support disclosure. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against the point of order and for the amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the Zimbabwe Democracy Act of 2000. I am very pleased to join my colleague, Senator FRIST, in cosponsoring this legislation and sending an unambiguous signal to the current government of Zimbabwe that the international community will not passively stand aside while that country's great promise is squandered; the United States will not remain silent while the rule of law is undermined by the very government charged with protecting a legal order; this Congress will not accept the deliberate dismantling of justice and security and stability in Zimbabwe. 
   Since the ruling party lost the outcome of a February referendum, in which voters rejected a new constitution which would have granted President Robert Mugabe sweeping powers, a terrible campaign of violence has gripped the country. Veterans of Zimbabwe's independence struggle and supporters of the ruling party have invaded a number of farms owned by white Zimbabweans. When the courts ordered the police to evict the invaders, President Mugabe explicitly continued to support the invasions, and called on the police force to ignore the court. Predictably, confusion and violence have ensued, and the rule of law, the basic protections upon which people around the world stake their safety and the safety of their families, has been seriously eroded. 
   This is not a race war. Let me repeat that--this is not a race war. Race is not the critical issue in Zimbabwe today. And no one need take my word for that. One need only look at the facts on the ground. One need only observe the disturbing frequency with which members of the opposition have been the targets of violence. It is the Movement for Democratic Change, an opposition party that has been rapidly gaining the support of the disillusioned electorate, that is the real target of President Mugabe's campaign. It is the electorate that rejected the ruling party's proposed constitution that is suffering, and this is not unprecedented. In the early 1980s, supporters of a rival political faction were brutally slaughtered in Matabeleland--a dark period  in the young country's history for which there is still not a satisfying public account. So we must not be intimidated by the scape-goating of the power-hungry. Once there was a struggle against a terrible system of oppression, grounded in racial discrimination, in the country now called Zimbabwe. But that is not the heart of the matter today. 
   Nor is this crisis really about land tenure reform, although there is no question at all that land tenure reform is desperately needed and long overdue in Zimbabwe. But the government's past efforts at land reform have too often involved distributing land to key supporters of the ruling party, not the landless and truly needy. Fundamentally, land reform is about improving quality of life for the people of Zimbabwe--something that is utterly undermined by the violent tactics of the ruling party today. 
   So while this is not about race and it is not, at its core, about land, what this is about is an increasingly discredited President, who, watching his legacy turn increasingly into a source of shame rather than celebration, has hatched a desperate campaign to cling to power, even though this campaign, if successful, would render him the leader of an utterly broken country. Runaway government spending has led to high inflation and unemployment. Corruption infects the state. And, at this time of economic strain and hardship, the Government of Zimbabwe is spending over $1.5 million a month on its participation in the Congo conflict. 
   The Zimbabwe Democracy Act indicates that the U.S. will have no part of the terrible campaign of violence now compounding Zimbabwe's troubles. The bill suspends U.S. assistance to Zimbabwe while carving out important exceptions--humanitarian relief, food or medical assistance provided to non-governmental organizations for humanitarian purposes, programs which support democratic governance and the rule of law, and technical assistance relating to ongoing land reform programs outside the auspices of the government of Zimbabwe. And it articulates clear conditions for ending this suspension of assistance--including a return to the rule of law, free and fair parliamentary and presidential elections, and a demonstrated commitment on the part of the Government of Zimbabwe to an equitable, legal, and transparent land reform program. 
   The bill also offers assistance to the remarkable forces working within Zimbabwe in support of the rule of law, in support of democracy, and in support of basic human rights for all of Zimbabwe's citizens. It establishes a fund to finance the legal expenses for individuals and institutions challenging restrictions on free speech in Zimbabwe, where the latest campaign has also included a media crackdown. The fund would also support individuals and democratic institutions who have accrued costs or penalties in the pursuit of elective office or democratic reform. 
   I had the chance to be in Zimbabwe in December, and I do not believe that I have ever encountered a more dynamic, committed, and genuinely inspiring group of civil society leaders than the group I met in Harare a few months ago. These forces must not be abandoned in Zimbabwe's time of crisis. 
   And, very responsibly, this legislation recognizes that Zimbabwe will need the assistance of the international community when it seeks to rebuild once the crisis has passed. It authorizes support for ongoing, legally governed land tenure reforms, and authorizes an innovative approach to facilitating the development of commercial projects in Zimbabwe and the region. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I commend Senator FRIST and his staff for their efforts on this matter. Right now a country of great promise and a people of tremendous potential are enduring a terrible campaign of lawlessness and oppression. Right now, one of the most important states on the African continent, economically and politically, is in crisis. To write off Zimbabwe, to lose this opportunity to speak and act on the matter, would be a terrible mistake. 
   States descend into utter chaos in stages. Let us move to arrest Zimbabwe's descent today, not next year, when the problems will be more complex and more deeply entrenched, and not after 5 years of crisis, when Afro-pessimists will undoubtedly ignore the country's proud history and cynically assert that Zimbabwe cannot be salvaged. Let us be far-sighted, let us act now, pass this legislation, and stand firmly behind the forces of law, of democracy, and of justice in Zimbabwe.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if there is one thing on which the entire Senate should be able to agree, it is that we need to have full disclosure by groups participating in the electoral process by running advertisements that mention candidates. 
   This is a first step. In fact, it is only a first step on this bill. We intend to offer other steps, including our McCain-Feingold legislation concerning soft money, on this bill. But this is the first step. 
   The so-called 527 organizations that this amendment addresses are the newest wrinkle in the breakdown of our campaign finance laws. 
   These 527 groups are now openly and proudly flouting the election laws by running phony issue ads and refusing to register with the FEC as political committees or disclose their spending and contributors. It is time that Congress called a stop to this, not to try to keep anyone from speaking or otherwise participating in elections, but to give the American people information that they desperately need and deserve about who is behind the ads that are already flooding our airwaves, six months before the election. 
   There is no reason that our tax laws should give protection to any group that refuses to play by the election law rules. For that reason, I have cosponsored and wholeheartedly endorse S. 2582, a bill introduced earlier this year by Senators LIEBERMAN, DASCHLE, MCCAIN, and others to restrict the tax exempt status available under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code only to those groups that register and report with the FEC. This amendment is even more mild. But at the very least, the public deserves more information on the financial backers and activities of groups that benefit from this tax exempt status, and that is what this amendment attempts to provide. This amendment simply seeks disclosure. It would be a small step towards addressing one of the loopholes in our current campaign laws that is eroding the public's faith in our electoral system. It's a small step, but an important step. It is the first step, and the second step is the ban on soft money. 
   Time and time again when we have debated reform here on the floor of the Senate, the opponents of the McCain-Feingold bill have said that they favor full and complete disclosure of campaign contributions and spending. 
   The Senator from Arizona did a fine job of sharing with us some of the quotes from Senators who said they would support disclosure even if they couldn't support a ban on soft money. 
   Well, those Senators who so confidently proclaim that full disclosure is the answer to our campaign finance problems should realize that they cannot be consistent in that view if they don't support this amendment. All this amendments seeks is disclosure, the most basic and commonsense tenet of our campaign finance laws, by groups that are spending millions of dollars to influence elections. It is said that sunshine is the best disinfectant. Here is our chance to throw some sunshine on this latest effort to cast a dark cloud on our campaign finance system. 
   Sadly, what to me is perhaps the most shameful thing about this whole process is we know that many Members of Congress are involved in raising money for these 527s. 
   Recently, there was a very disturbing report in the Washington Post about the majority leader urging hi-tech companies to contribute to a new group called Americans for Job Security that is now running ads supporting one of our colleagues who is up for reelection. Americans for Job Security is almost certainly claiming a tax exemption under section 527, but at the same 
   time it will not disclose its contributors or its spending. And we all know of the highly publicized connections between the majority whip in the House, Mr. DELAY, and various 527 organizations.  
   These groups pose a special danger to the political process because if Members of Congress can organize them or raise money for them, the real possibility of corruption emerges. What is the difference between a million dollar contribution directly to a candidate and a million dollar contribution requested by a candidate that goes to a group that plans to run ads to support that candidate or, more likely, attack his or her opponent? There really is no difference when you come right down to it, but right now, the first contribution is illegal, as it should be, and the second contribution is not. It is legal. Our amendment does not prohibit that second contribution, it just asks that it be made public. 
   As groups proliferate, the chances of scandal increase as well. It will not be long before reports of legislative favors received by big donors to 527 groups start making the headlines. Or foreign money or money derived from organized crime making its way into our election process by way of 527s. The 527 loophole is a ticking time bomb of scandal. 
   As noted in the recent Common Cause report, ``Under the Radar: The Attack of Stealth PACs on our Nation's Elections,'' here are some of the groups that are taking advantage of the 527 loophole to collect unlimited contributions and use them to influence federal elections without any disclosure. Saving America's Families Everyday, the Republican Majority issues Committee, Citizens for Better Medicare, Republicans for Clean Air, Shape the Debate, Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, the Peace Voter Fund, citizens for Reform, and the Sierra Club. When the American people see an ad by one of these groups, they will know it is coming from a Stealth PAC, a 527, but that's all they will know because these groups are currently not reporting anything to the FEC or the IRS. 
   Money, politics, and secrecy is a dangerous mixture. Mr. President. The least we can do is address the secrecy ingredient in this potion with this amendment. There is no justification whatsoever for allowing these groups to operate under the radar. None. Citizens deserve to know who is behind a message that is being delivered to them in the heat of a campaign. These groups that hide behind apple pie names are trying to obscure their identities from the public. The public is entitled to that information. And it is entitled to withhold a tax exemption from any group that would refuse to provide the information. 
   I think I have heard from almost every one of my colleagues recently that they believe this campaign finance system is completely out of control, that they sense it is about to completely explode. We all know it. It is completely out of control. This is a first step to try to bring that control back and then to move on quickly to the effort to address the other even more enormous problem at this point--the problem of soft money being contributed to political parties. 
   I thank the Senator from Arizona and my colleagues on the floor, the Senators from Connecticut and New York, for their work. 
   I yield the floor.

Improvements in DNA testing have allowed us to determine with greater accuracy whether certain offenders committed the crime that sent them to prison, including, very importantly, of course, those who have been condemned to death row. 
   Since the 1970s, 87 people sentenced to die were later proven innocent. Some of those innocent death row inmates were able to prove their innocence based on modern DNA testing of biological evidence. But, Mr. President, this is not just about ensuring that we not condemn the innocent. DNA testing can also ensure that the guilty person not go free. DNA testing can be a tool for the prosecution to determine whether they have the right person. 
   Over the last several months, I have spoken often on the floor about the serious flaws in the administration of capital punishment across the nation. I strongly support Senator LEAHY's bill. It is a much over-due package of reforms that goes after some of the worst failings in our nation's administration of capital punishment--those that are unfair, unjust and plain just un-American. 
   Very simply, Senator LEAHY's bill can help save lives. His bill would make it less likely for an innocent man or woman to be sent to death row, where biological evidence is central to the issue of guilt or innocence. The bill also would make it more likely that a poor person receive adequate defense representation and less likely that a poor person gets stuck with a lawyer that sleeps through trial. Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about specific examples of such cases of egregious failings of defense counsel. 
   We must ensure the utmost fairness in the administration of this ultimate punishment. I hope our colleagues--both those who support the death penalty in principle and those who oppose it--will join together in fixing this broken system and restoring fairness and justice. All Americans demand and deserve no less. 
   Mr. President, I think it is very significant that this important bill now has bipartisan support. I want to thank and commend my colleagues, Senators GORDON SMITH, SUSAN COLLINS and JAMES JEFFORDS, for recognizing that flaws exist in our system of justice and acknowledging that something has to be done about it. I hope this is a sign that we can work together with the very real goal of passing this bill this year. Until we do so, the lives of innocent people literally hang in the balance.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Federal Government has not executed a person in the name of people of the United States of America since 1963. For 37 years, we as a people have not taken that fateful, irreversible step. I rise today because all that is apparently about to change. 
   Since January, I have come to the Senate floor several times to urge my colleagues to support a moratorium on executions and a review of the administration of capital punishment. Mr. President, the need for that moratorium has now become more urgent. 
   During the Senate recess just ended, a Federal judge in Texas set a date for the execution of Juan Raul Garza. In only two months, on August 5, he could become the first prisoner that the Federal Government has put to death since 1963. 
   In the early hours of a Saturday morning, when most Americans will be sleeping, Federal authorities will strap Mr. Garza to a gurney at a new Federal facility in Terre Haute, Indiana. They will put the needle in his vein. And they will deliver an injection that will kill him. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to invite my colleagues to consider the wisdom of this action. 
   More and more Americans, including prosecutors, police, and those fighting on the front lines of the battle against crime, are rethinking the fairness, the efficacy, and the freedom from error of the death penalty. Senator LEAHY, a former federal prosecutor, has introduced the Innocence Protection Act, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. Congressman DELAHUNT and Congressman LAHOOD have introduced the same bill in the House. Congressman DELAHUNT, also a former prosecutor, is concerned that our current system of administering the death penalty is far from just. He has said: ``If you spent 20 years in the criminal justice system, you would be very concerned about what goes on.'' 
   In my own home state of Wisconsin, at least eleven active and former state and Federal prosecutors have said that executions do not deter crime and could result in executing the innocent. Michael McCann, the well-respected District Attorney of Milwaukee County, has said that prosecution is a human enterprise bound to have mistakes. 
   Mr. President, police--the people on the front lines of the battle against crime--are coming out against the death penalty. They are finding that it is bad for law enforcement. Recently, when police chiefs were asked about the death penalty, they said that it was counterproductive. Capital cases are incredibly resource-intensive. They do not yield a reduction in crime proportional to other, more moderate law-enforcement activities. 
   A former police chief of Madison, Wisconsin, for example, has said that he fears that the death penalty would make police officers' jobs more dangerous, not less so. He expressed concern that a suspect's incentive to surrender peacefully is diminished when the government has plans to execute. 
   Ours is a system of justice founded on fairness and due process. The Framers of our democracy had a healthy distrust for the power of the state when arrayed against the individual. Many of the lawyers in the early United States of America had on their shelf a copy of William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, where it is written: ``For the law holds, that it is better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.'' And Benjamin Franklin wrote, ``That it is better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer. . . .'' 
   Our Constitution and Bill of Rights reflect this concern for the protection of the individual against the might of the state. The fourth amendment protects: ``The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. . . .'' The fifth amendment protects against being ``deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . .'' The sixth amendment guarantees that ``the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.'' And the eighth amendment prohibits ``cruel and unusual punishments.'' 
   Our system of government is deeply grounded in the defense of the individual against the power of the government. Our Nation has a proud tradition of safeguarding the rights of its citizens. 
   But more and more, we are finding that when a person's very life is at stake, our system of justice is failing to live up to the standards that the American people demand and expect. More and more, Americans are finding reason to believe that we have a justice system that can, and does, make mistakes. 
   Americans' sense of justice demands that if new evidence becomes available that could shed light on the guilt or innocence of a defendant, then the defendant should be given the opportunity to present it. Unfortunately, apparently, the people of New York and Illinois are the only ones who understand this. They have enacted laws allowing convicted offenders access to the biological evidence used at trial and modern DNA testing. 
   If you are on death row in a state other than Illinois or New York, you might be able to show a court evidence of your guilt or innocence based on new DNA tests. But your ability to do so rests on whether you're lucky enough to get a prosecutor to agree to the test or convince a court that it should be done. Or, as we have seen very recently, your ability to show your innocence may rest with the decision of the governor. And that raises the risk of a political decision, not necessarily one that is based solely on fairness or justice. 
   Mr. President, I am not surprised that both Texas Governor George Bush and Virginia Governor James Gilmore are no longer confident that every prisoner on death row in their states is guilty and has had full access to the courts. Allowing death row inmates the benefit of a modern DNA test is the fair and just thing to do. But scores of other death row inmates, in Texas, in Virginia, and around the country, may also have evidence exonerating them. They may have DNA evidence. Or they may have other exonerating evidence. We must ensure that all inmates with meritorious claims of innocence have their day in court. But, among problems in our criminal justice system, the lack of full access to DNA testing is, unfortunately, just the tip of the iceberg.  
   Americans' sense of justice demands fair representation and adequate counsel. In the landmark 1963 case of Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court held that ``in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.'' The Court in Gideon wrote:  
   From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him.  
   And, in cases since then, for example the 1988 case of McCoy v. Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court has ruled that: ``It is . . . settled law that an indigent defendant has the same right to effective representation by an active advocate as a defendant who can afford to retain counsel of his or her choice.'' 
   But, Mr. President, more and more, we are finding counsel that fail the standard of adequacy. Drunk lawyers. Sleeping lawyers. Lawyers who never cross-examined. Lawyers whose first trial is a trial where the client's life is on the line. Lawyers who have been subsequently disbarred. 
   We would never allow a podiatrist to perform heart surgery. And we would never allow a surgeon to perform surgery while drunk, or to fall asleep during surgery. But courts, over and over again, have upheld convictions where the defendants' lawyers were not qualified to represent them, slept through trial, or were drunk in court. 
   Take the case of the lawyer Joe Cannon. In 1979, one Mr. Carl Johnson was convicted of murder and sent to death row by a Texas state court. During trial, his lead counsel, Joe Cannon, was often asleep. Cannon's co-counsel, Philip Scardino, was two years out of law school and recalls the whole experience as ``frightening.'' He said, ``All I could do was nudge him sometimes and try to wake him up.'' Johnson's appellate attorney, David Dow, said the trial transcript gives the impression that there was no one in the courtroom defending Johnson. It ``goes on for pages and pages, and there is not a whisper from anyone representing him.'' Mr. Johnson was executed in 1995, the 12th execution under Governor Bush's watch. 
   Now as ``frightening'' as this sounds, the same attorney continued to work capital cases. 
   Like the majority of inmates on Texas' death row, Calvin Burdine could not afford an attorney, so the court paid a lawyer to represent him, and that lawyer again was Joe Cannon. Five years after Johnson's trial, and this time without co-counsel, Cannon represented Burdine, and again slept through crucial moments of the trial. The clerk for the trial judge said Cannon ``was asleep for long periods of time during the questioning of witnesses.'' Three jurors noted he did most of his nodding off in the afternoon, following lunch. Burdine's appellate attorneys contend that highly incriminating hearsay testimony was introduced and reached the jury because the attorney was sleeping. In 1995, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected his claim of ineffective assistance. Burdine's case is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
   As Texas State Senator Rodney Ellis said of the Burdine case on ABC's This Week this past Sunday, ``That is a national embarrassment.'' Incredulously, Senator Ellis lamented: ``[T]he Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled apparently that you can be Rip Van Winkle and still be a pretty good attorney.'' 
   Two years after his death, lawyer Joe Cannon remains a courthouse legend. In a span of about 10 years, twelve of his indigent clients went to death row. 
   Americans' sense of justice demands that the poor, as well as the rich, should get their day in court. Even death penalty supporters like Reverend Pat Robertson recognize that this ultimate punishment appears reserved for the poor. 
   The machinery of death is badly broken. Since the 1970s, 87 people sitting on death row were later proven innocent. That means that for every seven executions, we've found one person innocent. But remember, this is after they were on death row. Eight of the 87 people later proven innocent relied on modern DNA testing to prove their innocence. But access to DNA testing plainly tells only a small part of the story of the mistakes in our criminal justice system. The remaining 79 innocent people gained their release based on other kinds of evidence--evidence like recanted witness testimony. 
   Sometimes, it is evidence that an ineffective attorney fails to introduce at trial. Take the case of Gregory Wilhoit. In 1987, an Oklahoma court sentenced Wilhoit to die for the murder of his estranged wife. The key evidence for the prosecution was expert testimony that a bite mark on the victim matched Wilhoit's. The defense never called an expert to challenge the prosecution's dental expert. The court of appeals granted a new trial, recognizing that Wilhoit had ineffective legal representation. The appellate court noted that his counsel was ``suffering from alcohol dependence and abuse, and brain damage during his representation.'' Wilhoit describes his former attorney as ``a drunk'' and recalls several occasions when the attorney threw up in the judge's chambers. After spending six years on death row, Wilhoit was exonerated after 11 experts--11 experts--testified that the teeth marks did not match. 
   Mr. President, I hate to say it, but this is the worst of government gone amok. People understand that the government can make mistakes in other areas. They can only expect as much here. Columnist George Will recently wrote that conservatives, especially, should be concerned. George Will wrote: ``Capital punishment, like the rest of the criminal justice system, is a government program, so skepticism is in order.'' 
   When we do not exercise that skepticism, when we rush to execute with ever growing speed, we contribute to, rather than detract from, a culture of violence. It deprives us of the greatness that is America. We are better than this. 
   And so, Mr. President, the time has come to pause. That is why today, in the light of the scheduling of the first Federal execution in almost 40 years, and in light of the growing awareness that there are fundamental flaws in our system of justice, I urge my Colleagues to join me in the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act, which I introduced along with Senators LEVIN and WELLSTONE. 
   This bill is a common sense, modest proposal. It merely calls a temporary halt to executions while a national, blue ribbon commission thoroughly examines the administration of capital punishment. The bill simply calls for a pause and a study. That is not too much to ask, when the lives of innocent people hang in the balance. 
   When an airplane careens off a runway, the Federal government steps in to review what went wrong. This Nation's system of capital punishment has veered seriously off-course. It is now clear that it is replete with errors. 
   The time has come to pause and study what is wrong. The time has come to pause and ensure that our system is fair and just. 
   Our American tradition of fairness and due process demands it. Reverence for our democracy's protection of the individual against the state compels as much. The American people's love of justice deserves no less.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator and take my hat off to him and to our neighbor to the south, the State of Illinois. Without the leadership of Illinois, which had the courage to admit that it had a problem, this entire issue would not be receiving the kind of examination occurring across the country. 
   That is to the Senator's credit, to that of the Governor, and to all the people of your State. 
   The bill I have introduced is modeled exactly after the pattern followed in Illinois; that is, the calling of a moratorium by a Governor who is, or at least has been, a death penalty supporter, and then the appointing of a very distinguished blue-ribbon commission, including our former wonderful colleague, Paul Simon, and including both pro- and anti-death penalty people. 
   Under Illinois' leadership, there will be this kind of pause and examination that is open to people of any view on the death penalty, to simply make sure that system is fixed. 
   As the Senator pointed out, Illinois could not possibly be the only State that has this problem. In fact, I predict it will not turn out to be the one with the worst problem in this area. 
   The other States need to join it on this, the Federal Government needs to join, and I compliment your State, as I did in my earlier remarks, as being one of the only two States to recognize the right to have guaranteed DNA testing.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, along with Senator JEFFORDS, I am pleased to introduce the Quality Cheese Act of 2000. This legislation will protect the consumer, save taxpayer dollars and provide support to America's dairy farmers, who have taken a beating in the marketplace in recent years. 
   When Wisconsin consumers have the choice, they will choose natural Wisconsin cheese, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) may change current law, and consumers won't know whether cheese is really all natural or not. 
   If the federal government creates a loophole for imitation cheese ingredients to be used in U.S. cheese vats, cheese bearing the labels ``domestic'' and ``natural'' will no longer be truly accurate. 
   If USDA and FDA allow a change in federal rules, imitation milk proteins known as milk protein concentrate or casein, could be used to make cheese in place of the wholesome natural milk produced by cows in Wisconsin or other part of the U.S. 
   Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by recent efforts to change America's natural cheese standard. This effort to allow milk protein concentrate and casein into natural cheese products flies in the face of logic and could create a loophole for unlimited amounts of substandard imported milk proteins to enter U.S. cheese vats. 
   My legislation will close this loophole and ensure that consumers can be confident that they are buying natural cheese when they see the natural label. 
   Our dairy farmers have invested heavily in processes that make the best quality cheese ingredients, and I am concerned about recent efforts to change the law that would penalize them for those efforts by allowing lower quality ingredients to flood the U.S. market. 
   Over the past decade, cheese consumption has risen at a strong pace due to promotional and marketing efforts and investments by dairy farmers across the country. Year after year, per capita cheese consumption has risen at a steady rate. 
   Back in the 1980's, when I served in the Wisconsin State Senate, cheese consumption topped 20 pounds per person. During the 1990s consumption increased by over 25 percent, and passed 25 pounds per person. Last year we saw an even more dramatic increase when per capita cheese consumption rose an amazing 1.5 pounds to reach 29.8 pounds. 
   This one-year increase amounts to the largest expansion since 1982! I am proud to say that my home state of Wisconsin, America's dairyland, was one of the main engines behind this growth. After all, when consumers see the label ``Wisconsin Cheese,'' they know that it is synonymous with quality. 
   Over the past two decades consumers have increased their cheese consumption due to their understanding, and taste for the quality natural cheese produced by America's dairy industry. 
   Recent proposals to change to our natural cheese standard could decrease consumption of natural cheese. These declines could result from concerns about the origin of casein and other forms of dry UF milk. 
   The vast majority of dry ultra filtered milk originates from countries with State Trading Enterprises. Many of these countries subsidize their dairy exports through these trading mechanisms, and have quality standards that are well below those of the United States. 
   While it is difficult to obtain specific numbers about the amount of dry UF milk produced in foreign countries, I have heard disturbing stories about the conditions under which the casein and milk proteins are sometimes produced. 
   For the most part, dry UF milk is not produced in the US. In fact, it is, for the most part, produced in countries where sanitary standards are well below those of the United States. 
   These products are sold on the international market, and under the proposed rule they could be labeled as natural cheese. This cheap, low quality dry UF milk tends to leave cheese greasy and increases separation problems. 
   The addition of this kind of milk will certainly leave the wholesome reputation of ``natural cheese'' significantly tarnished in the eyes of the consumer. 
   This change would seriously compromise decades of work by America's dairy farmers to build up domestic cheese consumption levels. It is simply not fair to America's farmers! 
   Mr. President, consumers have a right to know if the cheese they buy is unnatural. And by allowing unnatural dry UF milk into cheese, we are denying consumers the entire picture. 
   The Feingold-Jeffords legislation will paint the entire picture for the consumer, and allow them enough information to select cheese made from truly natural ingredients. 
   Allowing dry Ultra-Filtered milk into cheeses will have a significant adverse impact on dairy producers throughout the United States. Some estimate that the annual effect of the change on the dairy farm sector of the economy could be more than $100 million. 
   The proposed change to our natural cheese standard would also harm the American taxpayer. 
   If we allow dry UF milk to be used in cheese we will effectively permit unrestricted importation of these ingredients into the United States. Because there are no tariffs and quotas on these ingredients, these heavily subsidized products will displace natural domestic dairy ingredients. 
   These unnatural domestic dairy products will enter our domestic cheese market and may further depress dairy prices paid to American dairy producers. 
   Low dairy prices result in increased costs to the dairy price support program. So, at the same time that U.S. dairy farmers are receiving lower prices, the U.S. taxpayer will be paying more for the dairy price support program. 
   Mr. President, this change does not benefit the dairy farmer, consumer or taxpayer. Who then is it good for? 
   The obvious answer is nobody. 
   America's farmers have invested a tremendous amount of time and effort create the best cheese industry in the world. They should not be penalized for their efforts. 
   This legislation takes a two pronged approach to address these concerns. First, it prohibits dry ultra-filtered milk from being included in America's natural cheese standard. 
   Second, it requires the Food and Drug administration to conduct a study into the impact of allowing wet ultra-filtered milk into the natural cheese standard. 
   Let me be clear, currently, neither of these products are allowed in America's natural cheese standard. Under current regulations, wet ultra-filtered milk may only be used in natural cheese products if--and only if--both the wet UF milk and the cheese are produced at the same plant. 
   I have heard a number of concerns from dairy farmers, but the most immediate concern is the importation of milk protein concentrate and casein. This legislation is the first step in addressing their concerns, and ensuring that any future changes incorporate the concerns of America's dairy farmers. 
   Congress must shut the door on any backdoor efforts to stack the deck against America's dairy farmers. And we must pass my legislation that prevents a loophole that would allow changes that hurt the consumer, taxpayer and dairy farmer. 
   Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret, even though this is the time that has been allocated by unanimous consent for the final debate on the nominations, particularly the nomination of Brad Smith, I regret there are no other Senators here to debate the nomination. However, I will proceed in any event because it is an important nomination, an important issue. 
   There is an irony about the vote we are about to have in the Senate. The Senate is sure to close up shop at a reasonable hour today. Why? Because tonight the Democratic Party will host the largest fund-raiser in history at the MCI Center here in Washington. The party expects to rake in $24 million in one night, tonight. And this will surpass the previous record for a single fund-raiser of $21.3 million set less than 1 month ago by the Republican Party. That record fundraiser swamped the previous record, also held by the Republican Party, at an event a year earlier, of $14 million. 
   We are in an arms race. The escalation is truly staggering. The insatiable need for bigger and bigger checks is turning our great political parties into little more than fundraiser machines. Forty-seven donors raised or contributed $250,000 or more to go to the fundraiser tonight that my party will hold. Back in April, 45 donors raised or contributed that amount to join the Republican Party leaders at the National Armory. A quarter of a million dollars. Can anyone honestly say the donors who give that money will get no special treatment in return? We all know this money can be corrupting. It certainly provides the appearance of corruption. 
   The Supreme Court knows that contributions of this size can be corrupting. Let me quote the Court, once again, from the Shrink Missouri case decided a few months ago:  
   There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.  
   There is little reason to doubt the corrupting influence of large contributions on our political system, said the Court. 
   At least one person doubts this. Professor Bradley Smith doubts it. Listen to what he wrote in a 1997 Law Review article: Whatever the particulars of reform proposes, it is increasingly clear that reformers have overstated the Government interest in the anticorruption rationale. Money's alleged corrupting effects are far from proven, Professor Smith says. 
   Brad Smith sees nothing wrong with unlimited contributions to parties or even to candidates. He said in a newspaper article that ``people should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics.'' In an interview on MSNBC he said: ``I think we should deregulate and just let it go. That is how our politics was run for over 100 years.'' 
   That ``100 years'' he is referring to is the 19th century. That is the world Brad Smith would like to see; no contribution is too big for us to tolerate in the world he sees. 
   I assure my colleagues that this is not some caricature of this nominee's views. These are not distortions nor are they words taken out of context. This is what this nominee believes. This is 
   what he has said over and over and over again, including at his confirmation hearing before the Rules Committee. Brad Smith sees nothing wrong with the enormous soft money contributions that both parties are so greedily seeking, the kind of contributions my party will rake in, in the largest fundraiser in history, tonight, just a few hours from now. Not only that, he believes to ban soft money would violate the first amendment of the Constitution. 
   Virtually no one still clings to that belief in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in the Shrink Missouri case. Brad Smith does. 
   This nomination may be just as important to the cause of campaign finance reform as any bill that has been before the Senate in recent years. This vote on this nomination is just as significant for campaign finance reform as many of the votes we have had on those bills. I submit to those Senators who have voted time and time again to ban soft money--and I do thank them for their votes, and I thank them for their support of the McCain-Feingold bill--those Senators should think very carefully about what they are doing here. 
   To confirm Brad Smith to a seat on the FEC is to confirm a man whose most deeply held beliefs about the Federal election system are wholly at odds with the reforms we are seeking. If we somehow are able to get past the filibuster and pass a soft money ban this year, Brad Smith will be on the Commission that is charged by law with the duty to implementing that ban. 
   I emphasize again I hold absolutely no personal animus toward Mr. Smith. This is not personal. It is not a matter of personality. I do not question Mr. Smith's integrity. I do not question his honesty. I certainly do not question his right to criticize the laws from outside his perch as a law professor and commentator. However, his views on the very laws he will be called to enforce scare me. It is simply not possible for me to ignore the views he has repeatedly and stridently expressed simply because he now claims he will faithfully execute the laws if he is confirmed. He may try to do that, but in matters of interpretation he will certainly come down on the side of big money in campaigns every time. 
   In a 1997 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith wrote the following:  
   When a law is in need of continual revision to close a series of ever-changing ``loopholes,'' it is probably the law, and not the people, that is in error. Most sensible reform is a simple one: Repeal of the Federal Elections Campaign Act.  
   I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm a man to the FEC who believes the statute that created that body should be scrapped. I urge my colleagues to think about this very hard. Professor Smith's views are not anywhere near the mainstream of legal thought on this issue. Professor Smith may be a wonderful professor and scholar, but he should not be on the Federal Election Commission. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the brief time I have remaining, I want to quickly respond to some of the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky. 
   First of all, the suggestion that the arguments on this side have relied on a caricature of the views of the nominee is simply false. We have been very cautious in the debate to simply rely on Professor Smith's actual words from his voluminous writings, and the Senator from Kentucky in no instance has denied that we accurately quoted Professor Smith. These are his views. There has been no distortion and no caricaturing of his views. 
   Second, the Senator denies the nominee's views on the campaign finance law will affect his ability to discharge his duties as an FEC Commissioner. Of course, I do not believe that people involved in the enforcment of laws have to accept the premise of every single law they are charged to enforce, but this nominee rejects essentially the entire campaign finance law of our country, from the notion dating back to 1907, that is still supposed to be good law today, that a corporation should not be able to give contributions in connection with federal elections, to the notion that labor unions should not be able to make such contributions, according to a 1947 law, to his rejection of the fundamental post-Watergate laws restricting the amounts that individuals can give candidates and parties that we are supposed to live under today. Professor Smith is essentially a campaign finance law anarchist. He does not believe we should have any campaign finance law. The notion that such a person should be on the FEC makes virtually no sense. To take the analogy of the Senator from Kentucky, he says having Professor Smith on the Commission will be like having a prosecutor who cares very much about people's constitutional rights. But the real analogy is that this nominee would be a prosecutor who believes we should repeal just about all of the U.S. Criminal Code. That, to me, is too much. 
   This is not about a litmus test. This is absolutely not about barring this gentleman from public service, as the Senator from Kentucky suggests. If he wants to run for the Senate and pass laws about campaign finance reform, there is an election for the Senate in Ohio this year. He can run. But if his job is to enforce the main body of campaign finance laws in this country, that job cannot be done by someone who believes those laws are entirely inconsistent with the first amendment and have no legal merit. Our election laws are too important to put them at risk in this way. For those reasons, I hope my colleagues reject this nomination.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to keep a promise that I made on this floor a few months ago. 
   In January, I came to the floor to talk about the tragic events that occurred last fall in East Timor. I spoke about the need to encourage the new Indonesian government in its commitment to reform and its resolve to reject the climate of impunity. I withdrew an amendment that would have codified the administration's suspension on military and security assistance for Indonesia East Timor, although I believed then and strongly believe today that Indonesia has not yet met the basic conditions that should be prerequisites for any restoration of military ties with Indonesia. 
   At that time, Mr. President, I pledged to continue to monitor events in Indonesia and in East Timor closely. And I pledged to come to this floor if what I saw troubled me. 
   Let me tell you what I see today. 
   First, I am sorry to say, Mr. President, there have been no trials yet. No one has been brought to justice for the atrocities committed in East Timor  last year. I recognize that the Indonesian government has taken some courageous steps in investigating the atrocities that took place in East Timor, and I commend the Indonesian government for its efforts to date. The Indonesian government and the U.N. have succeeded in signing an agreement to exchange witnesses and evidence that could lead to the prosecution of those responsible for the violence in East Timor. A number of dedicated individuals within the new government continue to work courageously for reform, justice, and accountability. But I note, that obervers have been disturbed by the number of civilian and military police officers that the government has appointed to the team charged with investigating human rights abuses in East Timor. And the simple fact remains--no one has yet been held accountable in a court of law for the acts committed by the military and militias in East Timor last year. 
   A second concern is there has been no change in the situation in West Timor. Today, half a year after the referendum, some 100,000 people are still living in the refugee camps of West Timor, afraid of what will happen to them should they attempt to return home. Some will likely choose to stay in Indonesia, but all reports from the area indicate that many want to return home but do not because of continued intimidation from militia groups. 
   Within the refugee camps, since January there have been about a dozen incidents in which international agencies attempting to deliver aid to the refugees were attacked. According to recent reports, one militia group is so well-organized that it prints a newsletter of fabricated horror stories aimed at dissuading refugees from returning to East Timor. 
   This week the plight of these refugees--at this point the most vulnerable of the original masses--was made even more difficult as they contend with the heavy rains and floods that have already killed at least 148 people. Over a hundred are still missing. When the flood waters recede, these people should have every opportunity to put their lives back together, free from threats and from fear. 
   I look at these facts and I consider that the administration has chosen to take a first step toward lifting its suspension on all forms of military assistance and contacts by inviting the Indonesians to particiapte in a joint exercise, and I am indeed troubled. 
   Today I am introducing a bill, the East Timor Repatriation and Security Act of 2000. The bill codifies the suspension of military and security assistance to Indonesia until certain conditions are met--the same conditions that have been articulated in the past; the same conditions contained in last year's foreign operations appropriations bill. 
   The bill would permit military and security assistance to resume only when the President determines and submits a report to the appropriate congressional committees that the Government of Indonesia and the Indonesian Armed Forces are: 
   Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed forces and militia groups against whom there is credible evidence of human rights violations; 
   Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed forces against whom there is credible evidence of aiding or abetting militia groups; 
   Allowing displaced persons and refugees to return home to East Timor, including providing safe passage for refugees returning from West Timor; 
   Not impeding the activities of the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor; 
   Demonstrating a commitment to preventing incursions into East Timor by members of militia groups in West Timor; and, 
   Demonstrating a commitment to accountability by cooperating with investigations and prosecutions of members of the Indonesian Armed Forces and military groups responsible for human rights violations in Indonesia and East Timor. 
   These certainly are not unreasonable conditions. They work in favor of the forces of reform within Indonesia. And by linking military and security assistance to these benchmarks, Congress will ensure that the U.S. relationship with Jakarta avoids the mistakes of the past, and that U.S. foreign policy comes closer to reflecting our core national values. 
   To those who believe that all is well, to those who would prefer to forgive and forget, to those who think that the issue is yesterday's news, I would simply reiterate the simple facts. There have been no trials for the perpetrators of abuses in East Timor, and the situation in the refugee camps has remained unacceptable. Quite recently, Admiral Dennis Blair, commander in chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific, reaffirmed what Secretary of Defense Cohen articulated last year--the U.S. will not resume a military relationship with Indonesia until the military personnel responsible for the devastation in East Timor are brought to justice, and the U.S. will not resume a military relationship with Indonesia until the refugee crisis in West Timor has been resolved. Specifically, Admiral Blair called on the Indonesians to disband and cut off support to the militia members still terrorizing the refugees. It is critical that the U.S. insist on nothing less. In fact, we should insist on more--the militia members guilty of atrocities should be brought to justice. 
   It is clear that these conditions have not yet been met. But the administration's new proposals for joint exercises with the Indonesians undermine Admiral Blair's words. The substance of the exercise currently being planned does not necessarily trouble me, but its significance does. The administration looks as if it suffers from a lack of resolve and from a wavering sense of commitment. 
   Indonesia is an extraordinarily important country--strategically and economically. Its future course will undoubtedly affect the United States. For this very reason, we must stand firm, and insist upon rebuilding U.S.-Indonesian ties on the firm foundation of respect for the rule of law and for basic human rights. 
   It is because I believe this so strongly--and I know that many of my colleagues share my views--that I have come back to the floor to raise this issue again. I am keeping my promise. I am watching the situation in East and West Timor very closely, and I still do not like what I see.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Today we are debating a nomination that may be just as important to the cause of campaign finance reform as any bill that has been considered by the Senate in recent years. Tomorrow's vote on the nomination of Brad Smith may be just as significant for campaign finance reform as any of the votes we had on those bills. 
   The issue here is the nomination of Brad Smith to a 6-year term on the Federal Election Commission, and I oppose that nomination. 
   Like other speakers, I take note of the photograph of Brad Smith's family shown today on the floor only to make a point that this nomination is certainly not analogous to treatment that has been given to judicial appointments, where we have had to wait for years and years for a confirmation vote. Mr. Smith was just nominated a couple of months ago. So this has not been a long drawn out delay of his nomination that would do harm to him, his family, or anybody else. In fact, I rejected that kind of approach to his nomination because, as far as I know, Professor Smith is a perfectly reasonable man in terms of his integrity and his academic ability and the like. He deserved a vote on the floor and he is going to get it, a lot faster than many judicial nominees that President has sent to us. 
   The problem is that Professor Smith's views on Federal election laws as expressed in Law Review articles, interviews, op-eds, and speeches over the past half decade are startling. He should not be on the regulatory body charged with enforcing and interpreting those laws. 
   So when words are used on the floor such as ``vilification,'' or questioning his integrity, or any other excuse not to get to the real issue, I have to strongly object. This debate is simply on the merits of what Professor Smith's views are of what the election laws are or should be. 
   Over the course of the debate--and I note that a number of my colleagues will be joining me on the floor to set out the case against Professor Smith--we will explain, and I hope convince, our colleagues and the public that this nomination has to be defeated. 
   Let me again make it clear, because I think there was some attempt to suggest the opposite, that I hold no personal animus towards Professor Smith. It is not a matter of personality. I am sure he is a good person. I do not question his right to criticize the laws from his outside perch as a law professor and commentator. But his views on the very laws he will be called upon to enforce give rise to grave doubt as to whether he can carry out the responsibilities of a Commissioner on the FEC. It just isn't possible for us to ignore the views he has repeatedly and stridently expressed simply because he now says he will faithfully execute the laws if he is confirmed. 
   We would not accept, nor should we accept, such disclaimers from individuals nominated to head other agencies of government. Sometimes a cliche is the best way to express an idea. Professor Smith on the FEC would really be the classic case of the fox guarding the hen house. 
   Let me illustrate this by pointing out the views of Bradley Smith that caused me and many others who care about campaign finance reform to have a lot of concern about his being on the FEC. 
   Professor Smith has been a prolific scholar on the first amendment and the Federal election laws, so there is a rich written record to review. Let's start with one of his most bold statements. In a 1997 opinion in the Wall Street Journal, Professor Smith wrote the following:  
   When a law is in need of continual revision to close a series of ever changing ``loopholes,'' it is probably the law and not the people that is in error. The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal Elections Campaign Act.  
   That is right. The man who we may be about to confirm for a seat on the Federal Election Commission believes the very laws he is supposed to enforce should be repealed. Thomas Jefferson said we should have a revolution in this country every 20 years. He believed laws should constantly be revised and revisited to make sure they are responsive to the needs of citizens at any given time. Yet Professor Smith sees the need for closing a loophole in the Federal elections laws as evidence that the whole system, the whole idea of campaign finance reform laws, should be completely scrapped. In other words, what would be the purpose of the Federal Elections Commission under his view of the world? 
   A majority of both the House and the Senate have voted to close the loophole in the law known as soft money. We know that loophole is undermining public confidence in our elections and our legislative process. We have seen that loophole grow until it threatens to swallow the entire system. Many Members think it already has. A majority of the Congress wants to fix that problem. We are willing to legislate to improve an imperfect system. But Brad Smith wants to junk the system entirely and let the big money flow, without limit. 
   So what are we doing? We are about to put somebody with that view on the body charged with enforcing laws we pass. I don't think this makes any sense. 
   Another statement by Professor Smith that I think should give us pause, in a policy paper published by the Cato Institute, for whom Professor  Smith has written extensively, he says the following:  
   The Federal Election Campaign Act and its various State counterparts are profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the First Amendment.  
   Of course, this is consistent with his views that the Federal Election Campaign Act should be repealed. The FEC has loopholes and doesn't work. Not only that, it is profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the first amendment. 
   How can a member of the FEC, how can Brad Smith, reconcile those views with his new position as one of six individuals responsible for enforcing and implementing the statute and any future reforms that Congress may pass? He has shown such extreme disdain in his writings and public statements for the very law he would be charged to enforce that I just don't think he should be entrusted with this important responsibility. 
   Let me repeat, this nominee says that the Federal Election Campaign Act is profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the first amendment. Every bit of it. I am sure this body doesn't agree. Is it profoundly undemocratic to believe that the tobacco companies, the pharmaceutical companies, and the trial lawyers shouldn't be pouring money into campaigns through the parties, while they seek to influence legislation that affects their bottom lines? Is it profoundly undemocratic to believe that $20,000 per year is enough for a wealthy person to be able to contribute to a political party? Is it profoundly undemocratic to argue that the spending of outside groups to attack candidates should be reported? That the public has a right to know the identities and financial backers of groups that run vicious, negative ads against candidates just weeks before an election? 
   I, for one, take great pride in being a strong defender of the first amendment. I wouldn't vote for a bill that was ``profoundly at odds with the first amendment,'' and I don't think my colleagues, who form a majority of the Senate in support of campaign finance reform, would either. But we are being asked to confirm to a seat on the body that will implement these laws someone who views these laws and our views as totally illegitimate. 
   Professor Smith does believe, apparently, that disclosure is a good thing, but that is all the regulation he wants to see in our elections. 
   In another article, Professor Smith writes: I do think that Buckley is probably wrong in allowing contribution limits. He believes and he reaffirmed this belief in the hearings on his nomination held by the Rules Committee that contribution limits are unconstitutional. Professor Smith's view, as quoted by the Columbus Dispatch, is that people should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics. Whatever they want. He thinks there is no problem with unlimited contributions, none. Congress need not concern itself with that issue at all, apparently. In an interview at MSNBC he said: I think we should deregulate and just let it go. That is how our politics was run for over 100 years. 
   Think about what this is. We are asking somebody to enforce our election laws who says, literally, ``just let it go.'' That is some enforcement. Professor Smith would have us go back to the late 19th century before Theodore Roosevelt pushed through the 1907 Tillman Act and prohibits corporate contributions to Federal elections. 
   The limits on contributions from individuals to candidates--the very core of the campaign finance law that the Supreme Court upheld in Buckley v. Valeo and again in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC--Brad Smith would junk these provisions along with the very statute that created the FEC, the body on which he now seeks to serve. 
   Professor Smith thinks that contribution limits are expendable because, in his view, the concerns about corruption are just overblown. 
   Let's look at what Mr. Smith has to say about that: He wrote in a 1997 law review article:  
   Whatever the particulars of reform proposals, it is increasingly clear that reformers have overstated the government interest in the anticorruption rationale. Money's alleged corrupting influence are far from proven.  
   Well it just so happens, Mr. President, that the U.S. Supreme Court doesn't agree. Just a few months ago, the Supreme Court issued a ringing reaffirmation of the core holding of the Buckley decision that forms the basis for the reform effort. The Court once again held that Congress has the constitutional power to limit contributions to political campaigns in order to protect the integrity of the political process from corruption or the appearance of corruption. In upholding contribution limits imposed by the Missouri Legislature, Justice Souter wrote for the Court:  
   [T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.  
   Mr. Smith thinks the dangers of corruption are overblown. The Supreme Court says they are obvious. Professor Smith's disdain for campaign finance reform is so great that he won't even admit the most basic fact about our political life. That at some point, in some amount, contributions can corrupt. Or at least they look like they corrupt, which the Supreme Court recognized is just as good a reason to limit contributions to politicians. The appearance of corruption, Mr. President. We all know it's there. We hear it from our constituents regularly. We see it in the press, we hear about it on the news. But Brad Smith says the corrupting effect of money on the legislative process is far from proven. 
   Back home if I said that at any town meeting that is a laugh line. Americans scoff at the notion that big money is not corrupting our system.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, although this, too, is an uphill battle, it is a good feeling to be on the floor again with my good friend, the Senator from Arizona, not only to fight this nomination, but also to signal the fact that we are ready to move forward on the campaign finance issue and a ban on soft money. 
   I think the debate today has turned out to be not only a good chance to review the inappropriateness of the Bradley Smith nomination, but to review what has happened this year on the campaign finance front, particularly the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Shrink Missouri case, and of course, more importantly, the tremendous profile the Senator from Arizona has given to the campaign finance issue through his courageous campaign for President. 
   All of that is optimistic for the future. But today we have to continue the battle, as the Senator from Arizona has done, to try to prevent the Senate from making a terrible mistake with regard to the Federal Election Commission. 
   In that regard, let me first elaborate on one item the Senator from Kentucky addressed. Earlier today, the Senator from Kentucky quoted from a number of letters from law professors, allegedly in support of the nomination of Professor Brad Smith. One of those letters was from Burt Neuborne, a professor at NYU Law School and Legal Director at the Brennan Center for Justice, somebody for whom I have tremendous regard and respect. The Senator from Kentucky took great pleasure in quoting that letter because the Brennan Center has been very effective and outspoken in its opposition to Professor Smith. 
   I was a little surprised by the quote the Senator from Kentucky read from Professor Neuborne, although I noted that Professor Neuborne didn't seem to endorse Professor Smith for the FEC post in the portion of his letter the Senator from Kentucky read. 
   In the interim, I asked my staff to look into the letter. Although we have not actually seen a copy, it seems the letter quoted by the Senator from Kentucky on the floor was actually a letter in support of Professor Smith's effort to get tenure at his law school a few years ago. I hope I don't need to point out, Mr. President, that there is a big difference between tenure at a law school and a seat on the FEC. Law professors can be and often are provocative, even outrageous, in their views, but FEC Commissioners have to enforce and interpret the law as intended by Congress. It is a very different job from being a professor. 
   So I want the Record to be clear. Professor Neuborne's comments were quoted at least a bit out of context, and those comments had nothing to do with the decision that will soon be before the Senate on Professor Smith's nomination. 
   Now let me say a bit more about the nomination and its relationship to the issue of soft money, which the Senator from Arizona was addressing moments ago. I spoke earlier about some of the views of Brad Smith on our current election laws. Now I want to talk about his views on the major reform issue that faces the Congress this year, the proposed ban on soft money. 
   Professor Smith believes a ban such as the one contained in the McCain-Feingold bill would be unconstitutional. That is another reason I believe he should not be confirmed. 
   We have had a number of debates on the issue of campaign finance reform in the last few years. They have been hard fought and sometimes illuminating. Particularly interesting to me, I have noticed very frequently the arguments of opponents of reform have changed over time. The first few times the McCain-Feingold bill was brought to the floor, much of the argument was against the spending limits and benefits contained in the original bill. We heard the cry of ``welfare for politicians,'' over and over. 
   Then, when the bill was modified and spending limits for candidates were dropped, opponents of reform focused on provisions 
   that would have restricted the use of unlimited corporate and union money to pay for phony issue ads that were really nothing more than campaign ads in disguise. Opponents complained that these provisions violated the first amendment. Then the accusation on this floor over and over again became that we reformers were the so-called ``speech police'' and the ``enemies of free speech.'' 
   Last fall, however, Senator MCCAIN and I decided to exclusively focus our attention on the worst loophole in the law, the problem that has undermined the whole of our Nation's election laws, the unlimited soft money contributions to the political parties. We found few, if any, opponents who were actually willing to come to the floor during the latest debate to continue to press some kind of a constitutional attack on this bill. 
   The reason was very simple. There is no credible argument that a ban on soft money would be struck down by the Supreme Court. That view was supported by a letter to Senator MCCAIN and to me from 126 legal scholars. It was seconded by a letter from every living former president, executive director, legal director, and legislative director of the American Civil Liberties Union. Even one of the strongest and most consistent opponents of reform in this body, the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, conceded on the floor that a ban on soft money is probably constitutional. He even conceded that. 
   Then we had the Supreme Court weighing in earlier this year in the Shrink Missouri case, reaffirming a portion of the Buckley decision that upheld contribution limits and stating in very strong and clear language that the Congress has the power to limit contributions to protect against actual or apparent corruption, the Court said:  
   There is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.  
   In my view, and I think in the view of any serious commentator on this subject, the Supreme Court's ruling in the Shrink Missouri case removes all doubt as to whether the Court would uphold the constitutionality of a ban on soft money. That is the centerpiece of the reform bill that has passed the House and is now awaiting Senate action. It is simply not credible to argue  that this same Court that just a couple of months ago so strongly upheld the Missouri contribution limits would somehow completely change its jurisprudence and turn around and strike down an act of Congress that would outlaw soft money. It is simply not credible. 
   But then there is Bradley Smith, the nominee before the Senate. In a paper for the Notre Dame Law School Journal of Legislation, published in 1998, he wrote the following:  
   Regardless of what one thinks about soft money, or what one thinks about the applicable Supreme Court precedents, a blanket ban on soft money would be, under clear, well-established First Amendment doctrine, constitutionally infirm.  
   Professor Smith makes the argument that since the parties use soft money to run phony issue ads and since phony issue ads are constitutionally protected, somehow a ban on soft money must be constitutionally suspect. 
   The problem with this argument is that the justification for banning soft money has nothing to do with stopping the parties from running phony issue ads. The purpose of a soft money ban is to stop the erosion of public confidence in the political process that unlimited contributions from wealthy corporate, labor, and individual donors have caused--in other words, to put it in simple terms, terms that are not my own but those of the U.S. Supreme Court, to stop the appearance of corruption. 
   Banning soft money is not about attacking speech, it is about attacking corruption. The parties can continue to run all the phony issue ads they want after soft money is banned; they will just have to use hard money to pay for those ads. 
   Of course, Professor Smith doesn't agree that unlimited contributions can cause a corruption problem. But the Supreme Court most certainly does. 
   A majority of this Senate has voted repeatedly in favor of a soft money ban. I cannot imagine that same majority will, tomorrow, vote to confirm a nominee who believes such a ban is unconstitutional. 
   That is why the vote on Mr. Smith is not simply a vote on an executive branch nominee, it is a vote on campaign finance reform 
   Here is the problem. If we succeed in passing a soft money ban this year, the FEC is going to have to promulgate regulations to implement that law. Numerous questions will undoubtedly arise on the mechanics of that ban. We need an FEC that will vote to enforce the law and to interpret it in a way that is consistent with congressional intent. I simply have no confidence that Mr. Smith will be able do that--how can he? It would be completely at odds with his own loudly professed principles. His view is that the whole exercise of prohibiting the parties from soliciting and receiving unlimited non-federal contributions is illegitimate.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President I rise today to honor the dean of the congressional print reporters here in Congress. Frank A. Aukofer has worked in the Washington Bureau of the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel and its predecessor, the Milwaukee Journal, since 1970. Frank has also served in other capacities for the paper since 1960. Sadly, for those of us who have read his stories through the years, Frank has decided to retire at the beginning of next month. 
   During his long and distinguished career, Frank has reported on the issues that have defined the last 40 years in America and around the world. He was the civil rights reporter for the Journal at the height of the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Since arriving in Washington, Frank's coverage of State, national, and international issues has included stories on six Presidents, 15 Congresses, and the nomination hearings of 11 Supreme Court justices, including every member of the current Court. 
   Coverage of these important events has not kept Frank tied to his desk here in the press gallery. In the 1980s, he traveled to Mexico, Colombia, Cuba, and Central America to cover such stories as the trial of Eugene Hasenfus in Nicaragua which led to a nomination for a Pulitzer Prize. He was also one of the first journalists to report from Saudi Arabia in 1990 when U.S. troops were deployed after Iraq invaded Kuwait. On top of all this he has still found time to write a weekly automobile review column entitled, ``DriveWays.'' 
   I thank Frank Aukofer for his years of service to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, and the people of Wisconsin and I wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Levin amendment and in support of the Warner-Byrd amendment to the military construction appropriations bill. 
   The Warner-Byrd amendment to the Military Construction Appropriations bill. The Warner-Byrd amendment, which was accepted in committee, would require Congressional authorization for the continued presence of U.S. troops in Kosovo beyond July 1, 2001. In other words, it would require this Congress, finally, to debate and to decide on the issue of U.S. troops in Kosovo, as I believe that we are required to do under the War Powers Resolution. 
   I am sure that some opponents of this measure will paint a picture of a power-hungry Congress, eager to wrest authorities away from the executive in an attempt to gain leverage over the White House. 
   But this is about more than power, Mr. President. It is about responsibility. Approximately 5,900 U.S. troops are currently serving in an apparently open-ended operation in Kosovo. Fifty-  nine hundred Americans are operating in often dangerous conditions in the pursuit of a policy that this Congress has not authorized. Fifty-nine hundred families are sacrificing. We cannot continue to suggest to the American people, to our constituents, that this is none of our business. Congressional approval is essential to the commitment of U.S. troops in dangerous situations abroad. 
   Still other opponents of this measure paint a grim picture of the consequences that will follow should Congress insist on authorizing a large-scale deployment like that in Kosovo. Because they believe that Congress would act irresponsibly, they prefer that Congress not act at all. 
   Again, this is a simply unacceptable abdication of responsibility. What does it say about the state of the this body that we do not trust ourselves to make tough decisions? What kind of leadership do we exercise when we dodge accountability for a policy of such critical importance to this country? 
   The decision that this legislation would force upon the Congress--a decision to either remain in or withdraw from Kosovo--is exactly the kind of choice that we are here to make. It, Mr. President, is our responsibility. I urge my colleagues to shoulder it with care, as fifty-nine hundred dedicated men and women are counting on us to do our duty. 
   The Warner-Byrd amendment would also mandate the burden-sharing that was supposed to be at the heart of the U.S. approach to Kosovo. The U.S. bore the lion's share of the burden in NATO's military campaign of last year. I did not agree with that policy; I believed then and I believe now that the leading role was Europe's to fill. But I was heartened by the promise that Europe would take the lead when it came to securing the peace, and that Europe, and not America, would provide the vast majority of the resources required to meet Kosovo's enormous needs. 
   There have been a lot of suggestions that this legislation does a lot more than it actually does. 
   All this legislation does, Mr. President, is hold our valued friends and allies to their word. Kosovo's reconstruction and return to civil authority cannot be allowed to become a U.S.-led project. Certainly, Mr. President, while the U.S. fails to intervene in equally compelling crises around the globe, we make the case--and it is, in my view, a very strong case--for regional leadership in regional conflicts. African solutions to African problems--that is often our prescription for the conflicts and challenges of that troubled continent. In East Timor, we stood back, allowed a regional force led by Australia to take the lead, and then played a supporting role in that effort. This, Mr. President, is the most promising recipe for U.S. engagement in the world today. And it should be followed when it comes to Kosovo. 
   But there have been problems, Mr. President, with the timely delivery of Europe's pledges. This amendment makes the U.S. position crystal clear--our allies must fulfill their responsibilities if they are to continue to count on U.S. support. This is the right message and the right thing to do, and Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will remember how right this is the next time the tables are turned and it is our country that is failing to honor our international commitments, be it at the U.N. or elsewhere. 
   So I urge my colleagues to face up to our shared responsibility when it comes to the U.S. involvement in Kosovo, and to insist that our allies do the same. The fifty-nine hundred American men and women in Kosovo cannot dodge reality or duck responsibility. Neither should our European allies, and neither should we. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak with regard to the MOTION TO PROCEED and share my concerns that we should not be moving to an ``S'' numbered appropriations bill at this time. In fact, it is a practice simply we should not be involved in at all. For this reason I rise to speak for a bit about care for the Senate in general. 
   The Senate is a special place. It is a place steeped in history. Around this chamber stand the desks of Daniel Webster and Robert LaFollette, of Robert Taft and Richard Russell, of Everett Dirksen and Hubert Humphrey. The drawers of these desks still bear their names, etched in the wood. The polished mahogany still reflects their memory. Their voices still echo from these marble walls. 
   I am honored to have been able to serve with some of the Senate's living legends. It is with pride that I will tell my grandchildren that I worked with the likes of TED KENNEDY, Bob Dole, and ROBERT BYRD. No honest history of the Senate will omit their names. 
   It is in a modest attempt to follow in the tradition of remarks by Senator BYRD that I rise today. All Senators are aware of Senator BYRD's encyclopedic four-volume treatise on the Senate. And none can forget the series of addresses that Senator BYRD gave on the history of the Roman Senate, which have been reprinted in another volume. His discussions of the special nature of the Senate inspire us all to hold this institution more dearly. 
   The Senate is an almost sacred place, consecrated by the will of the people, hallowed by the expression of the people in free elections. In this room, our 50 separate States each find expression. Every region of our vast continental nation here finds voice. 
   In a country as large and as diverse as ours, disputes will naturally arise. The Senate, almost like a court of law, provides a means for our society to resolve those disputes in peace. Courts allow private parties to resolve their disputes without resort to fist fights. And the Senate allows significant sections of our society to resolve their disputes without resort to the battlefield or the street. 
   For the Senate, as for a court of law, to work this magic, it must do justice. As with a court, as Gordon Hewart, the Lord Chief Justice of Great Britain, wrote, it is:  
   Of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.  
   For the Senate, as for a court of law, to advance the perception of justice and the fair resolution of disputes, it must air disagreements fully. It must give opposing parties their day. It must allow all to approach on an equal footing and make their case. 
   Justice is not cursory. Justice is not offhand. Doing justice can take time. That is how the Founders wanted this great system to work. 
   In the debates of the Constitutional Convention, James Madison said of the Senate:  
   In order to judge of the form to be given to this institution, it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by it. These were first to protect the people against their rulers: secondly to protect the people against the transient impressions into which they themselves might be led.  
   Madison warned that the people's representatives might be ``liable to err also, from fickleness and passion.'' Madison's answer was that Senators, because of their ``limited number, and firmness[,] might seasonably interpose against impetuous counsels.'' He thus called the Senate: ``A necessary fence against this danger.'' 
   Time and again, in the history of our country, the Senate has served as that ``necessary 
   fence.'' And the firm pillars and posts supporting that fence have been the Senate Rules. The Senate Rules have helped the Senate to do justice. It is because of the Senate Rules that the British Prime Minister William Gladstone is said to have called the Senate: 
   That remarkable body, the most remarkable of all the inventions of modern politics.  
   The Senate Rules make it one of the few places in government where disagreements can be fully aired. The Senate Rules give opposing parties their day. And the Senate Rules allow every Senator to make his or her case. 
   As Senator Dole said in his speech in the Leader's Lecture Series March 28:  
   We all continue to learn that this institution can only survive if it operates by rules.  
   The two fundamental pillars of those rules are the right to debate and the right to amend. It is these rights that distinguish the Senate from the House of Representatives and from other parliaments. It is these rights of Senators that allow the Senate as a body to preserve the rights of minorities. 
   Rule XIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate provides that ``the Presiding Officer shall recognize the Senator who shall first address him.''  Precedent, of course, gives priority of recognition to the Leaders. Once the Presiding Officer has recognized a Senator, Senate rule XXII allows that Senator to speak for as long as humanly possible, unless 60 Senators vote to cut off debate. As my Colleagues well know, the mere threat of extended debate--called a ``hold''--can detain legislation. 
   As well, the Senate Rules give Senators the right to offer amendments. The Senate Rules do not require Senators to go hat-in-hand to a leadership-dominated Rules Committee to ask permission to offer an amendment, as Members of Congress must do in the House of Representatives. This ability to bring up a subject with which the majority does not want to deal provides a check and balance on the agenda-setting power that is vested in the majority leader. 
   These powers to debate and amend make every single Senator a force to be reckoned with. Every Senator--whether a member of the majority or the minority--can be a player. And Leadership cannot neglect or exclude any single Senator without substantial risk. As a result, Senators do well never to burn bridges with any other Senator. Because any one Senator can disrupt the Senate, every Senator has good reason to show comity for every other Senator. 
   These rules honor the sentiments of committed minorities. They give dedicated groups of Senators substantial power. And they give any group of 41 Senators the absolute right to kill a bill. 
   The Senate Rules thereby force consensus. When these rules are honored, no major change in our government's laws may come about without the concurrence of a three-fifths majority. When these rules are honored, policy changes are likely to be more moderate and more incremental. 
   As Nobel Prize-winning economist James Buchanan has argued, societal efficiency may be served by a Congress that has a hard time enacting laws. Under such circumstances, laws change less often--less frequently disrupting peoples' lives, less often intruding into them. If you agree with Thoreau that the best government is that which governs least, then the most efficient government for society is the one with the most checks and balances. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate is not honoring its rules. The Senate is breaching its longstanding traditions of comity and respect for the minority. Too often, in the name of expediency, today's Senate is cutting corners on the Senate rules. When we give in to expediency it can be disappointing. When we indulge in expediency in this, the place where deliberation is most sacred, it can be deplorable. 
   Although some of the trends of which I speak have, of course, their roots in past Senates and other majorities, the Senate's current majority has brought the level of honor for the Senate's unique ideals to a new low. 
   The current majority has diminished the Senate by abusing and overusing cloture. The application of the rules of cloture have changed dramatically since President Woodrow Wilson, infuriated by an 11-Senator filibuster that blocked the rearming of merchant ships during World War I, complained of ``[a] little group of willful men, representing no opinion but their own,'' who he said ``have rendered the great government of the United States helpless and contemptible.'' 
   Cloture used to be a rarity. The Senate conducted only 45 rollcall votes on cloture in the entire half century from 1919 to 1969. 
   In 1975, the Senate changed the filibuster rule, reducing the two-thirds vote requirement to a vote of 60 Senators, although one still needs two-thirds to cut off debate on changes to Senate rules. With that change in the rules, the leadership began invoking cloture more frequently. 
   As the chart behind me shows, the process of invoking cloture has now reached what I call a fevered pitch. The Senate conducted 99 rollcall votes on cloture in the 1970s. It conducted 138 in the entire decade of the 1980s, and it conducted fully 234 in the 1990s. 
   As this next chart shows, the number of cloture votes has increased in every year of the current majority, nearly doubling, from roughly 20 in 1995 to nearly 40 in 1999. 
   Even by 1984, a select committee on procedure chaired by then-Senator Dan Quayle concluded: ``Cloture is not only invoked too often, it is invoked too soon.'' Senator Quayle's criticism is all the more true today. In the Congress when Senator Quayle made his remark, the 98th Congress, there had by this time been 10 rollcall votes on cloture motions. In the comparable time period in this 106th Congress, we have held more than four times as many--43 rollcall votes on cloture. Add to that another 11 cloture motions that were withdrawn, vitiated, or otherwise disposed of without a vote. 
   As Senator Quayle noted, the problem with cloture is not just how often, but when. The form of a motion to invoke cloture reads: ``We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, hereby move to bring to a close the debate'' upon the bill. 
   But on bill after bill, from tax cuts to trade bills to constitutional amendments, the majority no longer tolerates even a day's worth of debate before moving ``to bring to a close the debate'' upon the bill. Indeed, filing cloture without any debate has now become the norm. We proceed to the bill and the cloture motion is filed in the time that it takes the majority leader to draw one breath and make the request. 
   As an example, I have a chart that shows the entire verbatim transcript of the debate on the motion to proceed to S. 2285, the gas tax bill, prior to the filing of cloture. The ``debate''--if you would call it that--was the 11 words the majority leader uttered to make the motion to proceed. In the same breath, the cloture motion was upon us. 
   The practice of filing cloture without any debate at all has made a mockery of the motion. 
   Beyond limiting debate, the majority is also using the blunt instrument of cloture to bludgeon the minority into forgoing its right to offer amendments. All too often, the majority leader now makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the minority leader: Either muzzle your right to amendment or we will paint you as obstructionist. Either clear your amendments with us in advance, or have no amendments at all. 
   I am afraid too often, the minority's leadership can get caught up in the business of helping the majority make the trains run on time, in a sense, playing the role of Alec Guinness's Colonel Nicholson in ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' building bridges that should not be built. 
   This is not how the Senate was meant to act. 
   Recall that the Senate has often addressed a number of amendments on a single piece of legislation. The Senate conducted 121 rollcall votes on amendments to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It conducted 127 rollcall votes on the Natural Gas Policy Act in 1977. Now the idea that a bill might elicit more than ten amendments appears to be anathema to the majority. 
   The current majority has also diminished the Senate by changing the rule that limits what can be incorporated into a conference report. Late in 1996, to secure last-minute passage of a version of the Federal Aviation Authorization Act that included a special provision for the Federal Express Corporation, the Senate voted 56-39 to overturn the Chair and nullify the rule. At the time, Senator SPECTER called the change ``a very, very serious perversion of Senate procedures.'' 
   As conference reports are privileged, Senators cannot engage in extended debate to block getting to them. As well, conference reports are not open to amendment. And after the 1996 precedent, Senators have no recourse if a conference committee exceeds the scope of what the Senate committed to it. 
   The majority in a conference committee need not work with the minority, and the majority often does not. Conference committees usually work in secret. Senate rules require no open meetings. House practice has generally required one such meeting, but that tends to be a photo opportunity. Thereafter, Senators' signatures on the conference report constitute their votes, and nothing further need be done in public. 
   Last July, the Democratic leader offered an amendment to restore the rule with regard to conference reports, but the majority would not allow it. The  majority voted it down 51-47 in a nearly party-line vote. 
   The current majority has also diminished the Senate by extending and contorting the congressional budget process far beyond any expectations that its drafters may have had. 
   Once again, of course, the roots of the current abuse of the budget process lie in earlier Congresses. Participants in the Federal budget process initially underestimated the power of the budget process. They failed completely, however, to foresee the power of reconciliation bills. 
   The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 originally provided for two budget resolutions: The first would advise, and the second, passed closer to the start of the fiscal year, would bind. The Budget Act provided that the second budget resolution could instruct committees of Congress to reconcile substantive laws passed within their 
   jurisdiction over the summer to the new priorities of the second budget resolution. 
   Of course, the reconciliation process has not turned out that modestly. Rather, in 1981, in an effort to expedite President Reagan's first budget, the budget resolution included instructions for years beyond the first fiscal year covered by the resolution, extending the reach of reconciliation bills to more permanent changes in law. 
   Since then, reconciliation has become a regular feature of most budget resolutions. Since then, Congress has accomplished most significant deficit reduction through the reconciliation process. 
   Because reconciliation bills limit debate, Senators cannot filibuster them. A simple majority can pass their policies. Because reconciliation limits amendments, Senators must stick to only the narrow subjects chosen by the majority in the committee process. 
   The reconciliation process is so powerful that the Senate chose in the mid-1980s to adopt the Byrd Rule, named after Senator ROBERT BYRD, to limit reconciliation solely to deficit reduction. 
   But the current majority dramatically extended reconciliation in 1996. The new Republican Congress sought to move three reconciliation bills--on welfare, Medicare, and tax cuts. And in a marked departure from past practice, the budget that year devoted one of the three reconciliation bills--the one to cut taxes--solely to worsening the deficit, not cutting the deficit but making it worse. 
   The Democratic leader formally challenged the procedure, but to no avail. Through a series of exchanges with the Presiding Officer, the Democratic leader demonstrated that the new reconciliation procedure has few limits. After the Democratic leader appealed the ruling of the Chair, the Senate sustained the procedure on a straight party-line vote. 
   In the wake of that precedent, the majority party has repeatedly created reconciliation bills to worsen the deficit or spend the surplus by cutting taxes, and the same logic would allow fast-track reconciliation bills to increase spending. The majority has taken to using the reconciliation process to move its fiscal legislative agenda through the Senate with simple majority votes and few distractions. The result is plain to see: Congress passes extravagant tax bills that do not command a national consensus and that cannot become law. 
   As well, in this most recently-adopted budget resolution, the majority has even chosen by majority vote to require 60 votes to offer sense-of-the-Senate amendments to future budget resolutions. Though by no means an earth-shaking change in and of itself, it shows yet another instance of how the majority abuses majority-vote vehicles to create yet another variance from the Standing Rules of the Senate. Once again, the current majority seeks to muzzle debate. 
   The current majority has also diminished the Senate by bringing S.-numbered appropriations bills to the floor. 
   That is what is happening right now. That is what prompted, in part, these remarks. The majority wants to go to these S.-numbered appropriations bills. They want to do it on the foreign ops bill. 
   The Senate just considered the military construction appropriations bill as a Senate-numbered bill, not--as is usually the case with appropriations bills--a House bill with Senate Committee-reported amendments. And what does this do? It has a purpose. This posture deprives Senators of the ability to offer legislative amendments. It is yet another way to deny the duly elected Members of this body a chance to offer amendments--an absolutely basic right of every Senator. 
   Not infrequently, the House chooses to attach legislation to an appropriations measure. In that case, if as is usually done, the Senate considers the House bill with Senate amendments, a Senator can also offer amendments with legislative language. If another Senator raises a point of order under rule XVI against legislating on the appropriation bill, the amendment's 
   proponent can raise the defense of germaneness. The idea is that the House opened the door to legislation on this appropriations bill, and the Senate must be able to respond with germane amendments. 
   If, on the other hand, as is being attempted here, the Senate takes up a Senate-numbered appropriations bill, as it did with the military construction bill, then there is no House bill to provide a basis for the defense of germaneness. Under this circumstance, if a Senator offers a legislative amendment and another Senator raises a point of order against legislating on an appropriation bill, then the Chair simply rules the amendment out of order and the amendment falls. The Senator does not have a chance, again, to offer an amendment. 
   Through this device, the majority once again deprives the minority of opportunities to legislate. As well, the majority deprives the full Senate of its ability to respond to riders that the House attaches to appropriations bills. Once again, the majority has diminished the deliberation of the Senate. 
   And now, we see the spectacle of the majority standing ready to shut down the Senate for over 4 hours, as they did, on Tuesday, just to prevent a sense-of-the-Senate vote on gun safety. 
   And now, we see the majority leader appealing the ruling of the Chair, and by a majority vote, changing the Standing Rules of the Senate, so as to have the Presiding Officer rule out of order nongermane amendments to appropriations bills. 
   This in itself was a remarkable thing. Rule XVI, which creates the prohibition against nongermane amendments, states in part:  
   [A]ll questions of relevancy of amendments under this rule, when raised, shall be submitted to the Senate and be decided without debate.  
   And as my colleagues know, it takes a two-thirds vote to invoke cloture on a change to the Senate rules. But by a party-line, majority vote Wednesday, the Senate just erased those words from the Standing Rules of the Senate. And why? For the same reason all these other things were done--all to make it more difficult for Senators to offer amendments on appropriations bills. 
   What has become of our right to debate? What has become of our right to amend? 
   The traditional Senate, I am afraid, is becoming a thing of the past. I have seen this change just from the time I got here in 1993 to now. Some may say, ``Good riddance.'' After all, as a Democratic Member of Congress once said, ``In the Senate, you can't go to the bathroom without 60 votes.'' 
   But the character of this Senate, I am afraid, has been unmistakably altered. The majority's actions are transforming the Senate into a much more majoritarian institution. And that is not how the founders wanted it. 
   Recall that the Constitution itself manifests a belief in supermajorities. Supermajority requirements are evident in the veto power, in the ratification of treaties, in the constitutional amendment process, and in a number of other places. 
   Recall, as well, that the founders who created this Senate also expressed a healthy distrust of simple majority rule. 
   James Madison said that:  
   [i]n Republics, the great danger is, that the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority.  
   In a letter to James Monroe, Madison also wrote:  
   There is no maxim, in my opinion, which is more liable to be misapplied, and which, therefore, more needs elucidation, than the current one, that the interest of the majority is the political standard of right and wrong.   
   In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson said: 
   Though the will of the majority is ..... to prevail, that will, to be rightful, must be reasonable. ..... The Minority possess their equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and to violate which would be oppression. 
   And John Adams wrote:  
   That the desires of the majority of the people are often for injustice and inhumanity against the minority, is demonstrated by every page of the history of the whole world.  
   More recently, Senator J. William Fulbright said:  
   The greatest single virtue of a strong legislature is not what it can do but what it can prevent.  
   In 1984, retiring Congressman Barber Conable told Time Magazine: ``Congress is `functioning the way the founding fathers intended--not very well.' He explain[ed], `They understood that if you move too quickly, our democracy will be less responsible to the majority. I don't think it's the function of Congress to function well. It should drag its heels on the way to decision.' '' 
   And Senator BYRD, who has stood on both the giving and receiving end of many a filibuster, writes in his Senate history:  
   The Senate is the only forum in the government where the perfection of laws may be unhurried and where controversial decisions may be hammered out on the anvil of lengthy debate. The liberties of a free people will always be safe where a forum exists in which open and unlimited debate is allowed.  
   For all their inconvenience, the Senate traditions of deliberation and amendment serve our Nation. It is through those traditions that the Senate protects liberty. It is through those traditions that the Senate can effect justice. 
   When we stand and look back at the Senate's glorious history, we can be forgiven when we do not measure up to the standards of our greatest predecessors. We cannot be forgiven--and we should not be forgiven--when so often we do not even care to try. 
   We can be forgiven if, after considering the traditions of the Senate's hallowed past, we choose to depart from those traditions. We can not be forgiven--and we should not be forgiven--if we depart from those traditions unaware or oblivious of what we leave behind. 
   I invite my colleagues to look around this Senate Chamber, to read the inscriptions in the marble reliefs over the doors. To the east is written ``Patriotism.'' To the west is inscribed ``Courage.'' And to the south is carved ``Wisdom.'' 
   These are the icons under which we walk whenever we come into this Chamber and whenever we leave it. These walls do not speak of ``ease.'' The marble does not memorialize ``rapidity.'' These sculptures do not enshrine ``convenience.'' 
   This Senate advances the love of country that is patriotism when it struggles to deliver justice. The Senate serves the people not when it avoids difficult issues but when it acts with courage to address them fully. And it is only through the crucible of debate and amendment that this Senate can come, as come it must, to wisdom. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota for his efforts on each and every issue I tried to raise to try to constantly point out that this place is supposed to be where we can deliberate and actually talk about these issues and offer amendments. He is probably the best example of a person who understands the need to do that.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand. What the Senator did was absolutely essential. We need to get out here and talk about what is happening. 
   I remember when I first came here. The Senator from Minnesota was here several years before I was--I believe two. But I remember when we were in the majority, Senators on the other side were allowed to freely amend bills. 
   I learned a great deal from my colleagues, the Senators on the other side. When they offered an amendment, I sometimes agreed with them. Usually I wouldn't. I learned a great deal about what they were thinking, and about what my constituents might think. I, in particular, give credit to the Senator from Texas, Senator GRAMM. He is a superb Senator in terms of his ability. For us to be deprived because of this kind of a process of benefiting from the knowledge and thinking and sentiments of our colleagues on the other side is a terrible loss to the Senate. I have not been here that long, but I remember when it used to be different that it was better.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Again, Mr. President, looking back over the last several years, I have worked a great deal on agriculture issues, 
   as well, and I remember these kinds of meetings and being able to honestly say to a group of farmers I didn't know if we were going to be able to pass a bill. But I could say there was a decent chance to be able to bring it up on the floor, either as a bill or as an amendment. Maybe we would win; maybe we would lose. 
   It is an odd feeling now to tell a bunch of farmers that we are not allowed to offer amendments anymore. They look at you as if you have lost your mind. But that is what we have to tell them. We aren't allowed anymore in the Senate to bring up ideas and have amendments and have bills because they have to be cleared with the majority leader. We have to show him the amendment first. If he doesn't like it, we can't offer it. I try to be candid with people. That is a candid comment. That is truly different from the way things were. And I have served both in the majority and in the minority in the short years that I have been here.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. If he will yield for a question, I suggest to the Senator that if I tell a group of my constituents that I cannot find a vehicle, they would offer me a ride. They would say: Do your job; here is your ride. That is the problem. 
   I ask the Senator if he would agree, if we are forced to talk to our constituents about the minutia of Senate procedure, and if that is the kind of conversation we have to have with our dairy farmers in Wisconsin instead of talking to them about what we should be talking about, the substance of the legislation--let us worry about the Senate procedure--then really the opponents of any kind of change have won because that is not something they should have to concern themselves with. It is very interesting; great. But that is not what dairy farmers in 
   Wisconsin need. They have some great ideas about how to do things differently, and we should be able to come out here and have an amendment or a bill. 
   In fact, I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he would agree with this. We are not used to getting a lot of votes sometimes. Sometimes we don't get many votes on our amendments. Sometimes there is a little laughter about how WELLSTONE and FEINGOLD only got 10 or 12 votes. But at least we got a chance to get some votes.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I suggest that is one way that a person can come to the conclusion that the Senate should operate this way. However, there are others who would believe that government sometimes has to stop things that are bad that other levels of government or perhaps the other body would want done. 
   I ask the Senator if he does not agree that the Senate has a role from another philosophical point of view; I think it is called the ``saucer'' that THOMAS Jefferson spoke of, the saucer that goes with the cup in order to cool the Senate. 
   Whether this reflects a belief that government does not have a function, or whether it reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Senate is supposed to be, I wonder if the Senator would react.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the crisis facing our criminal justice system. For the first time since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty almost a quarter century ago, there is an increasing recognition, from both death penalty supporters and opponents, that the administration of capital punishment in our country has reached a crisis stage. 
   Our criminal justice system is fraught with errors and the risk that an innocent person may be condemned to die. Since 1976, there have been over 600 executions in the United States. But during this same period, 87 people who were sentenced to death were later proven innocent. That means for every seven persons executed, our criminal justice system has found an innocent person was wrongly condemned to die. The system by which we impose the sentence of death is rife with errors, inadequate legal representation of defendants and racial disparities. At the same time, Congress, state legislatures and the courts have curtailed appellate review of capital convictions. 
   With declining crime rates and a world where our closest allies have increasingly shunned capital punishment, a growing number of Americans--both opponents and supporters of the death penalty--are realizing that something must be done. Indeed, momentum for a moratorium on executions has been building for some time. In 1997, the American Bar Association called for a moratorium on executions. Numerous city and local governments have followed the ABA's lead by passing resolutions urging a moratorium on executions. Governor George Ryan, a death penalty proponent, has acknowledged that fatal flaws exist in the criminal justice system in Illinois and earlier this year effectively put a halt to executions in his state while a blue ribbon panel reviews his state's criminal justice system. Christian Coalition founder and death penalty supporter, the Reverend Pat Robertson, also recently proclaimed his support for a moratorium. 
   Today, on the heels of this activity, the New Hampshire state legislature earlier today took a historic step that is indicative of the deepening public  concern about the accuracy and fairness of the use of the death penalty. New Hampshire has had a provision for 
   the death penalty on its books for almost ten years. Over two months ago, the lower chamber of the New Hampshire legislature passed a bill that would repeal the death penalty. Earlier today, the New Hampshire Senate followed the House's lead and passed a bill to abolish the death penalty. This marks the first time since the late 1970's that a state legislature has passed legislation to abolish the death penalty, and I urge Governor Shaheen to let the will of the legislature stand. The New Hampshire legislature's action is particularly remarkable because it comes at the same time that the pace of executions has been accelerating in this country. Last year, we hit an all-time high for executions in any one year since 1976, 98 executions. This year, we are on track to execute at least 100 people. 
   The action of the New Hampshire legislature and long-time death penalty supporters like Governor Ryan and Reverend Pat Robertson indicates that our nation is beginning to re-think its longstanding support for capital punishment. When an auto manufacturer produces a vehicle with a bad fuel tank or malfunctioning airbags that risks injury or death to passengers, we push to have that product recalled, thoroughly review the problem and don't allow the vehicle back on the road until the problem is solved. Like a defective automobile, it is time for a recall on the death penalty. It is time to suspend executions nationwide while we review our criminal justice system to understand why so many innocents have been condemned to death row and to ensure that our justice system is a truly just system. 
   A bill I introduced just a few weeks ago does just that. The National Death Penalty moratorium Act would place a moratorium on executions nationwide while a national, blue ribbon commission reviews the administration of capital punishment. When Americans, both death penalty supporters and opponents, take a moment to consider the flaws in our criminal justice system, they can reasonably reach only one conclusion: the system is broken and must be fixed. I encourage my colleagues to join me in calling for a nationwide moratorium. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to call for Senate action on reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court in its decision in United States versus Morrison struck a specific provision from the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. But that decision leaves intact the bulk of this landmark law. For the past five years, VAWA has funded and promoted significant innovations in federal, state and local programs to assist victims of violence, enhance prosecution of domestic violence and sexual assault crimes, and prevent violence against women and children in their homes and on our streets. This support has enabled shelters, rape crisis centers, health care professionals, schools, police forces and communities across the country to address and prevent violence against women. I commend my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN, for his authorship of the original Violence Against Women Act and for his commitment to ensuring that this important legislation is re-authorized. 
   Women across the nation, including in my home state of Wisconsin, have benefitted from this important legislation. Women's lives have been saved. Countless victims of domestic violence or sexual assault are receiving the services they need. Police are participating in training programs to arrest and bring abusers to justice. Both men and women are learning about the problem of domestic violence and sexual assault. In short, women are safer today because of this legislation. 
   Our nation's progress in preventing violence against women, however, is now in serious jeopardy. Authorization for the Violence Against Women Act ends this year. I understand that Senators BIDEN and HATCH have been working closely to craft a compromise re-authorization bill. I commend both of my colleagues for their commitment to this issue. But with only weeks remaining in this abbreviated session, I urge the Senate leadership to take action on this legislation without further delay.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, for his assistance in getting this legislation to the floor. I concur with Senator HATCH that a negative inference should not be drawn from the fact that the bill was amended to remove reference to a specific organization. Given that there is reason to believe that the federal government has little, if any, remaining records of which Lao and Hmong participated in the U.S. Secret Army, I think it is entirely reasonable for the Attorney General to consider documentation provided by the Lao Veterans of America or other Lao or Hmong veterans' organizations. In fact, I understand that the Lao Veterans of America was named in the House legislation because it has maintained extensive records of the Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today will pass H.R. 371, the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act. I was proud to join my colleague from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, as an original co-sponsor of S. 890, which was companion legislation to H.R. 371. I commend Senator WELLSTONE for his leadership on this issue and for his persistence in pressing for the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider the bill. 
   By passing this legislation today, the Senate recognizes the contribution of Hmong and Lao immigrants who risked their lives to support U.S. interests in Southeast Asia. The Senate not only recognizes the valor of Hmong and Lao veterans, but also helps them achieve their goal of citizenship. 
   Mr. President, Wisconsin is home to the third largest Hmong community in the United States. We are proud of the Hmong veterans and their families who sacrificed so much for U.S. national security during the Vietnam War and have done so much to enrich Wisconsin and the United States. I have had the opportunity to meet many Lao and Hmong veterans and their families as I travel throughout Wisconsin. I am struck by the profound importance they place on becoming citizens of the United States. The most important thing to many of these individuals is to become legal citizens of the country they risked their lives to help and that they now call home. This bill is the least we can do to help repay the huge debt we owe these brave individuals 
   This legislation is truly long overdue. The Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army should not have had to suffer for so long in obscurity after the end of the Vietnam War. It should not have taken so long for the United States to finally dedicate a monument in Arlington National Cemetery to the Hmong and Lao veterans of the U.S. Secret Army, when it did so in May 1997.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor this morning to talk about the bankruptcy bill. We need to talk about this bill because what is now going on is that those who desperately want to pass the bill are acting in secret to try to avoid the public scrutiny that might lead to some changes in the bill that will benefit average people. 
   The latest rumor is that the bankruptcy bill's sponsors want to combine it with the ``e-signature'' bill and a bill that has never even been considered on the Senate floor--the bill to increase the number of H-1b visas--and bring it to us as a package. Supposedly this will make it more appealing to some people who oppose one or another of those bills. But I think combining major pieces of legislation in a package like this just makes things worse. We are talking here about doing an end run around the legislative process simply to get things done for a narrow set of special interests. I think that's a disgrace and I hope my colleagues will resist it. 
   This is a bill that gets worse the more you look at it. I am disturbed by reports that the final bill will look more like the House-passed bill than the bill that passed the Senate. But it does not surprise me that this is happening, since a bill that is worked out behind closed doors is much more likely to favor powerful financial interests. A public process generally serves the public interest. So no one should be shocked that the private process that the bill's proponents have been following is going to yield a bill that leaves the public behind. 
   I commend to all my colleagues a major investigative story in the May 15th issue of Time Magazine by reporters Donald Bartlett and James Steele. Bartlett and Steele have done a masterful job in explaining how bankruptcy reform legislation ended up being a wish list for the credit card industry. Even more important, they show us the kinds of people who will be hurt by this bill--honest debtors who are down on their luck, forced into bankruptcy by the loss of a job or divorce or catastrophic medical bills. The bill is particularly detrimental to the interests of 
   women. They constitute the largest segment of bankruptcy filers in 1999. These are the people that this bill turns its back on, at the same time that it gives the credit card industry virtually everything that it asked for. 
   Now I don't deny that there is need for some reform in our nation's bankruptcy laws. But what happened with this bill is that when monied interests were given an inch to correct some abuses they took a mile. One area that I devoted a lot of time to on the Senate floor was the treatment of tenants under this bill. The landlord-tenant provision of this bill is typical of the sledgehammer approach that the bill takes to alleged abuses by people declaring bankruptcy. 
   It started with stories of people repeatedly filing for bankruptcy in order to avoid paying rent. But to address that situation a provision was inserted in the bill that completely eliminates the protection of the automatic stay for tenants in bankruptcy. And when I suggested in an amendment that tenants who had never before filed for bankruptcy and were willing to pay their rent during the bankruptcy proceedings should be protected from being thrown out on the street, the proponents of this bill said no. The National Association of Realtors and other groups representing landlords adamantly opposed any weakening of the extreme provision in the bill. And they got their way. 
   That is the kind of excess that you get in legislation when one side is dumping money into the process and the other side is not or cannot. Common Cause just put out a stunning report recently on the amount of money that the credit industry has contributed to members of Congress and the political parties in recent years. $7.5 million in 1999 alone, and $23.4 million  in just the last three years. One company that has been particularly generous is MBNA Corporation, one of the largest issuers of credit cards in the country. In 1998, MBNA gave a $200,000 soft money contribution to the Republican Senatorial Committee on the very day that the House passed the conference report and sent it to the Senate. 
   This year, MBNA gave its first large soft money contribution ever to the Democratic party--it gave $150,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee on December 22, 1999, right in the middle of Senate floor consideration of the bill. 
   So it is no mystery to me why this bill is so anti-consumer, and I don't think it's a mystery to the public either. The bill contains precious little to address abuses by creditors in debt collection and reaffirmation practices, and it contains very weak credit card disclosure provisions. The credit card industry has ridden the rise in personal bankruptcies to get the changes in the law that it wants, but has resisted efforts to inform consumers of the risks of overuse of credit cards. Better disclosure might reduce the number of bankruptcy filings in this country, but the credit industry has successfully prevented the Congress from requiring such disclosure. 
   There is still time to step back from the brink. Nonpartisan experts have many recommendations to reform the bankruptcy laws in a balanced and fair way to get at the abuses, without causing undeserved misery to thousands of powerless and defenseless Americans. Let's listen to them rather than the credit card issuers who are lining our campaign treasuries. 
   I again thank the Senators from Massachusetts, Minnesota and Iowa and my other colleagues who are here this morning to call attention to this crucial issue, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from Iowa for his courtesy in giving me this time to speak in opposition. 
   Mr. President, I rise to take another opportunity to express my disappointment with the conference report on the African Growth and Opportunity Act. I have outlined my concerns about this bill time and again. I have explained how little opportunity it really offers to the countries of Africa. I have expressed my fears about transshipment. I have noted the bill's failure to address the environmental issues that are inextricably linked with trade and investment. And, most importantly, I have pointed out the rather obvious fact that unless we get serious about reducing Africa's debt burden and fighting the region's devastating HIV/AIDS crisis, any effort to stimulate trade and investment is simply an act of political theater. 
   By refusing to address the core obstacles prohibiting so much of that vast continent from achieving its potential as a region of prosperity and a valued trading partner, this Senate is once again ignoring the tough issues in favor of the ultimately futile quick fix. We are capable of better, and the people of Africa are certainly deserving of more. 
   I felt this way before learning the outcome of the conference--I felt this way last year, when I joined Congressman JESSE JACKSON, Jr., to introduce alternative legislation to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. But my disappointment was deepened, and my sense of outrage was provoked, and my resolve to fight for something better was strengthened when the outcome of the conference became apparent. 
   The fate of the Feinstein-Feingold amendment--a provision that was accepted into the manager's package when this bill was debated on the floor last fall but was stripped by the leadership in the final days of the conference--is appalling. Our modest amendment would have prevented the U.S. Government from pressuring African countries that use internationally legal means to make HIV/AIDS medications more accessible to their citizens. I stood on this floor yesterday and cited statistic after shocking statistic, trying to communicate the urgency of the situation and the scale of the crisis. The falling life expectancies, the overcrowded morgues, the millions of orphans, the declines in GDP--I have tried to convey the extent of the disease's reach. In light of these facts, passing legislation that prevents our Government from stopping legal efforts to bring help and hope to the millions affected by the epidemic seemed like the least that this body could do. And yet we could not even accomplish that modest step. We could not even agree to do no harm. 
   And I want to remind my colleagues that this issue will not go away. Even those least inclined to give this issue the attention it deserves will not be able to ignore 5,500 deaths per day, and the social, economic, and political ramifications of those deaths. This issue will not go away as long as the HIV/AIDS crisis continues on its terrible course; this issue will not go away as long as the American public asks tough questions about why this Congress refuses to pass even modest measures like the Feinstein-Feingold amendment; and this issue will not go away as long as I am in this Senate. 
   Most Members didn't have to face up, publicly, to the pressure of the pharmaceutical industry and the far reaching implications of their choice to support or not support the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. But eventually we will all have to face the music, we will have to answer to our constituents and to our consciences. 
   The commitment of the major pharmaceutical companies to differential pricing is perhaps promising, but it raises as many questions as it answers. There is differential pricing today between the United States and Canada.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Iowa. 
   There is differential pricing today between Canada and the United States when it comes to pharmaceuticals, and that is a bad deal. Differential pricing does not necessarily mean the affordable pricing of drugs. 
   But I appreciate the courtesy in being able to speak on this matter because I believe so strongly that the voices in opposition to this bill need to be heard. We did not do the job we needed to do to create a real Africa trade bill. I regret that and will vote in opposition to cloture. I ask my colleagues to vote against cloture. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   We just completed our work on the African Growth and Opportunity Act. I had the opportunity on a number of occasions during the debate to express my concerns about the bill and, in particular, the way in which it did not address one of the greatest crises in Africa--the HIV/AIDS problem. But I have asked for this opportunity to speak about another enormous problem in Africa that I think needs to be closely associated with the debate we just had and our thinking with regard to Africa; that is, the problems with armed conflicts in Africa. 
   Anyone who has been reading the newspapers or watching television in the last few days--whatever the medium--could not help but have a natural reaction to the news from Africa that would suggest an impression of chaos, and even feelings of hopelessness. I am sure this is especially true in the last few days when it comes to the events that are transpiring in Sierra Leone with some United Nations troops being killed, others apparently captured, some missing, protesters being killed, and the absurdity of the United Nations troops protecting Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, the group that has been responsible for some of the most heinous crimes against people we have seen in many years--a group that has been responsible for repeated acts of murder, maiming, and rape. People see this on the television, read about it in the newspaper, and they wonder if there is anything that can be done to help make things different in Africa. 
   Then they read about Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and they have this sense, understandably, that is a place of endless conflict. They read about Ethiopia and the starvation and famine in a border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea that seems to be, at least to many of us, unnecessary and terribly harmful to the people of both countries. They turn on the television, and they see Zimbabwe and what must appear to be a form of chaos with people occupying the land of other people and farmers and farm workers being murdered in a place that a lot of people thought was a success and that now begins to look awfully tense, violent, and undemocratic. 
   Add to that what we have been talking about in the last few days with this enormous AIDS crisis. Then, if you  mention the AIDS crisis to somebody from Africa, they say: By the way, do you know there is a terrible new strain of malaria that has become extremely problematic and dangerous for people in many parts of Africa? So it is easy for anyone to react with resignation. 
   I think this is a compassionate country. I think our elected representatives wish to help. When all of this is viewed, I fear that people believe it is hopeless. I think that is understandable. But it is too easy to give up or to use well-worn phrases to dismiss the situation in the African countries as hopeless. 
   We hear that a lot of records are thrown away. We hear people say, for example, that is just ``tribalism'' and that is what happens when these tribes strike out at one another. 
   Another word used is, well, it is just ``barbarism.'' That is what goes on in Africa, people seem to say, and there is nothing you can do about it. 
   Others point out quite clearly that there are problems with corruption in many of these countries. One very thoughtful Senator actually said to me the other day as we talked about what might be done to try to resolve the problem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Well, I am afraid we are just going to throw away money to make ourselves feel better. 
   That is what some people fear we do when we try to solve or help solve the problem in Africa. 
   I don't think anyone can entirely dismiss any of this. As one who has on occasion shared at least the emotional reaction to these phrases and terms, I am afraid these terms and attitudes reflect a generalization about all of Africa, about the entire continent, that does not hold true. 
   In fact, they are generalizations that even with regard to some of the specific examples do not have a connection to reality. I think these generalizations sometimes suggest, and these phrases sometimes suggest, an unwillingness to explore and understand the differences that actually exist as between these African countries and situations, and in fact the differences between easy assumptions and the facts on the ground in any one of these individual places. 
   I understand how easy it is for someone to slip into a feeling of hopelessness about Africa. I fight it myself in my own experience. Having been in Africa in December for 2 weeks and having traveled to 10 different countries, I have had some moments such as this. Since I have been there, in the countries I actually had a chance to visit, the situation certainly has not vastly improved, as in the Congo--although I will be talking about that shortly. 
   In Rwanda, there has been some political instability, a change of power in the Presidency, and other disturbing events. Namibia, just below Angola, has been drawn, to a greater extent than they had been in the past, into the Angolan conflict that has been going on for about 25 years. This has been only since last December, with refugees crossing border lines in significant numbers. In Angola itself, this brutal civil war continues. You may have seen tragedy in some of these other countries on the television. One of the most horrifying things you could ever see is the incredible tragedy of war and the refugee children in Angola. 
   Then, of course, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe certainly seemed tense in December. I was concerned. President Mugabe seemed quite tense to me at the time, but I had no idea there would be this collapse of a commitment to democracy on the part of the President of Zimbabwe, and all the violence and fear that has resulted. 
   Add to that places I did not go this time. There was a coup d'etat in Cote d'Ivoire. Some say it was for the better in the long run, but a coup d'etat it was. And we have also seen the terrifying and tragic consequences of flooding in Mozambique. 
   Even in Nigeria, which I would cite as a place where we have some greater hope than we used to have, even there where a fledgling democracy is trying to take root, there are repeated examples of religious and geographically based violence that make it difficult to believe the future is going to automatically be a bright one. 
   So I feel all these concerns about these problems, having just been there and traveled to some of these countries. Oddly enough, though, I believe we have to struggle to simultaneously do two things. First, we have to see each of these situations as different instead of just generalizing. Second, at the same time, we have to see the interrelationships between the different situations in Africa and the different countries in Africa. Because if we do not see how these situations relate to each other, we will not be able to help to make stability and peace possible, and we will not be able to help with fighting disease and establishing democracy and fighting corruption. 
   I do not pretend to come close to understanding all of these interrelationships, but I am trying to assist our own analysis of what American foreign policy toward African nations should be. 
   Let me suggest, at the risk of oversimplification, a few distinctions between three different important situations in Africa that we have been reading about right now: Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zimbabwe. They are very different. First, Sierra Leone is obviously a very small country compared to the others, apparently about twice the size of the State of Maryland. The situation in Sierra Leone is certainly more confined than the situation in the Congo, but it does involve other elements. A lot of the refugees from Sierra Leone have gone to Cote d'Ivoire, which has led to some destabilization there. 
   The leader of Liberia, Charles Taylor, has been heavily 
   involved in backing Mr. Sankoh in Sierra Leone, and has caused problems backing the RUF organization that committed so many of these crimes. Unlike so many other African countries, Sierra Leone recently, in the last few years, had their first real democratic election. The President was thrown out in a coup, then the ECOMOG, the Nigerian-led force, came in and put him back in power. But the country descended into this, one of the most brutal civil wars we have witnessed in many years. So the Sierra Leone situation is a very tenuous governmental situation. There is no long, continuous period of rule, either democratic or otherwise, by one particular power or entity or person. 
   Contrast that with the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Congo is, obviously, a huge country. To give you an idea of the size, it is basically the size of all of the United States, from the Mississippi River all the way over including the entire east coast. It is that big in area. But it has not suffered so much from instability, except for in the last few years, as from a brutal rule of Mr. Mobutu who, for maybe 35 years, was the autocratic ruler of what was then called Zaire and who, in fact, some regarded as one of the greatest thieves of all time, in terms of all the resources and riches he spirited out of his nation of Zaire which is now called Congo. 
   Finally, Mr. Mobutu had to flee and a group of powers from around Africa, some of whom are fighting each other now, together helped establish President Laurent Kabila in power a few years ago. 
   So it is a terribly difficult situation, but it is not the same as Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone is a frightening situation. There are great crimes being committed. But what is happening in the Congo quite a few people have referred to as a world war, or Africa's first world war. It is that significant and that problematic. 
   In fact, many people do not realize it but there are so many countries that now have their troops fighting in Congo that it really does look like a world war. There are alliances. For example, one side of combatants that are supposedly allies--although they have been fighting amongst themselves some--are Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi. They are backing the rebels trying to fight the Kabila government. On the other side, you find groups from Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe trying to support and keep in power Mr. Kabila. 
   In addition to that, we fear there are economic incentives for some of these countries to want to stay in Congo. It is a country rich with incredible resources, including diamonds. Some suggest some of these countries may not want to leave the conflict because of the economic opportunities that exist. So, I would have to say Congo is already like the ultimate Rubik's Cube in foreign policy; it is so complicated and difficult, in terms of understanding what is going on and what could be done. 
   It is like a world war. 
   Now, contrast that with the third example, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is in a  very different position. Zimbabwe actually had what, fortunately, became about 20 years ago, majority rule. Although I obviously believe that the previous Rhodesian Government was a terrible government, some of the institutions from that era have continued into the current era and suggest at least a significant commitment in the past to reasonable governance and the rule of law. 
   Unfortunately, that promise and that hope that Mr. Mugabe originally brought have fallen apart. Many people think what is happening in Zimbabwe is a race war; that is not the case. It is not a war of black against white. Some think it is about land reform. Although certainly there should be some land reform, that is not what is happening in what used to be a country that some thought was moving in the right direction. 
   What is happening in this country--that basically was on a better path than Congo, and certainly a better path than Sierra Leone--is President Mugabe is not moving his country forward in a democratic way, in the way that the great Nelson Mandela did. Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest persons of the 20th century, after all those years of imprisonment, became the President of South Africa. What did he do after his first term was up? He believed it was important that democracy work, and he stepped aside and let someone else be elected President. This is just the opposite of what Mr. Mugabe is doing in Zimbabwe, which is threatening to destroy, in my view, a country that has great promise. 
   I am trying to illustrate how different these situations are. Why do I do this? We must consider our responses to each of these crises individually, as well as in the context of Africa as a whole. When we look at each one, as well as any other situation in Africa, I can understand the hesitation on the part of the American people and our elected Representatives. Hesitation is not only understandable, but it makes some sense. 
   I understand the need to be hesitant. Hesitation should not be born of oversimplification or incorrect generalization. I know why we are hesitant to get involved in too many places. I have personally said many times we are overcommitted around the world. We have over 250,000 American troops stationed abroad in this post-cold-war era. We have gotten ourselves in situations in Bosnia and Kosovo and in East Timor and even in Colombia, potentially, that some people would regard as open-ended. I am more optimistic about the East Timor situation. However, I am fearful that in Bosnia and Kosovo we got into a situation very heavily. It is open ended. We may find it difficult to extricate ourselves. That is a reason for hesitation. 
   There are reasons for being hesitant specifically with regard to the record of the efforts made in Africa in the past. Certainly, the failure of the U.N. mission in Congo in the early 1960s is an example often cited as an attempt that failed that makes people hesitant. Without any doubt, the miserable failure of our Somalia mission in northeast Africa in 1993 and 1994 is another example of where the American people would have some reason to pause before wanting to get involved in helping to resolve some of the conflicts in Africa. 
   I think this hesitation begs the question with regard to Africa. I think the question is, Why do we act decisively in other parts of the world, and seem to be disproportionately hesitant to act when it comes to problems in Africa? There are a lot of reasons that might be given for treating Africa differently. Let me suggest I don't think these reasons hold up. I want to mention a few of the reasons that have been given or might be given. 
   First, our not acting in Africa cannot be because of a lack of tragedy, brutality, and even genocide in Africa. Despite the cries of ``never again'' that were legitimately raised with respect to 
   Bosnia and Kosovo and even East Timor, how can anyone now use that kind of phrase with regard to what happens in Africa? I don't need to cite chapter and verse from my colleagues, although maybe I should, about the tragedies and brutality and human suffering in Africa as a result of conflict, be it Angola, Burundi, or, of course, Rwanda. 
   I don't think the reason we don't act in Africa is because the African countries should try to help themselves. The fact is, the African countries are doing a pretty good job with very limited resources to try to shoulder their share of the burden. In fact, they compare favorably to our European allies when it comes to stepping up to the plate in their own region. 
   One of my criticisms of the Bosnia and Kosovo situation is I don't think the European allies did as much as they could and asked us to do more than we should in those situations. There are examples, in Africa, of a better record. Nigeria, a country I have often criticized on this floor, under their previous military regime actually has a good record of trying to resolve conflicts in their region. The ECOMOG forces, led by Nigeria, were involved in trying to change the situation for the better in Liberia, and the Nigerians in the past have taken aggressive steps to try to solve the problem in Sierra Leone, and some hope they will be asked to do this again. 
   When I was in Mali in December, one of the poorest countries in the world, they told me how some of their people were part of the ECOMOG force that went into Sierra Leone, and how they lost eight lives in that mission. They are taking the loss of lives of their own citizens in the name of trying to have peace and stability in their region. I am impressed by that. 
   I am impressed by the comments of President Chiluba of Zambia this weekend who, after a couple hundred of his troops were missing in Sierra Leone, said he regretted it. He was concerned for their safety, but peace was worth this kind of effort. 
   For anyone who thinks the African nations and the African Presidents are asking us to do everything, that is not what the record shows. I don't think it can be a fair objection to our acting and a reason for hesitance to say they are asking for American troops to do this. That is not true. I am not hearing demands for American troops. In fact, I talked to ten different African Presidents about the Congo situation in December, and I don't remember any of them asking for American troops to be involved in this situation. In fact, some did specifically seem to indicate they prefer that there not be American troops involved for whatever reason. This is not a question of whether American ground troops will be asked to resolve these situations. 
   I don't think our hesitance can be explained by suggesting that African situations are somehow too complex--though, as I indicated they often are complex--to try and unravel. Some of the situations are horrible but are relatively straightforward, such as Angola. And as I said, although Congo is complex, so, certainly, are the situations in Bosnia with the ethnic divisions and borders that show no particular relationship to the ethnic identity of the people. There are little enclaves throughout the area. We are talking in this Congress about getting more involved in the situation in Colombia with real money and real resources. That is an enormously complex situation which is related to the situation in other Latin American countries. So it can't simply be that these are tough nuts to crack; they are, but they are not the only ones. We have acted in some incredibly difficult and complex situations in parts of the world that are not in Africa. 
   Can it be because somehow Africa doesn't involve our national security? I don't think it can be that these situations are not dangerous, not only for Africa but for us and the rest of the world. The situation in the Congo is often called Africa's first world war, as I have said. That means not just tragedy for Congo and the nations directly adjacent, but it means it has the potential for enormous disruption throughout the entire continent, and I suggest a destabilizing influence throughout the world when it comes to political borders, when it comes to the spread of AIDS, when it comes to millions of children who are orphans, when it comes to child soldiers marauding around the countries, and, yes, national security because this kind of situation, if left unchecked, opens the door to other countries and other entities that are not our friends, trying to exploit the tragedy in Africa, 
   whether it might be attempted by Libya, North Korea, or perhaps China. It cannot be that we hesitate because this continent  is not in our national interest and is not a question of our national security. 
   Finally, perhaps most important, our hesitance cannot be because the United States and the West have no responsibility to act. Consider the colonial legacy. After my trip, I had a chance to read one of the best and most powerful books I have read in a long time called ``King Leopold's Ghost'' by Adam Hochschild. This is basically the story of the brutal exploitation of the Belgian Congo by Belgium's King Leopold and others in the previous century. Colonialism essentially marauded the social structure of a peaceful people. 
   When that period finally came to an end in 1960, I believe, they had a democratic election. I am sure it was not perfect, but a man named Patrice Lumumba, a hero to the Congolese people, was elected President. A few months later, he was brutally murdered, without a doubt at the instruction of our CIA and our country. That is what we did to the people of Congo, and we installed Mr. Mobutu who proceeded to have one of the most brutal rules in history for the next 30 to 35 years. 
   To suggest we do not have a responsibility, that we did not have anything to do with this is just plain wrong. The same thing goes for Angola. This is not about the colonial era only. Angola was used for many years as a playground for the cold war. The Soviet Union and the United States decided to have it out here, and they planted more landmines in the fields, the rich farm fields of Angola, than any other place in the entire world. As a result, there are more amputees in Angola than anywhere else in the world and in any other time in human history. Walk down a street in Angola and look at the number of people who have lost a limb to landmines--not that lives, of course, were not taken. It is appalling. That was our war. I understand the stakes that were involved, but to suggest we do not have a responsibility when we were that involved in the situation and to fail to help the people from Angola to have a decent life is simply wrong. 
   I have just given six reasons that I do not think can really be the reasons for our not acting in some of these situations. I will now suggest three reasons I think might genuinely explain our extreme hesitance and reluctance to help stop these conflicts in Africa, as compared to our willingness to do it in other parts of the world. 
   First, I believe there is a genuine fear that we will get stuck in one of these situations. Some might call it the Vietnam syndrome, and I understand that, having been a young opponent of the Vietnam war myself in my college years. I remember the song entitled ``Knee Deep in the Big Muddy.'' That was a symbol for our generation of how we were stuck in Vietnam. I am sure many people worry about that. 
   I submit we are already stuck in Bosnia and Kosovo, and I believe we became stuck in those places because we went headlong into those conflicts with no good plan about how to finish it or what resources we would commit to it or what steps would allow us to finish the job or decide that we cannot finish the job. I do think that our hesitance is part of our very recent memory of the enormous tragedy in Africa in Somalia when we lost 18 of our brave soldiers in the helicopter disaster that led to our withdrawal. There is no question in my mind that Americans and American foreign policymakers worry that if we try to help in one of these situations, we will get stuck and cannot get out. When I say ``we,'' I mean the international community, not necessarily just the United States. 
   Second, I think we do not act perhaps when we should because we have a tendency in this country to think in terms of having to do all or nothing in one of these situations; that we have to do the whole thing, and if we do not do the whole thing, somehow we 
   have not lived up to an American obligation to do absolutely everything to solve the problem. 
   Some say do not do it at all unless you are going to go in and get the job done. I have heard that many times with regard to military intervention; why don't we just go in there and finish the job? It is an attitude which, on occasion, is appropriate but I think sometimes leads to mistakes. 
   When it comes to the African situation, this notion that we should do everything or nothing leads to real problems. In Somalia, we tried to do too much when we did not know what we were doing, and then we did nothing when it came to Rwanda. It does not have to be everything or nothing. In fact, there is a recent example I am relatively pleased about, and that is what we are doing in East Timor. We are not leading the charge there. Australia is leading the charge and Asian countries are leading the charge. We are helping in a measured, reasonable way because the countries in that region, as I suggest some of the countries in Africa, are trying to do the same thing. 
   I believe that is a reason people are afraid of doing some things because they want to do everything or nothing. 
   A third reason we do not act, and a genuine reason--and I fear it is the most important reason and I wish I did not have to come to this conclusion--but I do think there is somehow, unbelievably, a double standard when it comes to Africa. This is very bad for Africa, and I submit it is just as bad for the United States. 
   When I see President Mbeki of South Africa and the President of the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin, get together at a news conference and comment about how they are tired of having one country calling all the shots in the world, I see fertile ground for resentment against the United States that can hurt us today and can especially hurt America and our children and grandchildren in the future. 
   This is a sad thing to let happen because we do not have a lot of the colonial baggage and some of the resentment that Africans feel toward countries such as Belgium because we were not deeply involved in many of those situations. We have a positive opportunity, when it comes to much of Africa, to get it right. 
   It is this idea of getting it right that brings me to the specific purpose of these comments, and that is that we should not summarily retreat from the pursuit of peace and self-determination in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I fear there will be some kind of a knee-jerk reaction because of the very disturbing news and film coming from Sierra Leone. The United Nations there obviously has not yet got it right. I may well be interested in seeing and helping that United Nations effort become stronger and tougher to deal with the brutality that is going on, and we cannot abandon that situation, but I believe there is a way to get it right in Congo. One of the main reasons is the leadership of a man from whom I stole the phrase ``Get It Right,'' and that is our Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, whom I had the chance to accompany on a trip to Africa in December. It was an honor to be on that trip, and we had a chance together to meet with virtually every one of the African Presidents who are directly interested in this conflict. 
   I want my colleagues to know that, although we were extremely moved and troubled by the AIDS crisis in Africa, and that overtook us emotionally on the trip, the core reason for the trip was to see if the Ambassador and I and others could get an understanding of the complexity of what is going on in the Congo and what we could do about it. 
   I want my colleagues to know--and I heard him do it--that at each stop, Ambassador Holbrooke said: We want to help, but there are no blank checks and we must get it right or we cannot help. 
   He was very measured and showed due caution. Of course, the situation in the Congo is incredibly difficult, but I see some reason to see it as progressing in the right direction, slowly but surely. I understand that our support may not necessarily work, that there could be a failure, but I think that serious logical steps can be taken. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to, just very briefly, indicate some of the steps that have been taken in the Congo pursuant to what is called the Lusaka agreement that suggests to me this is a situation worth supporting if at all possible. 
   The countries involved, including the Congo itself, and some of the rebel groups, have signed this Lusaka agreement that set up something called a  joint military commission. This joint military commission is committed to doing the job of actually enforcing the peace and making sure the parties withdraw from the other countries. 
   In order to get to phase 2 of this operation that is now contemplated, a number of things had to happen. The joint military commission had to be created, and an initial 90 observers from the U.N. had to be deployed. That was done. But before the next phase goes forward--the one that involves some 5,500 U.N. troops and personnel--a number of other things had to happen as well. 
   There had to be a functioning cease-fire. Although it has not worked at all times--and at the moment is in a little bit of trouble because of the conflict between Uganda and Rwanda--on the whole, it has succeeded in the last month. Second, it was essential that all these parties come together and pick one person as a facilitator of the process of national dialogue. After a number of efforts, they did so, by appointing President Masire, the former President of Botswana. 
   They had to create an operational arrangement of the U.N. MONUC group and the JMC to coordinate, and they did it. They had to have a signed commitment by the parties of the conflict guaranteeing security and freedom of movement and access for the U.N. team. And they did it. 
   So now we come to the point of where additional steps, hopefully, can be taken. We are now looking at getting into the second phase of this peace operation, including developing plans to disengage and withdraw the troops from the various countries and parties that have signed this agreement, and the conducting of an inter-Congolese dialog that could lead to a genuine democratic country, and to develop these plans with the JMC. 
   If that is accomplished, and only if these steps are accomplished, would we go forward to the final steps, phase 3, which involves verifying the withdrawal of foreign forces, normalizing border security, and, yes, finally, again, after all these years, the conducting of a democratic election. 
   So what I am seeing here, although it is certainly not perfect, is a measured step-by-step approach--not an all-or-nothing approach--but a step-by-step approach, led by the African countries. That is something I think we should encourage and even admire because it is so very difficult to do in this situation. 
   For me, there is a sufficient record to say, we must try to do something--not send U.S. troops, not send a huge United Nations force of 30,000 or 40,000 people, as some have wondered about. 
   It may not work, and we may ultimately have to say no to doing more, as tragic as failure would be--but based on the facts that I have witnessed and learned about, I think we must try. 
   We must not wash our hands of this or just say that it would be an example of throwing money in the Congo to make ourselves feel better. I believe we should support financially--and in other ways--the efforts for peace in the Congo. We must try. 
   Again, why must we try? I think because this is a test--it is a very tough test--but it is a test of whether the United States really does have a double standard vis-a-vis Africa. To abandon the Congo without an effort would be a strong signal that we intend to abandon all of Africa. 
   We must try, even though we have tried in other situations with great difficulty--such as Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti. Let 
   me again suggest I think we went too headlong into those situations. I do not think we were careful to take the measured steps that are being done in this case. And that led to our complete, abject failure to act with regard to Rwanda. As I have said, even with regard to Somalia, mistakes were made. But I think that is because it was, again, an example of an all-or-nothing approach, with no clear mission, and no exit strategy. 
   I think this is different. I think this has the potential to work, although it is difficult, because it is measured and it is an African-dominated approach. 
   I think we have to try because at this time in human history the crimes against Africa have to be halted. I do not have time to talk about the slave trade, the gap between the rich and the poor, the use of these countries as a playing field for colonial powers during the cold war. But we cannot extol this new global economy and trade around the world and have these African nations treated forever as hopeless and fundamentally different. 
   We must try, in fact, because the lofty rhetoric of U.S.-Africa trade becomes something of a cruel hoax on the people of Africa if we are not going to confront the brutality, the chaos, and even the genocide in the very nations with whom we claim we want to have improved trade. 
   We must try because I think it truly hurts America in the world's eyes, at a critical time in our role as a world leader, if we are perceived as being unwilling to help African nations when they desperately need that help. 
   Finally, to return to my initial theme--because each situation in Africa is different, and yet interrelated--if we help move this process forward, this Lusaka agreement, involving cooperation between the U.N. and the joint military commission, it cannot only give Congo what it has always deserved and never had--real peace, self-determination and hope--but it can help its neighbors. 
   Rwanda is greatly destabilized and threatened because of this conflict in the Congo. Uganda has a very problematic border with the Congo, and other countries, and is now in conflict with Rwanda because they are in the Congo together. That would help alleviate that situation. Burundi has enormous problems of its own, which President Mandela is trying to help with. None of these countries should be involved in the Congo conflict. They have problems of their own. 
   Angola, which I have described as one of the most horrifying situations in Africa, should not be having troops up in this area for whatever reason, perhaps because of their conflict within their own country. We can cause this to be a more localized problem that perhaps we could deal with. 
   Namibia certainly should not have troops up in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, nor should the other countries, when all it does is drain their resources and causes problems over their borders. 
   And, of course, Zimbabwe. Talk about any country in the world that should not be using its resources right now to fight a war in the Congo, when it has such desperate economic and political problems at this time. Even South Africa suffers in its tremendous struggle to become one of the great nations of the world as long as this Congo conflict continues. 
   Let us be realistic, but let us also be open to the possibility of trying in the Congo. Let us not have a double standard where we act with great rhetoric and words of ``never again'' in so many places in the world, but when it comes to Africa, we seem to be unable to act. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this month I join Americans throughout Wisconsin and across the nation in celebrating Taiwanese American Heritage Week, honoring the many important contributions to American society of the more than half a million Taiwanese Americans in the United States. Without the contributions of Taiwanese Americans, we would lack the important AIDS research of Dr. David Ho. We would be denied the work of Nobel Laureate chemist Dr. Lee Yuan-Tse and that of the many American scientists he inspired. We would not be able to search for information on the internet by using Yahoo, co-founded by Jerry Yang. Thousands of Taiwanese Americans throughout the country have made important achievements in a wide range of sectors, including doctors, teachers, lawyers, and computer technology experts. They have improved the lives of their fellow American citizens, and they will play an integral role in our future. 
   Besides their many contributions here at home, Taiwanese Americans have also played a vital role in the political transformation of Taiwan. For many years, they organized letter-writing campaigns, planned marches and demonstrations, and talked to any U.S. policy-maker who would listen about their dreams for Taiwan's future as free and democratic. Many risked arrest in--or exile from--their homeland as a result of their activities. The tireless work of Taiwanese Americans helped ensure the success of Taiwan's democratic evolution, beginning with the lifting of martial law in 1987 and culminating with the first fully democratic presidential election in 1996. These are achievements that all Americans can celebrate. I join Taiwanese Americans in congratulating the winners of the March presidential elections in Taiwan. 
   Mr. President, Taiwanese American Heritage Week recognizes the long-standing friendship between the people of the United States and Taiwan, and celebrates our shared values. I commend the great accomplishments and contributions of the Taiwanese American community.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first say the senior Senator from California certainly should not apologize for her emotion. If there ever was an issue that deserves such a powerful display of passion and emotion, it is this issue of the AIDS crisis in Africa and the outrageous nerve of these pharmaceutical companies of removing this modest provision that the Senate unanimously placed in the bill in the conference report. It is an abysmal moment. 
   I thank the Senator for her leadership, her passion, and for her willingness to continue this fight that we all will continue as long as it takes. 
   Before we go any further with this conference report, I come to the floor to follow on the comments of the Senator from California to make something clear to my colleagues. I think we can do better than this. We have lost our way with this new Africa policy. We have to chart a new course if we are to seek a better world for Africa and for America. 
   I say this as a Senator, an American, and as a human being who has been to Africa, seen its promise, and been appalled by its suffering. I come here to express my disappointment about the African Growth and Opportunity Act and my deep dismay about how and why the Feinstein-Feingold amendment on the HIV/AIDS crisis was kept out of the conference report. 
   Very simply, I am talking today about the future of U.S.-Africa policy. We have a role to play in Africa's future and we have to decide what that role is going to be. Some in this body think AGOA is the right example of what our role in Africa's future should be. The African Growth and Opportunities Act supporters believe this legislation is somehow a landmark, that it represents a real opportunity for growth on the continent, a new way of thinking about Africa. They want us to believe, as they believe, that to reject it would be to reject all engagement with the continent and, indeed, to reject all of the enterprise and energy of the people of Africa. 
   But they are wrong. This bill is deeply flawed. For 7 years I have served on the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa and I have committed myself to supporting democratization, peace, and development in the many countries of that continent. I support engagement with Africa as strongly as any Member of this body. I am deeply concerned about the dearth of economic ties between the people of the United States and those of the African Continent. The current level of trade between us is depressingly small. Africa represents only 1 percent of our imports, 1 percent of our exports, and only 1 percent of our foreign direct investment. 
   So if the question is, Should something be done to stimulate our trade with Africa, the answer is ``absolutely.'' But I urge this body, let's not pretend we are now somehow debating a comprehensive trade package for Africa, for this bill is not in any sense comprehensive. Let's not fail to address the need to build an environment, an actual environment that will foster and sustain mutually beneficial economic relationships. If we fail to assemble the components of that environment in this trade package, it cannot be called comprehensive, and I would certainly say it should not even be passed. 
   There really are only two defensible views of this bill. It either does virtually nothing at all, or it does actual harm. This legislation does very little for Africa. The trade benefits we are talking about are not terribly significant, primarily making African states eligible for temporary preferential access to the U.S. markets for textiles and apparel. Many of Africa's primary exports are not addressed at all by this legislation. This legislation does little to address the African context for economic growth and that context is a challenging one. It is a context of boundless potential amid a web of obstacles. 
   Economic growth in sub-Sarahan Africa faces the obstacle of a staggering $230 billion in bilateral and multilateral debt. Africa's debt service requirements now take over 20 percent of the region's export earnings. How can Africa, to which the Presiding Officer has certainly devoted a lot of his attention, become a strong economic partner when its states must divert funds away from schools, away from health care, and away from infrastructure in order to service this crushing debt burden? How can we talk about economic engagement and simply pay lip service to these painfully obvious realities? 
   I am sorry to say in several ways I think this legislation actually would do harm. By addressing seriously only one industry, the textile industry, it fails to support the kind of diversification that any economy, including African economies, need to regain strength and stability. I fear AGOA also fails 
   to adequately tackle the serious problem of transshipment. 
   Transshiment is a practice whereby, for example, producers in China and other third party countries establish sham production facilities in countries which may export to the United States under more favorable conditions. Then these producers ship goods, made in their factories at home and meant for the U.S. market, to the third country. In this case it would be an African country. They pack it or assemble it in some minor way and send it off to the United States of America with a new label ``Made In Africa,'' thereby enjoying all the trade benefits that label would bring. 
   As I told my colleagues on a number of occasions, and as I think they know, transshipment is really a very serious problem. Approximately $2 billion worth of illegally transshipped textiles  enter the United States every year. The U.S. Customs Service has determined that for every $1 billion of illegally transshipped products that enter the United States, 40,000 jobs in the textile and apparel sector are lost. 
   In this regard, just to give you a sense of the thinking that goes on behind this kind of scam, I would like to share some of the words from the People's Republic of China. This is a quote taken directly from the official web site of the Chinese Ministry of Trade and Economic Cooperation. This is the quote:  
   There are many opportunities for Chinese business people in Africa....... Setting up assembly plants with Chinese equipment, technology and personnel could not only greatly increase sales in African countries, but also circumvent the quotas imposed on commodities of Chinese origin imposed by European and American countries.  
   There it is, right on their web page. It is not hard to see that those who would engage in transshipment are not too worried about the protections we currently have in place to guard against it. This same visa system that has failed us in the past is the basis, again, for the allegedly effective AGOA protections. In fact, the African Growth and Opportunity Act does not require that Africans themselves be employed at firms that are receiving the trade benefits. This is progress? If nothing else, I think it raises a red flag for my colleagues, when they consider the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This should be a crystal clear signal: Nothing in this Act ensures that whatever opportunities this legislation may create--there is no guarantee these will be opportunities for Africans, for citizens of African countries. 
   AGOA does not mention environmental standards at all, but any plan for sustainable economic development must include some notion of environmental protection. I think this is especially true of a continent like Africa where, in some countries, 85 percent of the people live directly off the land. We are all affected when logging and mining deplete African rain forests and increase global warming. 
   We all lose when species unique to Africa are lost to hasty profit-making schemes, hatched without regard to sustainability or long-term environmental effects. Environmental quality also has serious implications for peace and stability in the region. As we have seen in the Niger Delta, environmental degradation can lead to civil unrest. Responsible trade policies must adequately address human rights and environmental issues, not just because it is the right thing to do but because also in the long run it will create a better business climate for Africans and Americans alike. 
   In addition, the African Growth and Opportunity Act fails to address the critical role that development assistance ought to play in promoting African growth and opportunity. That failure has raised an alarm here at home and internationally. The perception is that the United States has deluded itself into believing that a small package of trade benefits, benefits which may not actually benefit Africans themselves, can replace a responsible and well-monitored program of development assistance. I am afraid that this inevitably will cast doubt on the U.S. commitment to development in Africa. 
   I care about each of the objections I just raised to this bill. But let me tell you, just as the senior Senator from California indicated, more than anything else what makes me doubt the U.S. commitment to development in Africa is that this conference report turns a blind eye to the AIDS crisis by excluding the modest Feinstein-Feingold amendment. As the ranking member of the subcommittee on Africa, I have always felt very strongly about the issue of AIDS in Africa. I tried to raise it last year and this year in the context of the Africa trade debate. I raised it on many occasions in meetings with African heads of state. 
   I applaud the U.N. Security Council's decision to address the crisis earlier this year, and I do support the administration's call to increase the resources directed at this AIDS crisis. But what I cannot support, what I cannot applaud, and what I cannot even understand is how this body can pass up an opportunity to take just one small step toward addressing the AIDS crisis in Africa. I am referring to the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. It was very modest. It simply prohibited Federal money from being used to lobby a government to change TRIPS-compliant laws, allowing access to HIV drugs. Our amendment was taken out in the conference committee. So now this bill, which makes a weak attempt to address Africa trade as it is, does nothing--an African Growth and Opportunity Act does nothing to actually address the HIV/AIDS crisis that affects every aspect of the African economy, not to mention every African life. 
   We have before us a conference report which does nothing to fight the AIDS crisis that is ravaging Africa, threatening to destroy its economies and decimate its communities. Why? How can it be that we will debate a bill of this nature and ignore the single most important issue facing sub-Sarahan Africa today? Why is it that one modest provision included by this Senate, the Feinstein-Feingold amendment regarding HIV/AIDS drug in Africa, was removed from this bill? 
   When the Senate was debating that legislation last year, Senator FEINSTEIN and I offered our amendment, which was readily accepted by the bill's managers, Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN, to address a critically important issue--an issue relating to Africa's devastating AIDS crisis; an issue that has cast a dark shadow on United States-African relations in the past. 
   Our amendment was simple. It prohibited the U.S. Government or any agent of the U.S. Government from pressuring African countries to revoke or change laws aimed at increasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question adhere to existing international regulations governing trade. Quite simply, our amendment told the executive branch to stop twisting the arms of African countries that are using legal means to improve access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals for their people. 
   The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, allows for compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency. Approximately 13 million African lives have been lost since the onset of the crisis. According to the Rockefeller Foundation's recent report, ``on statistics alone, young people from the most affected countries in Africa are more likely than not to perish of AIDS.'' Consider that I say to my colleagues: more likely to perish than not. If these do not constitute emergency conditions, then I do not know what does. 
   This was a very modest amendment, but the final version of the amendment discussed by the conferees was even more modest. It was a true compromise. It was not as strong as I would have liked it to be, and I worked hard to keep it strong, but even the compromise pushed our policy closer to the right thing. I again thank the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, the Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, and the Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH, and their staffs for working so hard to keep this amendment in at the conference level. 
   But despite these efforts, despite the concessions that Senator FEINSTEIN and I made, despite the fact that this is the right thing to do, the Feinstein-Feingold amendment was stripped in conference. The opposition to our amendment is baffling. How do the conferees who killed this provision justify pressuring these countries, where in some cases AIDS has reduced life expectancies by more than 15 years, not to use all legal means at their disposal to provide effective medicines for their citizens? Without broader access to these drugs in Africa, more people will suffer, more people will die--that is a simple fact. 
   I cannot imagine that ordinary Americans are urging their representatives to oppose the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. I cannot imagine that anyone would try to prevail upon my colleagues to oppose this measure--except perhaps for pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical industry does not fear losing customers in Africa, because they know that Africans simply cannot afford their prices. But they do fear that taking this modest step in this time of crisis could somehow, in some ill-defined scenario in the future, cut into their most important consideration: their bottom line. 
   That brings me to the calling of the bankroll. 
   From time to time on this floor when we debate the issues, I review some  facts and figures that most of my colleagues are unwilling to discuss. 
   I have dubbed it the ``calling of the bankroll''--a chance for my colleagues and the public to consider not just the issues, but the money that drives the issues in our democracy today. 
   I can tell you, the pharmaceutical industry is certainly no exception when it comes to playing the political money game--in fact, huge donations to the parties are the rule in the pharmaceutical industry. 
   I would like to discuss a few of the companies that fought against the Feinstein-Feingold amendment, not in terms of policy, although I have certainly done that and will continue to, but in terms of political donations. 
   All the figures I am about to cite are for the first 15 months of the current election cycle--all of 1999 
   and the first 3 months of this year. 
   I will start with Pfizer, which is one of several pharmaceutical giants that rank among the top soft money donors in 1999, and with good reason. Pfizer and its executives gave more than $511,000 in soft money during the period, including a $100,000 contribution earlier this year. Pfizer was also a top PAC money donor in its industry during the period, with more than $242,000 to Federal candidates during the period. 
   Then there's Bristol Myers Squibb, another top soft money donor, which, with its executives, gave nearly $529,000 in soft money to the parties, including two $100,000 contributions during the period. Bristol Myers Squibb also gave more than $146,000 in PAC money during the period. 
   Merck and Company gave more than $51,000 in soft money and nearly $168,000 in PAC money during the period. 
   And finally, Glaxo Wellcome and its executives gave more than $272,000 in soft money to the parties and gave more PAC money than any other pharmaceutical company during the period--more than $291,000. 
   Those are the donations of some of the pharmaceutical companies that fought so hard against the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. They are donations that signal influence, power, and political clout--political clout that most Americans could never hope for, and no African living with HIV could ever dream of. In the fight over the Feinstein-Feingold amendment, the pharmaceutical companies clearly got their way, while millions of Africans suffering from HIV and AIDS were left without even one glimmer of hope from this body or this bill. 
   The people of Africa desperately need hope in the midst of the AIDS crisis. I am going to share some numbers, along the lines of other speakers, that put the staggering AIDS crisis in Africa in stark relief. 
   The disease is already the fourth biggest cause of death in the world. In at least five African countries, more than one adult in five has HIV. 
   Economic growth in Africa faces the obstacle of a devastating HIV/AIDS epidemic. In the course of 1998, AIDS was responsible for an estimated 2 million African deaths. That is 5,500 deaths a day. At least 12 million Africans have been killed by AIDS since the onset of the crisis. Africa accounts for over half of the world's cases of HIV. The realities of a continent gripped by this disease are truly horrifying--lines outside cemeteries as families wait to bury the dead, and morgues that operate around the clock, 7 days a week. I am told in Harare, Zimbabwe there are 24-hour morgues. 
   For Africa's children, it may be most horrifying of all. Eighty-seven percent of the world's HIV-positive children live in Africa. According to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, the disease has left 10 million African orphans in its wake. Their lives are that continent's future. Their chronic illness and their deaths each day erode a little more of Africa's promise. It is difficult to see how the United States can enjoy mutually beneficial trade relations with Africa unless we commit ourselves to addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis on a scale beyond anything we have done before. 
   In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe, 25 percent of the people between the ages of 15 and 19 are HIV positive. 
   One report by ING Barings, an investment bank, said that almost 19 percent of all skilled workers in South Africa will have HIV by 2015. To make matters worse, food production in southern Africa has been impacted by the crisis. For example, maize production in Zimbabwe declined 61 percent last year due to illness and death from AIDS. 
   By 2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people than it would have had if there had been no AIDS epidemic. 
   My recent trip to ten African countries only renewed my resolve to address this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. 
   When we were in Namibia, I saw a group of HIV-positive citizens pull up to a meeting in a van with curtained windows, and they hurried to the safety of the meeting room as soon as they arrived. They were fearful. They were afraid that their identity would be revealed, and that the stigma still attached to the disease would cause them to lose their jobs and maybe even to be disowned by their own families. It was shocking--in a country gripped by the epidemic, people are still afraid to acknowledge the crisis. 
   In Zambia I visited an orphanage of sorts, where 500 children, many of them orphaned when AIDS killed their parents, gathered by day. 
   This isn't even an orphanage where you get to stay at night. It is just a place where a bunch of kids who don't have any parents hang out during the day before they go out to the streets at night to sleep. 
   At night, there is only room for 50 of them--the rest must make their own arrangements, and many end up sleeping on the streets, sometimes prostituting themselves--thereby risking exposure to HIV in their own struggle to survive. By the end of this year, an astonishing 10.4 million African children under 15 will have lost their mothers or both parents to AIDS--90 percent of the global total of AIDS orphans. 
   In Zimbabwe, some estimates indicate that life expectancy has precipitously dropped from 65 to 39 years. Let me repeat that: life expectancy in Zimbabwe dropped from 65 to 39. Walking past the Parliament building one day, I asked how old one had to be to become a legislator there in Zimbabwe. What was the answer? The answer was 40. Life expectancy is 39, but you have to be 40 to be elected to the legislature. That exchange helped me to grasp how far-reaching the consequences of this disease really are--no society is structured in a way that prepares it to deal with an unchecked epidemic like AIDS. In southern Africa, life expectancy at birth is dropping at a frightening rate. According to one recent U.N. report, expected life spans in the region will drop from 59 years in the early 1990s to just 45 by the year 2010. 
   In July 1999, the National Institutes of Health released a report on the effectiveness of a drug called nevirapine--NVP--in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Studies indicate that this drug can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission by more than 50 percent. 
   NVP is given just once to the mother during labor and once to the baby within 3 days after birth. It cost $4 per tablet. This relatively simple and inexpensive drug regimen has created an unprecedented opportunity for international cooperation in the fight against the vertical transmission of HIV. 
   And Uganda is making real headway with regard to prevention. There was a time in Uganda when, of the women coming to the reproductive health clinics, 35 to 40 percent of them tested positive for HIV. But since 1992, the Ugandan Government's very frank and high-profile public education efforts have helped to reduce the incidence of HIV infection by more than 15 percent. Uganda has shown that something can be done. Uganda has demonstrated that prevention can work. 
   But despite these positive signs, there are many fronts on which there has been very little progress. Virtually no one has access to drugs to treat the disease. Prevention is unquestionably the most important element of the equation, but treatment cannot be ignored. Poverty should not be a death sentence--not when the infectious disease that is destroying African society can be treated. 
   The AIDS crisis in Africa is exactly what the TRIPS agreement was meant to address. This is a crisis, an emergency on an incomprehensibly vast scale. This is the rare and urgent situation that calls for something beyond a  dogmatic approach to intellectual property rights. 
   If allowing for a TRIPS-compliant response seems expensive, just think how expensive it will be, in the long run, not to do so. Even beyond the human tragedy, there are vast economic costs to this epidemic. AIDS affects the most productive segment of society. It is turning the future leaders of the region into a generation of orphans. 
   It is simply unconscionable for the U.S. Government to fight the legal efforts of African states to save their people from this plague. I cannot imagine why any of my colleagues would support such action. Those dissatisfied with the TRIPS agreement should focus their efforts on changing it--not on twisting the arms of countries in crisis who seek only to protect their people from sickness and death in a manner that complies fully with international law. 
   Again, how could the irresponsible and callous decision to strip the Feinstein-Feingold amendment from the conference have been made? I have some idea, as I said before. Some may have bowed to the pressure of the pharmaceutical industry. And some members just don't get it. 
   But this body has to ``get it.'' We don't have time to posture while HIV infects more than 15,000 young people each day, and the most productive segment of a society is wiped out by disease. We cannot waste precious legislative opportunities as millions of orphans grow up on Africa's streets, without any guidance or education. After witnessing the shocking violence that resulted, in large part, from the masterful manipulation of disenfranchised youth in West Africa over the last decade, I think we all have to take this threat seriously, and acknowledge that the threat is fueled each day by the withering scourge of AIDS 
   that today is galloping through so much of Africa and other parts of the developing world. 
   Mr. President, until recently this Senate has been moving in the right direction on these issues. I have been pleased to work with many of my colleagues in a bipartisan effort--I do want to mention in particular the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Tennessee for his efforts in this regard--we have worked together to raise the profile of the epidemic and to work toward a comprehensive package aimed at addressing this crisis. It disturbs me a great deal to think that Members of this body have somehow failed to hear us, or perhaps refused to listen. 
   As long as we fail to grasp the magnitude of the epidemic and its consequences, AIDS will continue to take its terrible toll on families and communities, on economies, and on stability around the world. And as long as we pass legislation like AGOA, we fail to seriously address virtually every crucial aspect of our trade relationship with sub-Saharan Africa. 
   Everytime we make this kind of weak attempt to improve our trade relationship with Africa, we admit that we are willing to dismiss African countries' problems, and that we are comfortable ignoring the continent's boundless promise. 
   I care deeply about Africa and about U.S. policy towards Africa, and my colleagues know that. But I am here today not just because of my own concerns, but because of others--because I know how deeply they care about Africa, and I have heard them voice their very serious concerns about AGOA. 
   African-American leaders ranging from Cornel West to Randall Robinson have opposed the African Growth and Opportunity Act.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take time to share some excerpts taken from the National Intelligence Estimate 99-17D of January 2000, which frames infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, as a national security threat to the United States. 
   This is, obviously, pursuant to the discussion we have been having most of the day with regard to the inadequacy of the African Growth and Opportunity Act with regard to the provisions concerning HIV/AIDS in Africa and, in particular, the very serious error of the conference committee in eliminating the Feinstein-Feingold amendment concerning HIV/AIDS. 
   This report represents an important initiative on the part of the Intelligence Community to consider the national security dimension of a nontraditional threat. It responds to a growing concern by senior US leaders about the implications--in terms of health, economics, and national security--of the growing global infectious disease threat. The dramatic increase in drug-resistant microbes, combined with the lag in development of new antibiotics, the rise of megacities with severe health care deficiencies, environmental degradation, and the growing ease and frequency of cross-border movements of people and produce have greatly facilitated the spread of infectious diseases. 
   As part of this new US Government effort, the National Intelligence Council produced this national intelligence estimate. It examines the most lethal diseases globally and by region; develops alternative scenarios about their future course; examines national and international capacities to deal with them; and assesses their national global social, economic, political, and security impact. 
   Of the seven biggest killers worldwide, TB, malaria, hepatitis, and, in particular, HIV/AIDS continue to surge, with HIV/AIDS and TB likely to account for the overwhelming majority of deaths from infectious diseases in developing countries by 2020. 
   Sub-Saharan Africa-accounting for nearly half of infectious disease deaths globally--will remain the most vulnerable region. The death rates for many diseases, including HIV/AIDS and malaria, exceed those in all other regions. Sub-Saharan Africa's health care capacity--the poorest in the world--will continue to lag. 
   The most likely scenario, in our view, is one in which the infectious disease threat--particularly from HIV/AIDS--worsens during the first half of our time frame, but decreases fitfully after that, owing to better prevention and control efforts, new drugs and vaccines, and socioeconomics improvements. In the next decade, under this scenario, negative demographic and social conditions in developing countries, such as continued urbanization and poor health care capacity, remain conducive to the spread of infectious diseases; persistent poverty sustains the least developed countries as reservoirs of infection; and microbial resistance continues to increase faster than the pace of new drug and vaccine development. During the subsequent decade, more positive demographic changes such as reduced fertility and aging populations; gradual socioeconomic improvement in most countries; medical advances against childhood and vaccine-preventable killers such as diarrheal diseases, neonatal tetanus, and measles; expanded international surveillance and response systems; and improvements in national health care capacities take hold in all but the least developed countries. 
   Barring the appearance of a deadly and highly infectious new disease, a catastrophic upward lurch by HIV/AIDS, or the release of a highly contagious biological agent capable of rapid and widescale secondary spread, these developments produce at least limited gains against the overall infectious disease threat. However, the remaining group of virulent diseases, led by HIV/AIDS and TB, continue to take a significant toll. The persistent infectious disease burden is likely to aggravate and, in some cases, may even provoke economic decay, social fragmentation, and political destabilization in the hardest hit countries in the developing and former communist worlds. 
   The economic costs of infectious disease--especially HIV/AIDS and malria--are already significant, and their increasingly heavy toll on productivity, profitability, and foreign investment will be reflected in growing GDP losses, as well, that could reduce GDP by as much as 20 percent or more by 2010 in some Sub-Saharan African countries, according to recent studies. 
   Some of the hardest hit countries in Sub-Saharan Africa--and possibly later in South and Southeast Asia--will face a demographic upheaval as HIV/AIDS and associated diseases reduce human life expectancy by as much as 30 years and kill as many as a quarter of their populations over a decade or less, producing a huge orphan cohort. Nearly 42 million children in 27 countries will lose one or both parents to AIDS by 2010; 19 of the hardest hit countries will be in Sub--Sahran Africa. 
   The relationship between disease and political instability is indirect but real. A wide-ranging study on the causes of state instability suggests that infant mortality--a good indicator of the overall quality of life--correlates strongly with political instability, particularly in countries that already have achieved a measure of democracy. The severe social and economic impact of infectious diseases is likely to intensify the struggle for political power to control scarce state resources.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Let me first thank the managers for allowing us the opportunity to introduce our bill at this time. I especially thank my friend, the Senator from Maine, for taking the lead on this issue with me. She is a very effective Senator on many issues, and is specially effective, I think, when it comes to the concerns of rural people in Maine and throughout the country about an issue which is incredibly important--first aid. 
   I also thank the Presiding Officer, the junior Senator from Rhode Island, for joining us and cosponsoring the bill. 
   I rise today with Senator COLLINS to introduce the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act. This legislation provides a first step to helping save the lives of the more than 250,000 people who die each year from sudden cardiac arrest. 
   Every two minutes, someone in America falls into sudden cardiac arrest--a medical emergency in which the heart's rhythm becomes so erratic it can not pump blood to the brain and other vital organs. 
   According to the American Heart Association, over 250,000 Americans die each year from sudden cardiac arrest. That is 700 deaths each day--a startlingly large number. Overall heart disease kills more Americans than AIDS, cancer, and diabetes combined. 
   In my home state of Wisconsin, as in many other states, heart disease is the number one killer. Ninety-five sudden deaths from cardiac arrest occur each day in Wisconsin. 
   These numbers are disturbing by any measure, but they are especially troubling because they don't need to be this high. By taking some relatively simple steps, we can give victims of cardiac arrest a better chance of survival, particularly in rural areas. Cardiac arrest victims are in a race against time, and today I'm introducing a bill to increase access to defibrillators, that are essential to reviving cardiac arrest victims. 
   Cardiac arrest strikes its unwilling victims with no warnings or indications. In most cases it's all but impossible to predict who will have a sudden cardiac arrest, or where and when it will happen. 
   Cardiac arrest can strike anyone. When cardiac arrest occurs, the victim loses consciousness, has no pulse and stops breathing normally. Death often occurs within minutes. 
   Cardiac arrest does not discriminate against age, gender, or race. A recent issue of Women's Day magazine detailed a number of cases in which a variety of people suffered from cardiac arrest. 
   The article tells about a 24-year-old woman, a writer for a Seattle comedy show, who suffered 
   from cardiac arrest after watching her favorite television show. Another victim was a 48-year-old women who was out for a birthday dinner with her husband and friend. Yet another individual, only 31 years of age, suffered cardiac arrest at his computer programing job in Minnesota. 
   What these victims have in common is that all three survived. Each was saved because a properly trained person was there with an automated external defibrillator (AED). These life saving machines are compact, portable, battery-operated versions of the machines that were traditionally only in the hands of emergency medical personnel. 
   Wisconsin's Emergency Medical Services are some of the finest in the country. They are effectively trained to identify victims and determine when a shock is needed. There are countless stories of quick EMS responses that have saved so many lives. 
   Unfortunately, for those in many rural areas, Emergency Medical Services have simply too far to go to reach people in need and time runs out for victims of cardiac arrest. It's simply not possible to have EMS units next to every farm and small town across the nation. 
   Fortunately, recent technological advances have made the newest generation of AEDs inexpensive--approximately $3,000--and simple to operate. Because of these advancements in AED technology, it is now practical to train and equip fire department personnel, police officers, and other community organizations--and that's exactly what this legislation would do. 
   But let me be clear, I think they are only one part of the so-called chain of survival. 
   This chart indicates the four crucial aspects of the chain of survival, which is a proven method to save lives. 
   The first link in the chain is simple: it is vitally important that cardiac arrest victims have early access to care. When someone suffers from cardiac arrest, it's crucial that bystanders dial 911 to dispatch the appropriate emergency personnel to the scene. 
   The next link is early CPR--if performed properly, it will at least buy a few minutes to perform defibrillation. Let me be clear though, effective CPR does not replace defibrillation in saving lives. 
   The critical link in the chain of survival for victims of cardiac arrest is early defibrillation. Mr. President, each minute of the delay in returning the heart to its normal pattern of beating decreases the chance of survival by 10 percent. 
   The final link in the chain is early access to advanced care--it is literally of vital significance. Even after successful defibrillation, many patients require more advanced treatment on the way to the hospital. 
   By passing this legislation, and increasing access to defibrillators, we have the chance to strengthen the more important link in the chain of survival. 
   Communities across America are in dire need of better access to defibrillators. Making AEDs widely available so that trained laypeople can use them to administer shocks to cardiac arrest victims will go a long way toward saving lives. 
   In fact, the American Heart Association estimates that over 50,000 lives could be saved each year if AEDs were more readily accessible.  
   This next chart illustrates a startling statistic I mentioned a moment ago--for every minute that passes a cardiac arrest victim is defibrillated, the chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent. After only eight minutes, the victims survival rate drops 60 percent. 
   Our legislation, the Access to Emergency Devices Act of 2000 takes a common sense approach to strengthen this chain of survival. This legislation provides $25 million to expand access to devices that can save lives across rural America. 
   It also provides for training grants to give people the training they need to learn how to operate defibrillators. 
   And I have learned that training is very important, but also that nearly anyone can be taught to make proper use of a defibrillator. 
   Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast access to defibrillators and are making them available to emergency responders. This legislation recognizes that rural communities should have the same chance to improve cardiac arrest survival rates. 
   Because the first emergency responders on the scene of a cardiac arrest may not always be the medical responders, our legislation makes resources available to rural communities to purchase AEDs for police and fire as well as emergency response vehicles--and our bill also provides funds for the training that will sustain the lifesaving effect of these grants. 
   Cardiac arrest can be a killer. But if we give people in rural communities a chance, they may be able to stop a cardiac arrest before it takes another life. Our bill is a simple and effective way to increase the availability of defibrillators, and give rural victims of cardiac arrest a better chance of survival, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment in the failure of the conferees to the African Growth and Opportunity Act to accept the Feinstein-Feingold amendment regarding HIV/AIDS drugs in Africa. When the Senate was debating that legislation last year, Senator FEINSTEIN and I offered our amendment, which was accepted by the bill's managers, Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN, to address a critically important issue--an issue relating to Africa's devastating AIDS crisis; an issue that has cast a dark shadow on U.S.-African relations in the past. 
   Our amendment was simple. It prohibited the United States Government  or any agent of the United States Government from pressuring African countries to revoke or change laws aimed at increasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question adhere to existing international regulations governing trade. Quite simply, our amendment told the executive branch to stop twisting arms of African countries that are using legal means to improve access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals for their people. 
   The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, allows for compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency. Approximately 13 million African lives have been lost since the onset of the crisis. According to the Rockefeller Foundation's recent report, ``on statistics alone, young people from the most affected countries in Africa are more likely than not to perish of AIDS.'' Consider that: more likely than not to perish. If these do not constitute emergency conditions, then I don't know what does. 
   This was a very modest amendment to begin with, but the final version of the amendment discussed by the conferees was a true compromise. It was not as strong as I would have liked it to be. But it did push our policy closer to the right thing. I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator ROTH, and their staffs for working so hard on this amendment. Senator FEINSTEIN was a tireless advocate on this issue, and I have no doubt that she will continue to fight, as will I, for the right thing when it comes to access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals. And Senator ROTH, in particular, made it a priority to hammer out this issue, and I thank him for that. 
   But despite these efforts, despite the concessions that Senator FEINSTEIN and I made, despite the fact that this is the right thing to do, the Feinstein-Feingold amendment was stripped in conference. The opposition to our amendment is baffling. How do the conferees who killed this provision justify pressuring these countries, where in some cases life expectancies have dropped by more than 15 years, not to use all legal means at their disposal to care for their citizens? Without broader access to these drugs in Africa, more people will suffer, more people will die--that is a simple fact. 
   As I said on this floor not long ago, I cannot imagine that ordinary Americans are urging their representatives to oppose the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. I cannot imagine that anyone would try to prevail upon my colleagues to oppose this measure--except perhaps for pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical industry does not fear losing customers in Africa, because they know that Africans simply cannot afford their prices. But they do fear that taking this modest step in this time of crisis could somehow, in some ill-defined scenario in the future, cut into their bottom line. This is the same pharmaceutical and medical supplies industry that gave more than $4 million in PAC money contributions and more than $6.5 million in soft money contributions in 1997 and 1998. 
   How could this irresponsible and callous decision to strip the Feinstein-Feingold amendment from the conference have been made? I have some idea. Some may have bowed to the pressure of the pharmaceutical industry. And some members just don't get it. 
   In particular, some of the public comments about this issue made over the weekend by a leading Member of this body demonstrated such a misunderstanding of the problem that they cannot go unanswered. 
   Over the weekend, some troubling remarks were made about the administration's recognition that HIV/AIDS, an infectious disease that currently affects 34 million people worldwide, is a security issue. 
   First, a leader of this body disputed the fact that AIDS is a security issue. He is wrong. Anyone who believes that a dramatic drop in population, a massive reversal in economic growth, a societal disruption of unprecedented proportions, an entire generation of orphans growing up on the streets--anyone who believes that those things are not destabilizing is terribly misguided. Anyone who does not understand that the U.S. will be profoundly affected by the terrible consequences of AIDS in the developing world had better think again. 
   But it didn't stop there. It went further. It was suggested that the administration is using the issue cynically to appeal to ``certain groups'' who were not identified. 
   Is it pandering to ``certain groups'' to stand up and say that a disease that infects more than 15,000 young people each day is an issue of grave concern? Is it political posturing to get serious about the massive destabilization that can occur when the most productive segment of a society is wiped out by disease? Is it only some mysterious narrow constituency that is concerned about the prospect of millions of orphans growing up on the streets, without any guidance or education? After witnessing the shocking violence that resulted, in large part, from the masterful manipulation of disenfranchised youth in West Africa over the last decade, I think we all have to take this threat seriously, and acknowledge that the threat is fueled each day by the withering scourge of AIDS that today is galloping through so much of the developing world. 
   Let me just paint a portrait of the region most affected by AIDS--sub-Saharan Africa. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa, I have always felt very strongly about the issue of AIDS in Africa. I have raised it in meetings with African heads of state. I applauded the U.N. Security Council's decision to address the crisis earlier this year. I support the administration's call to increase the resources directed at the crisis, and I am glad that the U.S. is finally getting serious about this threat. 
   Thirteen million Africans have been killed by AIDS since the onset of the crisis, and according to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, the disease has left 10 million orphaned African children in its wake. 
   In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, 25 percent of the people between the ages of 15 and 19 are HIV positive. 
   By 2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people than it would have had if there had been no AIDS epidemic. That is why we must acknowledge that the AIDS epidemic is becoming a crucial part of the context for all that happens in Africa and for all of our policy decisions about Africa. 
   Until this week this Senate has been moving in the right direction on these issues. I have been pleased to work with many of my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to raise the profile of the epidemic and to work toward a comprehensive package aimed at addressing this crisis. It disturbs me a great deal to think that Members of this body have somehow failed to hear us, or perhaps refused to listen. 
   This is not a partisan issue. It is deadly serious. I plead with all of my colleagues to look again at the AIDS epidemic in Africa and to consider its global implications. 
   Those implications are fast becoming strategic and economic realities that will kill millions and drag down all of our efforts on international development and the promotion of freedom and stability around the world. We need to get our heads out of the sand right now, resist the impulse to gain partisan advantage, and join together to seek solutions to the AIDS crisis before we reap global disaster. 
   U.S. policy on access to HIV/AIDS drugs will come up again in this body. All of the complex issues relating to this crisis--prevention strategies, care for orphans, mother to child transmission--none of these issues is going away. And while this Congress fails to do the right thing, while some fail to grasp the magnitude of the epidemic and its consequences, AIDS will continue to take its terrible toll on families and communities, on economies, and on stability around the world. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator WELLSTONE is on the floor at this point. I want to join my colleagues and speak regarding our good friend, Mike Epstein, and I send my thoughts to Mike as well. This is a wonderful place to work in the Senate and in this community. But it is a tough town. Mike Epstein is one of the warmest, best people I have ever met. For a while, I was a little jealous that he worked for Senator WELLSTONE, until I found out that Senator WELLSTONE, with Mike Epstein, is a team operation. Whenever I needed encouragement out here and Paul wasn't around, or somebody from my office, all I had to do is turn back and look at Mike who would give me a warm smile and good advice. He is a good friend. I am proud to be associated with Mike and to have worked with him over the years.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, following Senator WELLSTONE's excellent remarks on education, I want to speak on the bill before us. I rise to add my thoughts to this important debate about the future of the Federal role in the education of America's children. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act has shaped the Federal role in public elementary and secondary education for 35 years. Yesterday, we began the debate on a new 5-year reauthorization of this vital set of programs. This debate will also set the tone for the Federal role in education for the next 5 years and beyond. 
   The legislation that this Congress passes this year will affect today's first graders well into their middle school years, and will carry today's eighth graders through to their high school commencements. 
   We hold the future in our hands, Mr. President. It is our responsibility to find the right balance between local control and Federal targeting and accountability guidelines for the federal dollars that are so crucial to local school districts throughout the United States. 
   Ninety percent of American children attend public schools. During the 1998-1999 school year, the most recent year for which statistics are available, more than 879,000 young people in my home State of Wisconsin were enrolled in public education, from pre-school through grade twelve. I am a graduate of the Wisconsin public schools, and my children have also attended them. 
   Mr. President, just a few short years ago the members of the other body considered eliminating the federal Department of Education all together. Some tried to evoke the specter of a federal takeover of one of the basic responsibilities of local governments--the education of our children. But those voices have faded in recent years as the Department of Education, under the dedicated leadership of Secretary Richard Riley, has regained the confidence of the American people and dispelled the charge that it was out to usurp the authority of the local school districts and the states. 
   I am deeply concerned by the persistent calls by some in Congress and elsewhere for a drastically limited federal involvement in our children's education. While I strongly support maintaining local control over decisions affecting our children's day-to-day classroom experiences, I am concerned  about the lack of appropriated targeting of funds and accountability for results in the bill that is currently before the Senate. 
   Mr. President, the legislation before us today has generated vigorous debate in my home state of Wisconsin. I have heard from parents, teachers, school board members, school administrators, school counselors and social workers, state officials, and other interested observers. And there is one central theme in their comments: The United States Congress must not undermine the targeting and accountability measures that currently exist at the Federal level. These provisions are paramount to ensuring that no students are left behind and that all schools perform up to the standards set by the states and by local school districts. 
   I have also heard from a number of my constituents that this Congress should do nothing that would undermine all the good that the federal government's support has helped the states and local school districts achieve in public education over the last several years, in areas including smaller class sizes, technology education, standards-based reform, and accountability for results. 
   The education community in my state is also deeply concerned--and I share this concern--about provisions in this legislation that would shift scarce Federal dollars away from the public schools they are intended to support. 
   I fear that this disturbing trend toward block granting and vouchers will further widen the educational divide in which too many of our students are caught. We need to focus our scarce resources on rebuilding and reforming our public schools, not on tearing them down. 
   I worry that this block grant and voucher-driven weeding-out process will leave behind the most vulnerable students--those from low-income families, those with special needs, those at-risk for dropping out, and those with behavioral problems--those very students that title I was created to help. We cannot and must not abandon our most at-risk students in dilapidated schools with outdated textbooks and few resources. We can and must do better for all of our children. The answer is not to funnel scarce resources away from the public school systems that have served this country so well for so long. 
   And those who think vouchers will lead to real school choice are sadly mistaken. Private schools are already full to capacity and many have extensive waiting lists. We cannot simply shift students from public schools to private schools and think that all of the problems will magically disappear. 
   Mr. President, we will hear a lot of terms batted back and forth during this debate.--Accountability. Flexibility. Targeting. Parental involvement. Class size. Construction and maintenance. Teacher quality. Professional development. After-school programs. Education technology. School choice. School reform.--These concepts are at the heart of this debate. The question lies in how these terms are defined. I sincerely hope that the members of this body will be able to leave behind the partisan rancor that unfortunately pervaded the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee's consideration of this bill and come together to do what is best for all of our Nation's children. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some of my own priorities--and those of my constituents--for this important piece of legislation: class size, targeting, professional development, music and the arts, and the impact of this bill on preparation for post-secondary education and entrance into the job market. 
   I regret that this bill as reported by the HELP Committee does not contain the authorization for the funds necessary to implement the third year of the President's initiative to reduce class size in the earliest grades. And I particularly regret that this commonsense proposal was defeated in committee on a straight party-line vote. 
   My home State of Wisconsin is a leader in the effort to reduce class size in kindergarten through third grade. The Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program is a statewide effort to reduce class size in kindergarten through third grade to 15 students. 
   The SAGE program began during the 1996-1997 school year with 30 participating schools in 21 school districts. Now in the program's fourth year, there are 78 participating schools in 46 school districts. 
   According to the recently-released program evaluation for the 1998-1999 school year, conducted by the SAGE Evaluation Team at the University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee: 
   First grade students in SAGE classrooms statistically outperformed their peers in comparison schools in language arts, math, and total scores on the post-tests administered in May of 1999. And twenty-nine of the thirty top-performing classrooms for which two years of data were available are SAGE classrooms. 
   Case studies conducted at three SAGE schools during the 1998-1999 school year found that, ``individualization is made possible because having fewer students enables teachers to know students better, it reduces the need for teachers to discipline students, which results in more time for instruction, and it increases teacher enthusiasm for teaching.'' 
   The case study also found that: ``A product of individualization in reduced size classes in addition to academic development is student independence, thinking, and responsibility.'' 
   The results speak for themselves, Mr. President. Smaller classes translate to better instruction and better achievement. 
   I will support efforts to include this important program in this bill. 
   As I noted earlier, one of the things that my constituents have repeatedly told me is that the targeting mechanisms that ensure that vital federal dollars reach those students who need them most are a crucial part of any ESEA reauthorization. Time and time again, my constituents have expressed opposition to any effort to block grant title I and other programs under ESEA. 
   Title I pays for supplementary educational services for economically disadvantaged students, and those funds are targeted to the schools with the highest concentrations of eligible students. During the current school year, local school districts in my home State of Wisconsin will receive more than $125 million in title I funding. According to the Department of Education, ninety-five percent of the nation's highest-poverty schools receive this vital title I funding. 
   I am deeply concerned about the so-called ``portability'' provisions in this bill, which would allow ten states and twenty local education agencies in other states to distribute their Title I money on a per-pupil basis rather than to the schools with the greatest need. This funding formula would allow parents to choose to use their child's share of these ``portable grants'' for supplementary services at their public school or for private tutoring services, which could be provided by private or religious schools. 
   This formula will all but ensure that those schools with the highest concentration of poor children in the ten states and twenty districts using the portable grants will no longer be able to count on this crucial Title I support. 
   And this provision also raises serious constitutional questions about the use of public funds for tutoring provided by non-public sources. 
   In addition, there is no clear way to determine accountability for the success of those children whose parents opt for non-public tutoring services. 
   I will support efforts to eliminate the portability language and ensure that Title I funding continues to be targeted to the schools with the highest concentrations of low-income students. 
   I have also heard a great deal about the importance of federal dollars for professional development for teachers, administrators, principals, and school counselors and social workers. We must do everything we can to ensure that teachers and other school professionals have access to the resources they need to continue their professional development. We often hear people say that we should encourage our children to become ``lifetime learners.'' We must also ensure that those who educate our children have access to quality professional development programs that enhance their effectiveness and give them access to the latest methods in teaching, administration, and counseling. 
   In that same regard, we must ensure that our children have the opportunity to receive a well-rounded education  that is both academically challenging and rich in opportunities to study music and the arts. I am deeply concerned that many school systems around the country have decided to eliminate, or to severely scale back, their arts education programs. Research has shown that arts education can help students to become better learners in all subject areas. 
   The arts given students the opportunity to express themselves in ways that are distinct from those provided by the academic subjects. Students learn valuable lessons including cooperation, hard work, dedication, and the desire to strive for excellence--lessons that will help them in other areas of their education and in other aspects of their lives. 
   We must do all we can to prevent local school systems from having to choose between maintaining the arts as a vital part of their curriculum or building a new science lab. Both are important for our students, and one should not have to be sacrificed to have the other. 
   Finally, Mr. President, we must ensure that high school graduates have the skills they need to be successful adults, whether they choose to go on to college, technical school, the military, or into the job market. 
   I am pleased that the HELP Committee adopted an amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, which authorizes additional funding to expand a very successful existing program which increases access to Advanced Placement classes and exams. It is extremely important that we continue to strive to give all students, regardless of their economic status, access to these challenging academic courses. 
   And it is important that the Congress also help to provide the financial assistance that so many students need to continue their education. For that reason, I will continue my efforts, along with the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, and others, to increase the individual maximum Pell Grant award by $400. 
   Mr. President, I wish to again remind my colleagues that this bill currently before us will affect 90 percent of the school-aged children in this country. While many of them have never even heard of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, they will feel the impact of its pending reauthorization in their classrooms beginning next fall. I welcome this important debate. I hope that we can produce a truly bipartisan bill that will provide the financial assistance that our children deserve and the appropriate targeting and accountability measures that our states and local school districts continue to call for. And I hope we will do this without creating a system of block grants and back-door vouchers that will leave our most vulnerable children behind. 
   I thank the chair. I yield the floor.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory of Grace Walsh of Eau Claire, WI, who passed away on Monday, April 24. I will remember Grace as a wonderful person and brilliant teacher, someone who taught me lessons in debate and in life that I have relied on so often throughout my career in public service. 
   Grace coached her debate team to six national championships at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, where she co-founded the Speech Department and served as both a professor and director of forensics. During the summer of 1970 when I was still in high school, I was lucky enough to study debate with Grace at the Eau Claire Debate Institute. Grace was a consummate teacher who brought out the best in her students, and a fierce competitor who built a debating dynasty in Eau Claire. With warmth, wit, and a mastery of forensics, Grace quickly won her students' respect. While small in size, Grace was commanding in stature, thanks to her keen understanding of how to coach winning debaters. ``Always slip them the blade nicely,'' she told us. 
   Many years after I attended that summer debating program at Eau Claire, I saw Grace again. I gave a talk in Eau Claire after I won an upset victory in the Democratic primary in 1992, and who was in the front row but Grace Walsh, urging me again to ``slip them the blade nicely, Russell.'' She was still coaching me, and displaying a love of debate that made her a coaching legend in Wisconsin and around the country. 
   Grace passed away last week at the age of 89, but her spirit lives on through all those who knew her and had the opportunity to learn from her. As her student, I am grateful for her guidance, and as a Wisconsinite, I am proud of her many achievements. Her work did honor to our state, and I think it only fitting that we pause to honor and remember her here today.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may remember, during the first session of this Congress I initiated the Calling of the Bankroll. It is a time when I come to the floor to chronicle the massive amount of PAC and soft money pumped into the campaign finance system by donors looking to influence the work we do here on this floor. 
   I called the bankroll many times last year--19 times, to be exact. 
   And I included not just donations by business interests but from interests on both sides of these debates, including trial lawyers and gun control advocates. 
   Last year when I began my Calling of the Bankroll effort, I did so because I thought it was time for someone in this body finally to talk about what we all think about and what the American people really are quite angry about; and that is, how money can influence what we do here and how we do it. 
   I know that this is an uncomfortable topic, and I know full well that there are some who would prefer that I stop Calling the Bankroll--that there are those who wish that I would stop putting the spotlight on facts that reflect poorly on our system, and in turn on the Senate, and on both major political parties. 
   I have to tell you, Mr. President, no one wishes I could stop Calling the Bankroll as much as I do. 
   I wish wealthy interests with business before this body didn't have unlimited ability to give money to our political parties through the soft money loophole, but they do. 
   I wish these big donors weren't able to buy special access to our political leaders through meetings and weekend retreats set up by the parties, but they can. 
   I wish fundraising skills and personal wealth weren't some of the most sought-after qualities in a candidate for Congress today, but everyone knows that they are. 
   Most of all, I wish that these facts didn't paint a picture of Government so corrupt and so awash in the influence of money that the American people, especially young people, have turned away from their Government in disgust, but every one of us knows that they have. 
   But I also know something else: that we have the power to change this embarrassing state of affairs. 
   Here in the Senate we have the power to show the American people that we have the will to shut down the soft money system. 
   As I said, I Called the Bankroll 19 times last year--and I could have done it even more times. 
   Unfortunatey there is never a shortage of material. 
   When I Call the Bankroll I describe how much money the various interests lobbying on a particular bill have spent on campaign contributions to influence our decisions.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here, along with the Senator from California, who I believe is one of the most determined and effective Members of the Senate, to talk about a very important matter. 
   Last year, when this Senate was debating the African Growth and Opportunity Act, Senator FEINSTEIN and I offered an amendment to that legislation, which was accepted by the bill's managers Senators ROTH and MOYNIHAN, to address to critically important issue--an issue relating to Africa's devastating AIDS crisis; an issue that has cast a dark shadow on US-African relations in the past. 
   Our amendment was simple--and I want to clarify this point, because  there has been some misleading characterizations of it in print recently. It prohibited any agent of the United States Government from pressuring African countries to revoke or change laws aimed at increasing access to HIV/AIDS drugs, so long as the laws in question adhered to existing international regulations governing trade. Quite simply, our amendment told the executive branch to stop twisting the arms of African countries that are using legal means to improve access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals for their people. 
   The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, or TRIPS, allows for compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency. HIV/AIDS kills 5,500 Africans every day. Approximately 13 million African lives have been lost since the onset of the crisis. According to the Rockefeller Foundation's recent report, ``on statistics alone, young people from the most affected countries in Africa are more likely than not to perish of AIDS.'' 
   In contrast to this incredible crisis, is a very modest amendment. This year a number of our colleagues have offered very ambitious proposals--many of which I support--aimed at addressing the AIDS crisis in Africa because they have been moved by the severity of the crisis, by the scope of the devastation, by the human tragedy of millions lost to disease and a generation of orphans left in their wake. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee recently reported out legislation combining many of these efforts in one integrated plan to get serious about this crisis. Time and again, Members of this Senate on a bipartisan basis have stepped forward to implore their colleagues to do more to help. 
   What is ironic is that this amendment was far less ambitious. It simply took a step toward requiring the United States to do no harm. Yet the conferees working on the African Growth and Opportunity Act are resisting this measure every step of the way. I find the resistance to this measure baffling. They try to skirt the issue, pointing out that prevention programs, not access to drugs, are the most important element in the fight against AIDS. 
   I couldn't agree more. But why does the fact that the Feinstein-Feingold amendment addresses only one small piece of the puzzle prevent us from making it law? Why on earth should we forgo an opportunity to do no harm even as we strive to form a broader plan of action to do some good? How can anyone justify pressuring these countries, where in some cases life expectancies have dropped by more than fifteen years, not to use all legal means at their disposal to care for their citizens? I simply cannot understand it; I cannot imagine that ordinary Americans are urging their representatives to oppose the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. I cannot imagine that anyone would prevail upon my colleagues to oppose this measure--except perhaps for pharmaceutical companies, companies that know they would not lose customers in Africa, as Africans simply cannot afford their prices, but fear that this measure would somehow, somewhere down the road, affect their bottom line. 
   The bottom line in Africa is that AIDS represents that worst infectious disease catastrophe since the bubonic plague. The bottom line is that this is a modest measure and it is the right thing to do. I along with the Senator from California, urge the conferees to support it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the 1.5 million ethnic Armenians that were systematically murdered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire from 1915-1923. The 85th anniversary of the beginning of this brutal annihilation was marked on April 24. 
   During this nine year period, a total of 1.75 million ethnic Armenians were either slaughtered or forced to flee their homes to escape the certain death that awaited them at the hands of a government-sanctioned force determined to extinguish their very existence. As a result, fewer than 80,000 ethnic Armenians remain in what is present-day Turkey. 
   I have come to the floor to commemorate this horrific chapter in human history each year I have been a member of this body, both to honor those who died and to remind the American people of the chilling capacity for violence that, unfortunately, still exists in the world. It is all too clear from the current ethnically and religiously motivated conflicts in such places as the Balkans, Sierra Leone, and Sudan that we have not learned the lessons of the past. 
   Recently, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, of which I am a member, had the honor of hearing the testimony of one of the most well-known survivors of the Holocaust, Dr. Elie Wiesel. His eloquent words remind us that the same capacity for hate that drove the Ottoman Empire to murder ethnic Armenians and the Nazis to murder Jews is still present in the world. At the hearing, Dr. Wiesel said, ``violence is the language of those who can no longer express themselves with words.'' 
   This hate manifests itself in many ways, from extreme nationalism to so-called ``ethnic cleansing'' to violations of the basic human rights of ethnic and religious minorities. And, in some cases, those filled with hate attempt to mimic the horrific events and beliefs of times past. For example, I am deeply disturbed by the apparent resurgence of right wing and anti-Semitic movements in Europe. 
   Dr. Wiesel also said, ``to hate is to deny the other person's humanity.'' Today, let us take a moment to remember the Armenians who died at the hands of the Ottoman Empire, and all of the other innocent people who have lost their lives in the course of human history simply for who they were. Our humanity may depend on it.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000. This bill would place an immediate pause on executions in the United States while a national, blue ribbon commission reviews the administration of the death penalty. Before one more execution is carried out, jurisdictions that impose the death penalty have an obligation to ensure that the sentence of death will be imposed with justice, fairness, and due process. I am pleased that my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, has joined me as a cosponsor of this important initiative. 
   If a particular aircraft crashed one out of every eight flights, Congress would act immediately to ground it. But as New York public defender Kevin Doyle says in the book, Actual Innocence, that is about what is happening now with the death penalty in this country. Since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty, 87 people have been freed from death row because they were later proven innocent. That is a demonstrated error rate of 1 innocent person for every 7 persons executed. When the consequences are life and death, we need to demand the same standard for our system of justice as we would for our airlines. 
   Both supporters and opponents of the death penalty should be concerned about the flaws in the system by which we impose sentences of death. More than 3,600 inmates sit on State and Federal death rows around the country, while it becomes increasingly clear that innocent people are being put to death. 
   A 1987 study found that between 1900 and 1985, 350 people convicted of capital crimes in the United States were innocent of the crimes charged. Some escaped execution by minutes. Regrettably, according to researchers Radelet and Bedau, 23 had their lives taken from them in error. 
   In Illinois, since 1973, 13 innocent people have been freed from death row in the time that 12 were executed. Governor George Ryan, a supporter of the death penalty, has done two things in response: He has effectively imposed a moratorium on executions and established a blue ribbon commission to review the administration of capital punishment in Illinois. Governor Ryan and I are from different political parties, but we both recognize that the system by which we impose the death penalty is broken. 
   Modern DNA testing of forensic evidence led to the exoneration of 5 of the 13 innocents freed from Illinois' death row and 8 of the 87 men and women who have been freed from death row nationwide since the 1970's. But Illinois and New York are the only states that currently provide some measure of access to DNA testing for death row inmates. My distinguished colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, has introduced a bill, the Innocence Protection Act, of which I am a co-sponsor, that would ensure access to DNA testing for all inmates on death row in the Federal system and the 38 States that impose the death penalty. That bill is an important initiative to help ensure that innocents are not condemned to death. I hope my colleagues will join Senator LEAHY in moving this bill forward. 
   But, as Governor Ryan and others have recognized, flaws in our system unfortunately go well beyond access to DNA testing. As 
   Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer note in their book, ``Actual Innocence,''  
   Sometimes eyewitnesses make mistakes. Snitches tell lies. Confessions are coerced or fabricated. Racism trumps truth. Lab tests are rigged. Defense lawyers sleep.  
   Indeed, Scheck and Neufeld note that eyewitness error is the single most important cause of wrongful convictions.  As important as DNA testing is, it is only the first step in addressing the host of problems in the administration of capital punishment. 
   It is time for the Congress to take the lead and declare once and for all that it is unacceptable to execute an innocent man or woman. It is a central pillar of our criminal justice system that it is better that many guilty people go free than that one innocent should suffer. Sadly, history has demonstrated that time and again, America has brought innocence itself to the bar and condemned it to die. That history now demonstrates that even in America, innocence itself has provided no security from the ultimate punishment. 
   Most insidiously, the ghosts of institutional racism still haunt our courthouses. They intrude when lawyers select jurors, during the presentation of evidence, when the prosecutor contrasts the race of the victim and defendant, and when juries deliberate. The evidence mounts that the United States applies the death penalty differently to people of different races. 
   The numbers tell the story: Although African-Americans constitute only 13 percent of the American population, since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, African-Americans account for 35 percent of those executed, 43 percent of those who wait on death row nationwide, and 67 percent of those who wait on death row in the Federal system. Although only 50 percent of murder victims are white, fully 84 percent of the victims in death penalty cases were white. Since 1976, America has executed 11 whites for killing an African-American, but has executed 144 African-Americans for killing a white. 
   Governor Ryan and Illinois serve as a model for the Congress and the Nation. The flaws in the Illinois criminal justice system are not unique. Problems like convicting the innocent, racial disparities in the application of the death penalty, and inadequacy of defense counsel have plagued the administration of capital punishment across the Nation. That is why we need a national review of the death penalty and a suspension of executions until we can be sure that death row inmates across the country have been given the full protections of justice, fairness, and due process. 
   Governor Ryan is not alone in questioning the state of the death penalty. In the last few months, people of all political stripes have been stepping forward to say there is a problem and it is time to do something about it. 
   Columnist George Will recently wrote that serious defects exist in the criminal justice system by which we impose capital punishment. In a recent column in The Washington Post, George Will wrote that accounts of the wrongly convicted compel the conclusion that ``many innocent people are in 
   prison, and some innocent people have been executed.'' He also wrote that even though he continues to believe that capital punishment may be a deterrent to crime, it can only be an effective deterrent if the criminal justice system operates properly to convict and sentence those who actually committed the offense, not innocent people. 
   The Reverend Pat Robertson, a founder of the Christian Coalition and a long-time supporter of the death penalty, has also recognized that something is terribly amiss in the administration of the death penalty. At a recent conference at the College of William and Mary, Reverend Robertson noted that the death penalty has been administered in a way that discriminates against minorities and the poor who cannot afford high-priced defense attorneys. Reverend Robertson said, ``these are all reasons to at least slow down.'' He also said, ``I think a moratorium would indeed be very appropriate.'' 
   Around the country, other State and local legislative bodies have also urged pause and reflection. At least 17 city and county governments have now passed resolutions supporting a moratorium on executions. And resolutions have been offered in the legislatures of several states, including Alabama, Maryland, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Washington state. In 1997, the American Bar Association adopted a resolution calling for a nationwide moratorium on executions. Recently, the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and a number of other religious organizations called on the President to suspend the scheduling of executions and initiate a review of the administration of capital punishment at the Federal level. These local governments and organizations have recognized that a little time and a little reflection are not much to ask when the lives of innocent people may hang in the balance. 
   Congress, too, should recognize that a little time and reflection are not too much to ask. That is why I ask my colleagues to support the bill I introduce today. This bill simply calls on the Federal Government and all States that impose the death penalty to suspend executions while a national commission reviews the administration of the death penalty. The Commission would study all matters relating to the administration of the death penalty at the Federal and State levels to determine whether it comports with constitutional principles and requirements of fairness, justice, equality and due process. Congress would review the Commission's final report and then enact or reject its recommendations. Those jurisdictions that impose capital punishment could resume executions only after Congress considers the Commission's final report and repeals the suspension of executions provision of the bill. 
   This means that before executing even one more person, the Federal Government and the States must ensure that not a single innocent person will be executed, eliminate discrimination in capital sentencing on the basis of the race of either the victim or the defendant, and provide for certain basic standards of competency of defense counsel. 
   Questions about the administration of the death penalty can only be answered with an impartial, independent review. 
   The blue-ribbon commission called for in my bill would include prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, law enforcement officials, and other distinguished Americans with experience or expertise in the issue. It would be a balanced commission, not chock full of death penalty foes or death penalty supporters representing different viewpoints on the issue. Other nations, including some of our closest allies, have also established national commissions to review the death penalty. 
   In the 1950s, Great Britain created the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, and the Canadian Parliament established a joint committee of their Senate and House to review capital punishment. Now, almost 50 years later, I believe it is time for the United States to undertake a national review. We should be the leader on issues of justice. 
   It has been almost 25 years since the reinstatement of the death penalty, and we still don't know how innocent people got on death row or how to prevent it from happening again. That is embarrassing, at the least, for the world's greatest democracy. My bill is a step in the right direction. And the time is now. Our Nation has come to the point where the machinery of death is well greased, and the pace of executions has accelerated. Last year, our Nation hit an all-time high for total executions in any 1 year since 1976. We had 98 executions last year in America. This year, we are already on track to meet or exceed that same high rate. 
   Before our Government takes the life of even one more citizen, it has a solemn responsibility to every American to prove that its actions are consistent with our Nation's fundamental principles of justice, equality, and due process. Before carrying out an irreversible punishment, the Government must carefully consider the tough questions surrounding capital punishment. 
   Mr. President, let us slow the machinery of death to ensure we are being fair. Let us reflect to ensure that we are being just. Let us pause to be certain we do not kill a single innocent person. This is really not too much to ask for a civilized society. I urge my colleagues to join me and my distinguished colleague, Senator LEVIN, in sponsoring the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I voted against a motion to close debate on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 3, a victims' rights constitutional amendment. Only twelve Senators voted no, although a far larger number oppose this resolution. I was prepared to vote yes on the motion, because the rights of victims are terribly important and a resolution like this ought to be thoroughly debated. But before the vote I learned that the language of this resolution to amend the Constitution is still being negotiated. This ought to be a solemn, soberly undertaken effort, for it presumes to revise the work of Madison and Hamilton and those great Americans who put to paper the ingenious design of the American republic in that hot Philadelphia room 224 years ago. But instead, we were asked today to begin that debate in earnest while the supporters of the resolution were still off in a room somewhere trying to agree on the language of the resolution. 
   So I said no. I said no to this casual, cavalier approach to amending the Constitution. It does not respect the seriousness of the process and has led to constitutional profligacy in the Congress--to hundreds of constitutional amendments being offered as if they were not gravely important, as if they were not an attempt to edit the organic law that has held our democracy together for two centuries. In the opening days of some recent Congresses, we have seen constitutional amendments introduced at a rate of more than one per day. 
   A few weeks ago, we considered a constitutional amendment to allow prohibition of flag desecration. I opposed that amendment, but I didn't oppose cloture on the motion to proceed. I voted for cloture because the backers of the flag amendment, wrong as I thought they were, at least showed some respect for the process. They believed there was a need for the amendment and they were able to point to particular events and precedents that they believed needed to be addressed. But no court has struck down the dozens of state constitution provisions and hundreds of statutes that protect victims' rights across America today, so why rush to amend the Constitution? The backers of the flag amendment argued, correctly, that their goal of allowing prohibition of some forms of speech could be realized only by a constitutional amendment. They offered a resolution that had been refined over time, whose supporters at least, had agreed upon. All of us were aware, long before the vote, what the resolution said. The vote on proceeding to the flag debate was not held in a fluid situation, where negotiations about language that might end up in our Constitution were still talking place. So we voted as Senators to proceed and we did proceed to a sober, deliberate and thoughtful debate and an informed vote about the flag amendment. 
   Today, on the victims rights amendment, the process was not respected. The Senate acquiesced in a casual exercise in constitutional improvisation, shunning the statutory alternatives that are readily available, to embrace the near immutability of constitutional language. So I voted no--to say we are not ready to have this debate, but we will have the debate and we may now add one more reason to the many reasons to oppose this resolution: its proponents have not respected the process and we are obliged to assume that their constitutional amendment, even if it were right in its general substance, must be flawed in its language and details.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to oppose S.J. Res. 3, the victims' rights constitutional amendment. I agree with the goals of the proponents of the amendment. We have to do more to protect and enhance the rights of victims of crime. But I disagree with the particular means they have chosen to bring about that end. We do not need to amend the Constitution to protect victims. We can protect the rights of victims by enforcing current State and Federal laws. We can protect the rights of victims by providing the needed resources to prosecutors and courts to allow them to enforce and comply with existing laws. We can protect the rights of victims by enacting additional statutes, if needed, to deal with remaining concerns or any issues that  might arise in this regard in the future. 
   The framers of the Constitution made the process of amending the Constitution very difficult. Those who propose to change that long-lived and successful charter bear a heavy burden. I have thus opposed proposals to amend the Constitution, and especially the Bill of Rights, even when the subject of the amendment was very close to my heart, as it was with the recent proposal to amend the Constitution to allow for mandatory campaign spending limits. Similarly, I believe deeply in the need to ensure that our criminal justice system treats victims fairly, but I do not believe we have to amend the Constitution to do so. 
   Throughout history, Members of Congress have thought of more than 11,000 different ways to amend the Constitution--as 
   of this last recess, 11,045, by one count. Luckily, only 27 have become part of our national charter. Ten of those, the Bill of Rights, were part of the package of ratification, and two, the ones on prohibition, canceled each other. Three others followed the enormous upheaval of the Civil War and addressed the wrongs of slavery and inequality that spawned that conflict. But the pace at which Members have introduced and proposed amendments has picked up in modern times. More than half of the constitutional amendments proposed in the entire lifetime of our Nation have come in the last 40 years. Fewer were proposed in the first 173 years of our Nation. This Senate has now considered three so far in this session alone--and the year is still young. 
   In a sense, there is a certain lack of humility about proposing so quickly to amend the Constitution. To propose to change the Constitution now is to say we have come up with an idea that the framers of that great charter did not, or that we have come to a conclusion on how our Government should work fundamentally different from the one they had and fundamentally different from the one all the Congresses since have had. We should come hesitantly, if we do, to the conclusion that we know better than they did. Yes, there will come occasions where times have changed, as with women's right to vote, and we need to bring the Constitution up to date; but it is hard to consider the basic calculus of prosecutor, defendant, and victim to have changed this much since the foundation of the Republic. 
   I have to admit that of the constitutional amendments I have seen proposed in recent Congresses, this is less objectionable in some respects than most. But I still have significant concerns about the prospect of amending the Constitution, even for this very worthy purpose. We must use the constitutional amendment process sparingly. Before taking the grave step of amending our country's founding charter, we have to make sure we have exhausted all statutory alternatives. When it comes to victims' rights, we are far from exhausting those statutory alternatives. We currently have Federal and State laws protecting victims. Indeed, many States have passed their own constitutional amendments to protect victims, including my own State of Wisconsin--a proposal that I voted for when I was in the Wisconsin State Senate. 
   According to the proponents of this constitutional amendment, these existing laws are not being fully enforced. I would say we should therefore see to it that the existing laws are enforced. Let us enact legislation to improve the existing law, and let us provide the needed resources to prosecutors and courts to comply with existing laws. That is where the real struggle lies. Only when we have exhausted these legislative avenues should we possibly consider a constitutional amendment. 
   Let's address this important issue one step at a time. Statutes protecting victims are on the books in each and every State. Amendments to State constitutions have been adopted by at least 31 States. At the Federal level, prudent legislation has already been enacted and additional legislation proposed. Let us work with the current law and proposals to improve our Federal laws. In fact, additional statutory protections for victims have been introduced during this Congress by Chairman HATCH and by the ranking member and Senator KENNEDY. I believe these represent the right direction in which to go. 
   Chairman HATCH has introduced the Victims' Rights Act of 1999. Senators LEAHY and KENNEDY have introduced the Crime 
   Victims Assistance Act. Senator LEAHY announced an improved version of that bill, taking into account many suggestions made by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I understand Senator LEAHY will offer his bill as a substitute to this constitutional amendment, if the majority leader allows Senators to exercise their traditional rights to offer amendments. 
   Enforcing and enacting comprehensive Federal statutes is the best way to protect victims. The Leahy-Kennedy bill will accomplish the same goals the proponents of this amendment want, but it will do it faster and also protect the integrity of the Constitution. The Leahy-Kennedy bill includes the right for a victim to be heard at the detention and sentencing stages, the right to be notified of escaped or released prisoners, and the right to be heard during consideration of a plea agreement. These are sensible protections that victims can see take effect in only a matter of weeks--the time it takes for consideration and passage of a statute--not years from now when maybe two-thirds of the Congress approves and three-fourths of the States ratify a constitutional amendment. 
   Another reason I oppose this measure is that a constitutional amendment, as you well know, is far less flexible than a statute when provisions must be improved over time. A constitutional amendment cannot easily be modified. Changing it at all--even one letter of it--would again require the approval of two-thirds of the Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the State legislatures. This is a real problem in this case because there are numerous uncertainties about the effect of this amendment. Even the sponsors are finding things they want to change. Each time this amendment has been brought before the Judiciary Committee, it has been different. In fact, the amendment was modified as recently as last spring when we marked it up in the Constitution Subcommittee. At that time, my good friend, Senator ASHCROFT, successfully offered an amendment to include the rights of victims to be involved in the pardon process. Such a change has inspired a good deal of criticism from the executive branch, which is concerned with its impact on the exclusive power of the President to grant pardons. 
   Whatever one thinks of the change to the amendment, it is the sort of thing that ought to give us pause when we are dealing not with a statute but with what is likely to be a permanent constitutional amendment. What if Senator ASHCROFT had not realized that this change was needed until after the pending proposed constitutional amendment was already adopted? What if, instead, we had approved the victims' rights amendment in the last Congress, as I am sure its sponsors would have preferred? Then, to change the amendment, Senator ASHCROFT would have been required to get two-thirds of the Congress and three-fourths of the State legislatures to agree to the change. 
   The pardon issue isn't the end of the matter. Other Senators have raised concerns about the specifics of this amendment; for example, its focus on the victims of violent crimes rather than all victims of crime. If any further changes are needed, we will have to, again, go through the lengthy and difficult process of amending the constitution. I have no doubt that further changes will be necessary. I have heard the main authors of this constitutional amendment saying with some pride that there have been 63 versions of this amendment. They offer that as a sign that this is a very well-honed, carefully drafted piece of legislation or amendment. What I suggest it means is that it is highly volatile, likely to change, and likely to be inappropriate for the Constitution, even after it is ratified, given all the changes that have been made and the problems with it. This constitutional amendment really reads as a statute. 
   It is almost as long as the entire Bill of Rights. It is full of terms and concepts that will undoubtedly provoke years of litigation and years of attempts to overturn a court decision that one group or another doesn't like. 
   It even contains an extraordinary clause that might be called the ``emergency eject button.'' The Government  can ignore the amendment. Remember, this language will be in the Constitution. The Government can ignore the amendment to achieve a ``compelling interest.'' 
   What if the prosecutors in a high-profile case sought to avoid the impact of the amendment and the courts determined the justification they gave did not rise to the level of a compelling interest? If we, as a Congress, agreed with the prosecutors, we would not be able to pass a statute to override that judicial ruling because it would have to actually pass a constitutional amendment to deal with the problem. 
   It is clear that despite years of effort that have gone into this amendment, it will have to be fine-tuned in the future. We fine-tune statutes all the time, but we all know constitutional amendments can't really be fine-tuned. That is a big problem the Senate needs to face up to. 
   This amendment also poses major federalism problems. I am troubled this amendment could well result in extensive oversight of State criminal justice systems by the Federal courts. Victims who believe their rights have not been recognized in State court proceedings will undoubtedly file lawsuits in Federal district courts. Federal courts will end up second-guessing the decisions of State prosecutors or judges about how long a case took to get to trial or what victim should be notified of a bail hearing. That is why the Conference of Chief Justices, representing the chief justices of the supreme courts of all of our States, oppose this amendment and strongly prefer that we deal with this problem statutorily. 
   The State chief justices have also expressed concern that this year's version of the amendment, as opposed to previous versions, allows Congress, but not the States, to pass legislation implementing the amendment. They appropriately note that the States can better determine what laws are needed to implement the amendment, as it is the operation of their own criminal justice system that is really at issue. But that would again lead to precisely the patchwork of laws and protections varying from State to State that the sponsors of this amendment wish to avoid and claim is the reason they need a constitutional amendment. 
   I cannot emphasize enough that I am deeply committed to protecting the victims of crime. As a State senator in the Wisconsin State Senate in 1991, I voted in favor of amending the Wisconsin State Constitution to include protections for victims. As I have noted, most States have a State constitutional protection for victims, and every State in the country has at least a statute to protect victims. 
   I draw my colleagues' attention to the example of Wisconsin because the Wisconsin State Constitution repeatedly clarifies that the rights granted to the victim in the Wisconsin Constitution are not intended to diminish the rights of the accused. The Wisconsin amendment contains language that explicitly forbids victims' rights from impairing the rights of the accused that are otherwise guaranteed by law. Unfortunately, the victims' rights amendment before this body does not contain a similar provision. 
   For that reason, I offered an amendment during the Judiciary Committee markup that would have included a clarification similar to the Wisconsin language. It is troubling and puzzling to me that the majority of the Judiciary Committee did not agree with that amendment because they stated over and over again in defense of this amendment that it would in no way derogate the rights of the defense. If that is so, why did they oppose such a simple clarification that we found so useful when passing a similar provision in Wisconsin? 
   When, in the wake of the Boston massacre, John Adams defended the British soldiers accused of committing the killings there, he said:  
   [I]t [is] more beneficial that many guilty persons should go unpunished than one innocent person should suffer.  
   Surely, if there is a central pillar of the American system of justice, this is it: Above all, we must protect the rights of the innocent. 
   That is why our Constitution enshrines limitations on the State and protections of the individual whose liberties the State would seek to curtail. 
   Sadly, even with our manifold protections for the rights of the accused, history has demonstrated that time and again America has on occasion brought innocence itself to the bar and condemned it to jail or even to die. 
   Many proponents of the amendment before the Senate today state categorically that the rights of victims and the rights of the accused can comfortably coexist. They claim the amendment would not reduce the rights of the accused. They may be right, although I fear that cases may arise where judges will believe that to give the amendment force will require a lessening of protections for the accused. Be that as it may, the proponents of this amendment have refused to make this protection of the rights of the accused crystal clear by writing that intent into the amendment itself. Until they do, it is not unreasonable for Senators to fear that this constitutional amendment in some cases would actually end up curtailing the legitimate rights and liberties of defendants in courts of law. 
   For those who believe in individual freedom and civil liberties, this should be troubling, indeed. 
   The Constitution should be modified sparingly, where no other alternative provides an adequate solution. That showing has not been made. The laws on the books now should be fully enforced. Courts and prosecutors should be given the resources they need to protect victims under current law. Congress and State legislatures should enact additional legislation where needed to give additional protection. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting prudent, statutory safeguards for victims. But I urge my colleagues to vote against this victims' rights amendment to the Constitution.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to rename the United States Post Office in my home town of Janesville, Wisconsin in honor of Les Aspin. I am joined by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL. This bill is a companion to legislation introduced in the House by Congressman PAUL RYAN, who represents the First District of Wisconsin, which includes Janesville. 
   This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of Les' first campaign for the First Congressional District seat in Wisconsin. I was a junior at Janesville Craig High School at the time, and I signed up as a volunteer on Les' campaign. He won that election after a tough recount in the primary, defeating the incumbent Congressman. 
   Following the campaign, I interned in his district office in Janesville during the summers of 1971 and in 1972. I am proud to say that during the next 25 years, Les and I had a continuing friendship, as he carved out a distinguished career in the United States House of Representatives, eventually rising to become the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, while I prepared for and began my own career. 
   Les Aspin served his country ably in many capacities. As an Army captain, he worked as an analyst in the Pentagon; he served on the staff of President John F. Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors; he represented Wisconsinites for 22 years in Congress; he enthusiastically took on the giant task of steering the Defense Department into the uncharted waters of the post-Cold War era. Mr. Aspin served as Secretary of Defense under President Clinton and, at the time of his death in 1995, he was the chair of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, working on needed reforms in our intelligence communities. 
   Mr. President, Les Aspin was a man I deeply respected and admired, and I felt a profound sense of loss at his passing. Renaming the Janesville post office in his honor is a fitting way to remember a man who spent his life serving the people of Wisconsin and of the  United States. I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to authorize payment of rewards to individuals furnishing information relating to persons subject to indictment for serious violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda. This bill would add the masterminds of the Rwandan genocide to the list of individuals our rewards program is helping to track down, and this legislation will send those individuals a clear message--that there is no impunity for genocide, that the world will not forget, and that they cannot evade justice forever.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was pleased to join Senators LEAHY and KENNEDY as a sponsor of the Crime Victims Assistance Act, and I endorse this modified version of the bill. This is an important bill designed to give substantial, enforceable rights to the victims of federal crimes to participate fully in the various criminal justice proceedings arising out of their cases. 
   I understand that the sponsors of the constitutional amendment concerning the rights of victims of crime, often referred to as the Victims' Rights Amendment or VRA, will bring the amendment to the Senate floor in the near future. I have the utmost concern for the victims of crime, and I want to see them supported as much as possible in the law as they deal with the consequences of the crime committed against them. But I oppose the amendment. 
   The main reason for my opposition is that I do not think it is necessary to amend our great governing document, the Constitution of the United States, to provide the protection that victims of crime seek and deserve. We have a responsibility to deal with these issues through legislation before turning to the constitutional amendment process. That process is long and uncertain and its results are much less easier to fix than a statute if we have left something undone that should have been done. 
   The statutory alternative developed by Senators LEAHY and KENNEDY, which I expect will be offered as an amendment to the VRA when it comes to the floor, will truly serve the interests of victims in a much more direct and effective way than would a constitutional amendment. And we can enact it this year, getting relief and protections to victims of crime immediately that will not be available to them until some uncertain date under the constitutional amendment. 
   So I am pleased to join in this effort, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to try to convince the Senate that this is the best way to support the interests of victims of violent crime.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one thing observers of the Senate are not likely to see today is anyone defending the marriage penalty. The tax code should not discourage the act of getting married, and it should not encourage divorce. 
   There is widespread agreement that Congress should pass marriage penalty relief. The President's budget included a proposal to address the marriage penalty. And last week, the Senate voted 99-1 in favor of sense of the Senate language calling on us to ``pass marriage penalty tax relief legislation that begins a phase down of this penalty in 2001.'' 
   The marriage penalty is particularly burdensome for lower-income couples--and many young couples don't have much to spare. For some of these couples, the amount of their taxes could actually affect their decision whether or not to marry. Luckily, in the vast majority of cases, in the words of a recent law review article, love triumphs over money. 
   But in this debate that the majority has scheduled for the week before the April 15 tax deadline, one can be forgiven for harboring the suspicion that more than marriage penalty relief is involved. 
   For one thing, on this subject on which there is a broad consensus, the majority appears unwilling to work out a compromise with the President or with Democrats. Rather, the majority seems driven more to create election-year campaign talking points than real tax relief. 
   For another thing, on this bill, for the third time this year already, the majority seems willing to plow ahead on major tax cut legislation before even adopting its own fiscal plan in the form of a budget resolution. To recount, in early February, the Senate passed a $103 billion tax cut as part of the bankruptcy bill. Then, in early March, the Senate passed another $21 billion tax cut for education savings accounts. And now in April, the Senate is considering another $248 billion in tax cuts labeled as marriage penalty relief. So the majority this year has already moved $372 billion in tax cuts--at an average rate of $124 billion a month--before it has even adopted its budget resolution. 
   And you need to add to that the approximately $80 billion in debt services that tax cuts of such a size would require. That yields roughly $450 billion of the surplus that this Senate will have spent in just three months--an average of $150 billion a month. And that doesn't even count the health tax cut provisions that we can expect in the Patients Bill of Rights bill. And that also doesn't count the other multi-billion-dollar reconciliation tax cut that the budget resolution calls for no later than September 22. 
   Some said that the majority brought up the amendment to the Constitution to prevent flag burning when they did because the American Legion was having a convention that week. Now, it seems that they are bringing up the marriage penalty because tax day is coming. What the majority chooses to call up seem more driven by the calendar than by legislative sense. 
   Moving so many tax bills so early in the year raises another suspicion as well--that if we waited, we would find that there is not enough money to do everything that the majority wants. 
   The Senate's consideration of a tax cut this size is also premature because the majority continues to push tax cuts before doing anything to extend the life of Social Security, before doing anything to extend the life of Medicare, or before doing anything to make prescription drugs available to seniors who need them. 
   Yes, Social Security is projected to run cash surpluses on the order of $100 billion a year for the next decade, but beginning in 2015, it is projected to pay out more in benefits than it takes in in payroll taxes. Medicare Hospital Insurance benefit payments will exceed payroll tax revenues as early as 2007. 
   The tax cuts that the Senate has passed and that we debate today would phase in so that their full impact would come just as the Nation begins to need surpluses in the non-Social Security budget to help address these Social Security and Medicare commitments. 
   In 2010, the marriage penalty bill before us today alone will cost $40 billion a year. Rather than pay down our debt to free up resources for our coming needs, these tax cuts would add to our future obligations. To commit resources of this magnitude without addressing the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare is simply irresponsible. 
   The size of the tax cut before us today flows in large part from its scatter-shot approach. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, it delivers a comparable amount of benefits to those who enjoy marriage bonuses as to those who suffer from marriage penalties. And according to Citizens for Tax Justice, more than two-thirds of this tax bill's benefits would go to the fewer than one-third of couples with incomes of more than $75,000. Are tax cuts for the well-off really our most pressing national need? A more targeted approach could save money and leave us better prepared to address our coming fiscal commitments. 
   Our economy is strong and has benefitted from sound fiscal policy. Monday's papers reported that unemployment has remained below 4 1/2 percent for fully two years now. The Nation continues to enjoy the longest economic expansion in its history. And home ownership is at its highest rate on record. 
   We have this strong economy in no small part because of the responsible fiscal policy we have had since 1993. That responsible policy has meant that the government has borrowed less from the public than it otherwise would have, and indeed is projected to have paid down nearly $300 billion in publicly-held debt by October. No longer does the government crowd out private borrowers from the credit market. No longer does the government bid up the price of borrowing--interest rates--to finance its huge debt. Our fiscal policy has thus allowed interest rates to remain lower than they otherwise would be, and businesses large and small have found it easier to invest and spur new growth. 
   Passing large tax cuts like the one before us today without addressing the long-run needs of Social Security and Medicare risks returning to the budgets of 1992, when the government ran a unified budget deficit of $290 billion and a non-Social Security deficit of $340 billion. It risks returning to the Congressional Budget Office's 1993 projection of a unified budget deficit that would climb to $513 billion in 2001, instead of the unified budget surplus of $181 billion and non-Social Security surplus of $15 billion that we now enjoy. 
   Any young couple would be well-advised to do a little financial planning before entering into a marriage. We can ask the Senate to do no less. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator KENNEDY's amendment which would raise the individual maximum Pell grant Award to $3,700, an increase of $400. 
   Higher education is one of the most important investments our Federal government can make. After all, for the United States to continue its economic growth, we need an educated workforce. 
   I recognize that the federal government cannot guarantee that all Americans will be able to attend a post secondary institution. But we must ensure that all qualified Americans have equal access to a post secondary education. 
   After all, Congress created need-based student financial aid programs to ensure that individuals from low-income families are not denied post secondary education because they cannot afford it. 
   Grant aid, specifically Pell grant aid, is the key that enables many individuals to graduate from college. 
   I am deeply concerned about the emergence of a widening educational gap between rich and poor. Statistic after statistic illustrates that students from low-income families are pursuing a post-secondary education at a much slower rate than individuals from middle and upper income families. 
   With more and more students attending college, the situation may get much worse unless Congress fully funds Pell. Over the next ten years, more than 14 million undergraduates will be enrolled in colleges and universities around the country--an increase of 11 percent. 
   Many of these students will be the first in their families to attend college and one in five of these students will come from families with incomes below the poverty level. The same students that rely on need-based student grant aid.  
   Without Pell grants, many individuals simply can't consider college--and without a college degree or serious post-secondary training, some employers won't consider hiring these individuals. 
   Statistic after statistic shows that a college education helps those who graduate from college with a bachelor's degree earn 74 percent more than those who only complete high school. 
   What is so tragic is the decrease in Pell grant funding. The Pell grant has failed to keep up with inflation. Over the past 25 years, the value of the average Pell grant has decreased by 23 percent--the average grant is now worth only 77 percent of what Pell grants were worth in 1975. 
   What is even more troubling about the trend of increasing tuition and decreasing impact of grant value is how students, especially low-income students, make up the difference between aid and tuition. 
   This chart illustrates grant and loan funding as a percentage of total aid. 
   As you can see, twenty years ago, grant aid comprised approximately fifty-two percent of a student's aid package, and loans comprised about forty-two percent. 
   Over the past 20 years, this trend has reversed itself--loans now constitute almost 60 percent of total aid, and grants have plummeted to about forty percent. 
   Unfortunately, some aren't aware of the recent funding trends for the Pell Grant or its importance. Let's take a look at a recent headline of the Eau-Claire Leader-Telegram:  
   Bush Averse to more college grant funding. Let students get loans, candidate says in Eau Claire.  
   Apparently, Governor Bush isn't aware that most students are already having to fund their education through loans and more and more debt. Well, Mr. President, as I visit college campuses each year in Wisconsin, I hear from students who are forced to turn to credit cards to pay the difference on tuition, for books or groceries. 
   In fact, last year alone, the number of students who took out non-federal loans increased by 25 percent. 
   Well, it seems that Governor Bush believes that Congress needs to force students to take on even more debt. Again, Governor Bush's views on how students should pay for a post secondary education:  
   Some of it you are going to have to pay back, and that's just the way it is because there is nothing free in society. College is not free.  
   What, then, is need-based grant aid? Congress created need-based grant aid to ensure that individuals from low and middle income families are not denied post secondary education because they cannot afford it. 
   Congress created the student grant aid programs under the Higher Education Act for the specific purpose of making college affordable for those in need. 
   Even after someone pointed out that some students already carry a heavy loan repayment burden, Governor Bush didn't get the picture. According to the Leader-Telegram, Bush responded to this statement by saying ``too bad.'' 
   Congress should not say ``too bad'' to students who are in need. I believe that everyone deserves fair and equal access to a higher education. 
   After all, that is why Congress created need based grant aid. 
   By supporting this amendment and an increase for the Pell grant program, Congress has a chance to renew its commitment to equal access for all to higher education. I thank my colleagues for their time and support.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. JEFFORDS, to strike a small part of the overly large tax cut included in this budget resolution and instead use that money for grants to the states under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA. 
   For too long the federal government has failed to live up to its responsibility to provide to the States the up to 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for each disabled child served allowed by IDEA. 
   During the current fiscal year, the federal government will fund only about 12.6 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure. This is 37.4 percent less than the maximum amount allowed under IDEA--an amount that the federal government has not once provided to the states since this funding formula was created. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress is appropriating only about a third of what would be required to fully fund IDEA. 
   As I travel around my home state of Wisconsin every year to host listening sessions in each of our 72 counties, I hear time and time again from frustrated parents, school administrators, teachers, school board members, and others about the need for an increase in special education funding at the federal level. 
   Just last week at my Dane County listening session, one of my constituents told me that full funding of the maximum federal share of IDEA would have meant an additional $17 million for his school district during the 1999-2000 school year. And there are stories like that across my state and around the country. 
   In Wisconsin, and in many other states, the population of students eligible for special education is outpacing the modest annual increases in the Federal share of special education funding, and state and local governments are struggling to keep up. 
   Mr. President, the efforts of our pubic schools to serve students with disabilities are a hallmark of our national commitment to a free appropriate public education for all children. Since 1975, public schools have helped students with disabilities become more self-sufficient, to prepare for employment, and to learn the skills they will need to lead productive lives. America's public schools have led the way toward the full integration of individuals with disabilities in our national life. Our society is richer for it. 
   IDEA has provided access to free, appropriate public education for millions of previously unserved or underserved students. Through assessments, evaluations, and Individual Education Program (IEPs), every disabled student is  served based on his or her individual educational needs in the setting where those needs can best be met. 
   We must do more to help state and local governments pay for the cost of educating these children. 
   I urge my colleagues to support his common sense amendment. It will move toward fully funding the federal share of IDEA, and it will help to provide badly needed relief for a deserving group of Americans.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret I will be unable to support the amendment offered by Senator ALLARD to provide for budget procedures designed to reduce our national debt. While I strongly agree with the goal of debt reduction, I cannot support the amendment because of several important flaws. 
   First, the amendment calls for at least partially privatizing Social Security as part of an overall reform plan for that program. While I believe we need to pursue modest reforms to Social Security, I strongly oppose efforts to privatize that program. For the past seven decades, Social Security has worked to keep retirees out of poverty. Roughly half of seniors would in live poverty were it not for Social Security. It would be a great mistake to eliminate the fundamental shared security that program provides by moving to a privatized system. 
   Second, while a policy of planned debt reduction may be meritorious, there are clearly times when it would be wise to temporarily suspend such plans. The amendment provides for one exception, namely a declaration of war. However, there are other circumstances under which an exception may be needed, in particular, when there is a severe economic recession. At such a time, debt reduction may aggravate an economic slump. At the very least, the amendment should provide some flexibility with respect to the level of debt reduction. Unfortunately, it does not. 
   Finally, the amendment may be unconstitutional, as it attempts to constrain the power of the Vice President, provided in the Constitution, to break tie votes in the Senate. It is ironic that perhaps the most critical vote of the past decade in the cause of a lower national debt, the vote to pass the 1993 deficit reduction package, was decided by the tie-breaking vote of the Vice President and would have been precluded had this provision been in effect at the time. That single vote may be more responsible for the record-breaking economic growth we have experienced than any other over the past seven years. More importantly, this provision is almost certainly unconstitutional, and on that basis alone, warrants opposition. 
   This budget resolution would certainly look a lot better were it to incorporate the levels of debt reduction contemplated by this amendment, and it is regretful that, thanks in large part to the fiscally irresponsible tax cuts in it, the underlying budget resolution could not sustain the level of debt reduction that Senator ALLARD proposes. While I cannot vote for his amendment, I congratulate Senator ALLARD on his effort, for he has certainly helped to raise the critical issue of debt reduction, and given it the priority it deserves.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the budget resolution assumes revenues from leasing the lands in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling. 
   I, too, support the efforts of the senior Senator from Delaware to ensure that drilling in the Arctic Refuge is not used as a revenue assumption. I have also long been a cosponsor of his bill to designate the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge as a wilderness area. 
   Not only do I support this amendment along with many Members of this body, but also I support this amendment along with Members of the other body who have worked so hard on this issue. I particularly recognize the efforts of my colleague in the other body, Mr. VENTO, who so long and so well has led the fight to designate the refuge as wilderness. 
   I am concerned this assumption obligates Congress to decide whether or not to drill on the Coastal Plain refuge before we decide whether or not it should be designated as wilderness. Drilling on the Coastal Plain allows an activity that is generally considered to be incompatible with designated wilderness areas. 
   In addition, I am concerned about the potential impact drilling would have upon the existing wilderness, the area that was just being discussed, existing wilderness in the Arctic Refuge. Eight million acres south of the Coastal Plain are already designated as wilderness. I want my colleagues to be aware the drilling question does not only impact our ability to make future wilderness designations in the refuge but also may impact areas that we have already protected in the public trust. 
   I suggest even if the previous portrayal by the Senator from California was of an area that is already protected, that is part of the point. Drilling in this area could have an impact on the already-protected area. I want to speak to my colleagues who may be considering allowing drilling in the refuge in light of current high oil prices. Supporters of drilling argue that the Arctic Refuge has the potential of yielding 16 billion barrels of oil. That figure, I am afraid, represents the outside limit of probabilities for an assessment area that includes the Arctic Refuge, Coastal Plain, plus adjacent areas where exploration has already taken place. 
   When you look at just the Coastal Plain, the correct low-probability estimate of oil is 11.8 billion barrels of undiscovered oil; 25 percent less than the 16-billion-barrel figure. Moreover,  USGS assigns a probability of 5 percent, or 1 chance in 20, to the possibility that a field of that magnitude will be discovered. The mean estimate for technically recoverable oil is considerably lower, and the figure for oil that is economically recoverable is lower still. In fact, USGS concluded that the refuge is capable of producing, altogether, approximately 3.2 billion barrels of oil. That is only one-fifth the amount of oil we have heard might be available. 
   If including this assumption in the budget resolution may impair our ability to make a decision about the wilderness qualities of the refuge in the future, and if the refuge does not contain as much oil as we thought, why are we considering drilling? Consider this: Oil companies with an interest in drilling in the refuge poured millions of dollars of soft money into the coffers of the political parties in 1999; millions of dollars in just 1 year, and it was an off-year election at that. I would like to briefly call the bankroll on just a few of the oil companies that would profit from opening the refuge to drilling so my colleagues and the public can have a fuller picture of what is at stake. 
   Last year, giant political donor Atlantic Richfield, its executives and subsidiaries, gave more than $880,000 in soft money to the parties. The recently merged Exxon-Mobil, its executives and subsidiaries, gave more than $340,000 in soft money in 1999. And in 1999, BP Amoco, the result of another oil megamerger, gave over $361,000 in soft money, along with its executives and subsidiaries. 
   This is quite an influx of cash. In a day and age where wealthy interests drop $100,000 checks to the parties on a regular basis, the huge donations of the oil and gas industry are still remarkable. As we examine this issue closely, I think we have to keep the industry's donations and the resulting political clout in mind as we debate this legislation. 
   As I have said, the facts do not point toward drilling in the refuge. The refuge does not contain as much oil as we thought. What is more, including this in the budget resolution may cause problems down the road as we decide about the wilderness qualities of the refuge in the future. 
   For these reasons, I support the amendment proposed by the Senator from Delaware. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, America's economy is strong. The Nation is enjoying the longest economic expansion in its history, at 107 consecutive months and counting. Last Friday's papers reported that the fourth quarter of 1999 grew at a blistering 7.3 percent, the fastest quarterly rate since 1984. We have the lowest unemployment rate in three decades, and home ownership is at its highest rate--at 67 percent--on record. 
   As the old saying goes, ``[V]ictory finds a hundred fathers but defeat is an orphan.'' There is an economic corollary: The advocates of hundreds of policies claim to have fathered economic growth, but none admit to have spawned recession. 
   While certainly several causes contributed to the current economic expansion--among them technological innovation, free markets, and harder- and longer-working workers--there can be no denying that a key contributor to our booming economy has been the Government's fiscal responsibility since 1993. 
   In 1992, the Government ran a unified budget deficit of $290 billion and a non-Social Security deficit of $340 billion. When President Clinton took office in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office greeted him with a projection that the unified budget deficit would climb to $513 billion in 2001. Instead, CBO now projects that in fiscal year 2001, the Government will run a unified budget surplus of $181 billion and a non-Social Security surplus of $15 billion. 
   Our responsible fiscal policy means that the Government has borrowed less from the public than it otherwise would have, and indeed has paid down debt held by the public. No longer does the Government crowd out private borrowers from the credit market. No longer does the Government bid up the price of borrowing--interest rates--to finance its huge debt. Our fiscal policy has thus allowed interest rates to remain lower than they otherwise would be, and millions of Americans have realized savings on their mortgages, car loans, and student loans. In this favorable credit market, businesses large and small have found it easier to invest and spur yet more new growth. 
   But just as victory engenders multiple claims of fatherhood, a surplus seems to breed ready ways to spend it away, and the greatest single threat to that surplus, to responsible fiscal policy, and to the strong economy to which it has contributed is represented by the budget resolution before us today. This budget would 
   spend away all of the non-Social Security surplus in one fell swoop on a massive tax cut plan reminiscent of the early 1980s. The budget would launch this irresponsible tax enterprise before having taken any steps to save Social Security or to reform Medicare or to lock away on-budget surpluses to pay down the debt. 
   This budget does more than merely portray those tax cuts. This budget resolution would create a fast-track reconciliation vehicle to move that massive tax cut bill through the Congress. As my colleagues know, reconciliation comes with a 20-hour limit on debate, so that no one can debate it at length. Reconciliation bills can pass with a simple majority, so the majority does not have to reach consensus or compromise with others, as the rules of the Senate otherwise require. The reconciliation process prevents bringing up any tax cut that the majority of the Finance Committee does not bring up for us. In terms of real world consequences, the only value of this budget resolution is as a tax cut delivery device. 
   Sadly, as well, this budget continues the gimmickry of the last few years in connection with the annual appropriations process. We all have seen this pattern before. The budget resolution begins with an unrealistic appropriations level to pave the way for fiscally irresponsible tax cuts. The appropriators try to live within it by using one gimmick after another, and then, at the end of the year, the President and Congress negotiate a final spending package far above the levels originally provided for in the budget resolution. 
   I am sorry to say, we are well down that road again this year. This budget resolution advertises appropriations levels--at $596 billion--halfway between a freeze and what is needed to fund current services. 
   But the resolution actually gives the Appropriations Committees a much lower level than either of these with which to work. Read the fine print in section 209 of this resolution, in the numbers in function 920, and on page 2 of the committee report. As our ranking member on the Budget Committee, the distinguished Senator from New Jersey has already pointed out, there we find that this resolution actually gives the Appropriations Committee $541 billion, the cap levels for fiscal year 2001. That is $45 billion less than a freeze. What is this? 
   This is a recipe for gridlock, just like last year, and the year before. This budget resolution simply invites a giant, omnibus appropriations measure at the end of the year, instead of working our way carefully through the 13 regular appropriations measures. This budget resolution invites even more budget gimmickry than last year, in order for the appropriators to live within these unrealistic levels. And it does so simply to advance a tax cut that is too big and would stick our kids with the bill. 
   I would suggest, this is no way to govern. Rather than playing another year of budget chicken, Congress should work with the President to reach a consensus on fiscal policy. Rather than force a giant train wreck at the end of the year, Congress should work on a responsible budget at the beginning--right now. 
   Mr. President, regrettably, this budget resolution is yet another missed opportunity. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the people of Senegal on their recent democratic presidential elections. On March 19, the citizens of Senegal selected a new leader, Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party, in run-off elections for the presidency. This election was not just for show. The Senegalese people were not simply going through the motions of political participation. Rather this was a remarkable moment in Senegalese and African history. After 40 years of Socialist Party rule, the Senegalese people peacefully and democratically took control of their country's destiny and chose to make a change. 
   I also want to acknowledge the behavior of incumbent President Abdou Diouf, who has held power for two decades. President Diouf lost the vote, but he won the respect of champions of democracy worldwide when he accepted the choice of the voters and gracefully congratulated Mr. Wade on his victory. The manner in which he leaves office will be one of the richest elements of his legacy. 
   Mr. President, so often the only news that Americans hear from Africa is news of war and oppression, of flood and famine, of disease and drought. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on Africa, I have often come to this floor to speak about abuses and conflicts in the sub-Saharan region. But I have also spent enough time learning about Africa to know that small victories are won each day--in cities and villages across the continent, individuals, families, and communities are making real progress in their quest for a better future. This month the people of Senegal won a truly great victory, and it is my pleasure to call this Senate's attention to their achievement.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly thank the Senator from Utah. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment offered by the junior Senator from South Carolina, Senator HOLLINGS. 
   First I would like to say a few words about the Senator from South Carolina. Our colleague Senator HOLLINGS has been calling for meaningful campaign finance reform for perhaps longer than any other Member of the U.S. Senate. I disagree with this particular approach. But I certainly do not question his sincerity or commitment to reform. 
   Back in 1993, my first year in the Senate, Senator HOLLINGS offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to take up a constitutional amendment very similar to the one that is before us today. I remember we had a very short period of time before that vote came up, and I decided to vote with the Senator from South Carolina on that day. I did so because I believed that other than balancing the Federal budget, there was perhaps no more fundamental issue facing our country than the need to reform our election laws. 
   Such a serious topic I believed at the time merited at least a consideration of a constitutional amendment. And I will certainly confess to a certain level of frustration at that time with the fact that the Senate and other body had not yet acted to pass meaningful campaign finance reform in that Congress. 
   To be candid, I immediately realized, even as I was walking back to my office from this Chamber, that I had made a mistake. I started rethinking right away whether I really wanted the U.S. Senate to consider amending the first amendment, even to address the extremely important subject of campaign finance reform. 
   Then, 18 months later, my perspective on this question began to change even more as I was presented with two new development here in the Senate. 
   First I was given the privilege of serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and, second, I learned that the 104th Congress, newly under the control of what remains the majority party, was to become the engine for a trainload of proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I had a very good seat to witness first hand the surgery that some wanted to perform on the basic governing document of our country, the Constitution. 
   It started with a proposal right away for a balanced budget constitutional amendment. Soon we were considering a term limits constitutional amendment, and then a flag desecration constitutional amendment, then a school prayer amendment, then a super majority tax increase amendment, and then a victims rights amendment. In all over 100 constitutional amendments were introduced in the 104th Congress. A similar number were introduced in the last Congress as well. And in this Congress already we have seen over 60 constitutional amendments introduced. 
   As I saw legislator after legislator suggest that every sort of social, economic, and political problem we have in this country could be solved merely with enactment of a constitutional amendment, I chose to oppose strongly not only this constitutional amendment but others that also sought to undermine our most treasured founding principle. I firmly believe we must curb this reflexive practice of attempting to cure each and every political and social ill of our Nation by tampering with the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution of this country was not a rough draft. We must stop treating it as such. 
   We must also understand that even if we were to adopt this constitutional amendment, and the states were to ratify it, which we all know is not going to happen, it will not take us one single, solitary step closer to campaign finance reform. It is not a silver bullet. This constitutional amendment empowers the Congress to set mandatory spending limits on congressional candidates. Those are the kind of mandatory limits that were struck down in the landmark Buckley v. Valeo decision. 
   Here is the question I pose for supporters of this amendment: If this constitutional amendment were to pass the Congress and be ratified by the States, would campaign finance reformers have the necessary 51 votes--or more likely the necessary 60 votes--to pass legislation that includes mandatory spending limits? I don't think so. 
   We do not even have 60 votes to pass a ban on soft money at this point. And we probably don't even have a bare majority of the Senate who support spending limits, much less mandatory spending limits. 
   I have been working for many years with the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, on a bipartisan campaign finance proposal. While our proposal has changed over the years, we have consistently been guided by a desire to work within the guidelines established by the Supreme Court. Although our opponents disagree, we are confident that the McCain-Feingold bill is constitutional and will be upheld by the courts. 
   I am mystified by the comments of the Senator from South Carolina who stated pointblank: Everyone knows the McCain-Feingold bill is unconstitutional. In fact, the recent Missouri Shrink case said by a 6-3 margin such limitations on contributions are constitutional. It was a supermajority of the Supreme Court. It is not credible, I believe, for anyone to argue at this point that a ban on soft money is unconstitutional. 
   Our original proposal, unlike the law that was considered in Buckley v. Valeo, included voluntary spending limits. We offered incentives in the form of free and discounted television time to encourage but not require candidates to limit their campaign spending. That kind of reform is patterned on the Presidential public funding system that was specifically upheld in Buckley.  
   Later versions of our bill have focused on abolishing soft money, the unlimited contributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals to political parties. Very few constitutional scholars, other than a current nominee to the FEC, Brad Smith, believe that the Constitution prevents us from banning soft money. As I indicated, the Missouri Shrink case makes that clear. 
   The key point is this: We don't need to amend the Constitution to do what needs to be done. Of course, when we bring a campaign finance bill to the floor we are met with strong resistance. In fact, so far we have been stopped by a filibuster. The notion that this constitutional amendment will somehow magically pave the way for legislation that includes mandatory spending limits simply ignores the reality of the opposition that campaign finance reformers face in the Senate, and I think we face in the Senate even after a ratification of the Hollings amendment. 
   This amendment, if ratified, would remove the obstacle of the Supreme Court from mandatory spending limit legislation, but it will not remove the obstacle of those Senators such as the Senator from Kentucky, who believe we need more money, not less, in our political system. 
   Most disconcerting to me is what this proposed constitutional amendment would mean to the first amendment. I find nothing more sacred and treasured in our Nation's history than the first amendment. It is perhaps the one tenet of our Constitution that sets our country apart from every type of government formed and tested by mankind throughout history. No other country has a provision quite like our first amendment. 
   The first amendment is the bedrock of the Bill of Rights. It has as its underpinning the notion that every citizen has a fundamental right to disagree with his or her government. 
   It says that a newspaper has an unfettered right to publish expressions of political or moral thought. It says that the Government may not establish a State-based religion that would infringe on the rights of those individuals who seek to be freed from such a religious environment. 
   I have stood on the floor of the Senate to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to prohibit the desecration of the U.S. flag, and I do so again this week. I do so because that amendment, for the first time in our history, would take a chisel to the first amendment. It would say that individuals have a constitutional right to express themselves--unless they are expressing themselves by burning a flag. 
   Just as I deplore as much as anyone in this body any individual who would take a match to the flag of the United States, I am firmly convinced that unrestrained spending on congressional campaigns has eroded the confidence of the American people in their government and their leaders. I believe we should speak out against those who desecrate the flag. I believe we should take immediate steps to fundamentally overhaul our system of financing campaigns. But I do not believe, as the supporters of this constitutional amendment and other amendments believe, that we need to amend the U.S. Constitution to accomplish our goals. 
   Nothing in this constitutional amendment before the Senate today would prevent what we witnessed in the last election. Allegations of illegality and improprieties, accusations of abuse, and the selling of access to high-ranking Government officials would continue no matter what the outcome of the vote on this constitutional amendment. Only the enactment of legislation that bans soft money contributions will make a meaningful difference. 
   I see Members of the Senate as having three choices. First, they can vote for constitutional amendments and one-sided reform proposals that basically have predetermined fates of never becoming law. That allows you to say you voted for something and put the matter aside. Second, they can stand with the Senator from Kentucky and others who tell us ``all is well'' with our campaign finance system and we should not be disturbed that so much money is pouring into the campaign coffers of candidates and parties. 
   A third option is that Senators can join with the Senator from Arizona and myself and others who have tried to approach this problem from a bipartisan perspective and have tried to craft a reform proposal that is fair to all, and constitutional. 
   Without meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform, the American people will continue to perceive their elected leaders as being for sale. They will continue to distrust and doubt the integrity of their own Government. And they will have good reason for that distrust and doubt. This system of legalized bribery threatens the very foundations of our democracy. 
   Senator MCCAIN and I intend to make sure that the Senate will have another opportunity to address this issue. We have had many debates on campaign finance reform, and we will have many more until we pass it. I understand and share the frustration of those who support reform and are tired of seeing our efforts fail. I want to finish this job too. But the way to address the campaign finance problem is to pass constitutional legislation, not a constitutional amendment. We must redouble our efforts to break the deadlock and give the people real reform this year, not 7 or more years from now. 
   I urge the Members of the Senate to reject this amendment. It is not necessary to tinker with the first amendment in order to accomplish campaign finance reform. I greatly admire the sincerity and commitment of the Senator from South Carolina, but I do not think his amendment will bring us any closer to passing campaign finance reform. 
   I thank the Senator from Utah, again, for his courtesy in allowing me to address this issue. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we in the Senate speak today to honor the American flag, the symbol of our Nation. Both those who favor and those who oppose the amendment to the Constitution now pending do so. We all, of course, seek to honor the flag.  
   I dare say that there is not a Senator among us who does not feel goose bumps when first looking up at the dome of the Capitol and seeing our flag. I would wager that no U.S. Senator fails to get a lump in the throat when standing to the strains of the national anthem. And I am confident that there is none among us whose eyes do not sometimes mist over when watching those seven bars of red and six of white ripple in the breeze and tug at the heart. 
   But, my colleagues, honoring the flag demands that we here fully and fairly debate this amendment. Amending the Constitution is an undertaking of the greatest import. For the Congress to propose an amendment to the Constitution of the United States on the basis of anything less than a full--even an exhaustive--debate would show less than the full respect due to the flag and the Constitution that it represents. 
   Honor demands that we view any effort to amend the Constitution with trepidation. Since the adoption of the Bill of Rights in 1791, America has amended its Constitution on only 17 occasions. Our Constitution has served this Nation well and withstood the test of time, in large part because Congress has resisted the urge to respond to every adversity, real or imagined, with a constitutional amendment. We should exercise restraint in amending this great charter. 
   We honor the American flag because we love ``the Republic for which it stands.'' We honor the banner because we cherish ``one Nation ..... with liberty and justice for all.'' We honor the flag because it represents a Constitution, that solemn commitment; and a Bill of Rights, that charter of liberty; unrivaled in the history of humankind. 
   Honor demands that we seek to protect not just the flag, but the principles in that Constitution and that Bill of Rights--principles of freedom, opportunity, and liberty. I believe these principles, as much as our Nation's cherished symbols, frame our history and define our Nation. As dearly as we hold the flag, we must hold these principles at least as dearly. 
   Yes, there have been some handfuls of sociopaths who burn our flag to thrust a firebrand in our eye. The question before us today is: Will the misguided actions of these few misfits cause us to curtail our fundamental principles of freedom? 
   We would only grant them victory if we allow their despicable acts to goad us into desecrating the greatest protection of individual rights in human history--our Bill of Rights. As Senator BOB KERREY has said:  
   Patriotism calls upon us to be brave enough to endure and withstand such an act--to tolerate the intolerable.  
   Let us show our strength, by not rising to the bait. Let us show our bravery, by not giving the flag burners what they want. Let us show our faith in the strength of this country and its institutions, by not lashing out in anger at those who would defile our flag. 
   The costs of this amendment would exact a far too great a price to pay. This amendment, if adopted, would criminalize the very acts that the Supreme Court has held to be protected by the first amendment. This amendment would clearly and intentionally erode the Bill of Rights. 
   This amendment would have an unprecedented, direct, and adverse effect on the freedoms embodies in the Bill of Rights. For the first time in our history, this amendment would employ the Constitution and the Bill of Rights--both premised on the idea of limiting the Government--to limit individual rights, and, in particular, the freedom of speech. 
   Our former colleague, Senator John Glenn, said it very well last year. He said:  
   Our revered symbol stands for freedom, but is not freedom itself. We must not let those who revile our way of life trick us into diminishing our great gift or even take a chance of diminishing our freedoms.  
   I am very proud to attempt to carry on John Glenn's fight against this ill-advised amendment. The Bill of Rights is too fundamental to our history, too important to our people, and too necessary to our future, for us to do anything else. 
   Honoring the flag demands that we also question the vagueness of the language of the amendment. Our Constitution Subcommittee heard testimony that the term ``flag of the United States,'' as used in this amendment, is ``problematic'' and so ``riddled with ambiguity'' as to ``war with the due process norm that the law should warn before it strikes.'' Even supporters of the amendment, including former Attorney General William Barr, have acknowledged that the term ``flag'' could mean any of a number of different things. No one can assure us as to what the term ``flag'' will mean other than to suggest it will be up to the governments of particular jurisdictions. 
   How would the amendment affect flags on T-shirts? How would the amendment affect flags on scarfs? In the memorable example given by the late and revered Senator John Chafee last year, How would the amendment affect a handmade flag rug? 
   Now the amendment, of course, does not make anything illegal by itself. It simply gives the Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag. But the question is still a powerful one. We must still ask: What kind of statute would this amendment insulate from constitutional attack? 
   Would this amendment permit Congress to enact a statute that would criminalize wearing a T-shirt with a flag on it? Or could Congress criminalize tearing such a T-shirt? 
   Would the amendment permit Congress to criminalize wearing a scarf with a flag on it? Or could Congress criminalize spitting on such a scarf? 
   Would this amendment permit Congress to criminalize making a rug with a flag on it? Or could Congress criminalize stepping on such a rug? 
   More generally, would the amendment allow Congress to enact statutes that permit the prosecution of people based on the views they express when they defile the flag? Consider two cases: In case one, a person smears blood on a flag while screaming protest of U.S. involvement in a foreign war. In case two, another person drips blood on a flag after suffering an injury at a summertime football game. After adoption of this amendment, would it be constitutional to prosecute the one who spoke and not prosecute the other, who did the same thing without speaking? 
   Here's another example. My colleagues may remember the very exciting victory of the U.S. Women's Soccer team in the Women's World Cup last year. A thrilling moment for sure, and tens of thousands of very patriotic Americans cheered the heroic deeds of the women who represented our country. 
   That evening, another soccer game was played here in Washington, DC, involving this city's major league soccer team, D.C. United. Many of the same fans who cheered the U.S. women that afternoon turned out to watch the D.C. United soccer team. Some of those fans, seeking to play for the TV cameras and their fellow fans brought a prop, which they unfurled during the game. Here is a picture of it. As you can see, it is an actual flag. It is not a representation or a picture. It is an actual flag of the United States with the words ``Thanks Girls!'' written on it with some type of chalk or marker. 
   Obviously the people who defaced this flag intended no disrespect to the United States or the flag. They were excited soccer fans, and probably very patriotic Americans. I wonder if the sponsors of this amendment can be sure of the answer to this question: Would the statute that Congress passes to prohibit flag desecration after this constitutional amendment is ratified allow for these people to be prosecuted? I think it is a fair question. 
   I think most of us would hope not. But how would the police or the prosecutors make that decision? If they look at the message and the beliefs of the people who have written on the flag, isn't that exactly the kind of content discrimination that the first amendment is designed to prohibit? Do we really want the government examining the motives of those who deface the flag to see if they are patriotic or well meaning enough to avoid discrimination? 
   I don't think so. I think that is what the first amendment is all about: to protect against Government inquiry into a citizen's political beliefs. On the other hand, if we have a completely content-neutral statute and enforcement that does not look at the motives of those who deface the flag, we might  end up prosecuting the excited and patriotic soccer fans shown in this poster. Obviously, I don't think we want that either. 
   So this example really shows the difficulties with outlawing desecration of the flag. People in this country use the flag to express joy and patriotism as well as opposition to the Government. And the traditions of our country, our respect for free political expression, demands that we not criminalize conduct that we would otherwise accept if it were motivated by patriotism instead of political dissent. 
   Some people call these kinds of examples ``wacky hypotheticals.'' But we do not have reliable answers to these questions. And when you are talking about amending the Constitution, you have a duty to consider and address hypotheticals. After all, it is not easy to correct a mistaken Constitution. We cannot just, by unanimous consent, pass a technical corrections bill to fix an unintended consequence of a constitutional amendment. 
   Let me share another case that I witnessed not far from this Senate Chamber. I was eating dinner at the restaurant called ``America'' over in Union Station. We noticed that the menu is colored like a giant American flag. We talked about having to be careful not to spill anything on it and how damaging our menu might be a crime under this amendment. Then we forgot about it and returned to our meal. But just a half hour later, there was a big commotion in the corner of the restaurant, and we turned to see a woman frantically trying to put out a fire that had started when her oversized American flag menu had gotten too close to the small candles on the table. 
   Now I hope that that woman was not engaged in an angry argument over the Government. But I suppose that is something that the police might have to investigate if this amendment and a statute that it authorized became law. Don't the police have more important things to investigate than whether the burning of a menu might violate the Constitution? 
   Some have been misled into believing that one can pull a flag off a building, burn it, and be protected by the Constitution. That is simply not true. There are many laws in effect today that prohibit theft, the destruction of federal property, or disturbing the peace. These can and should be used to address the majority of flag burning incidents. 
   Honoring the flag demands that we listen, as many on both sides of this debate have, to the true American war heroes who have testified to us on this issue. It was particularly inspiring to welcome John Glenn back to the Senate last year. The perspectives of the witnesses before the Judiciary Committee last year were of particular interest to me because they represented the diversity of views on this amendment by the American people, by veterans, and by war heroes. Those who fought and sacrificed for our country and its flag deserve our utmost respect when it comes to this flag amendment. They know well the costs of freedom and democracy, as well as the joys. Some would portray the views of veterans as monolithic, but, as our hearings showed quite plainly: They are not. 
   Those many veterans who oppose this amendment do so with conviction and power and strength. They know that no one can question their patriotism or love of country. Listen to the words of Professor Gary May of the University of Southern Indiana, who lost both his legs in the Vietnam war, and who testified before the Judiciary Committee last year. Professor May said:  
   Freedom is what makes the United States of America strong and great, and freedom, including the right to dissent, is what has kept our democracy going for more than 200 years. And it is freedom that will continue to keep it strong for my children and the children of all the people like my father, late father in law, grandfather, brother, me, and others like us who served honorably and proudly for freedom. 
   The pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per se. It's in the principles that it stands for and the people who have defended them. My pride and admiration is in our country, its people and its fundamental principles. I am grateful for the many heroes of our country--and especially those in my family. All the sacrifices of those who went before me would be for naught, if an amendment were added to the Constitution that cut back on our first amendment rights for the first time in the history of our great Nation.  
   The late Senator John Chafee, who as all will recall also served bravely at Guadalcanal and in the Korean war, last year said simply: ``[W]e cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, ..... taking steps to require citizens to respect the flag, sullies its significance and symbolism.'' Senator Chafee's words still bring a brisk, cool wind of caution. What kind of symbol of freedom and liberty will our flag be if it has to be protected from protesters by a constitutional amendment? 
   My friend and constituent Keith Kruel, a World War II veteran and past National Commander of the American Legion, addressed this point quite well in testimony he submitted for the Judiciary Committee last year. He said:  
   Freely displayed, our flag can be protected only by us, the people. Each citizen can gaze upon it, and it can mean what our heartfelt patriotic beliefs tell us individually. Government ``protection'' of a Nation's banner only invites scorn upon it. A patriot cannot be created by legislation. Patriotism must be nurtured in the family and educational process. It must come from the heartfelt emotion of true beliefs, credos and tenets.  
   Senator BOB KERREY, who is in the Chamber at this time, the only Congressional Medal of Honor winner to serve in the Senate in this century, spoke directly to the point when he said: ``Real patriotism cannot be coerced. It must be a voluntary, unselfish, brave act to sacrifice for others.'' I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, I want to say a couple of words. I join in the objection. I make no secret of the fact that I oppose each portion of the bill. It is very unbalanced, and there is far too much money behind the bill. I oppose the minimum wage portion because it involves 3 years rather than 2 years. I am especially concerned about the tax piece because it involves some $70 billion-plus that isn't paid for. 
   The reason I am objecting is because of the way this was put together. It got a high number of the majority by combining these different elements. In effect, the pot was sweetened by adding on the minimum wage and the tax provisions. I think it is inappropriate at this point to sort of bait and switch this. You close up the bill by putting these things together, and when they come back, you can't do anything about it under this procedure; it flies  through. All we are asking, as Senators KENNEDY and WELLSTONE have said, is that we have an opportunity to have the motions to instruct, and the minority leader's plan would provide that. That is the reason for my objection. I thank the Chair and the majority leader for the opportunity to comment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally going to act on the nomination of Marsha Berzon to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The history of her nomination is one of the most disappointing episodes in the Senate's recent shameful treatment of judicial nominees. One of America's most qualified appellate litigators has been held hostage by opponents who raise complaints without substance or merit to impede her confirmation. Today I hope to dispel some of the myths that opponents of her confirmation have used to block Marsha Berzon's nomination. I urge the Senate to confirm her, and put a highly qualified lawyer on the bench where she belongs. 
   What kind of nominee do we have before us today in the person of Marsha Berzon? We have a woman who has distinguished herself at all levels, from clerkship through successful private appellate practice. We have a woman who has already argued before the Supreme Court four times and has repeatedly appeared before Circuit courts around the country. 
   Thirty years ago Ms. Berzon received the honor of being picked as U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan's first female law clerk. Her opponents have seized on this honor as suggesting that Ms. Berzon possesses a liberal and activist judicial philosophy. I say to those who believe serving as a Supreme Court clerk is emblematic of one's political beliefs that they are wrong to believe a clerk adopts her Justice's philosophy for life. First, to be chosen by any Justice of the Supreme Court as a clerk is a rare and noteworthy honor, reserved for the most promising legal minds from the finest law schools. So the most important thing to be gathered from Ms. Berzon's service as a Supreme Court clerk is that her promise as a lawyer and future judge was already apparent thirty years ago just as she was beginning her career. 
   Second, it is demonstrably untrue that you can tell the philosophy of an individual by the belief of his or her former boss. I'm sure we all know examples of people who have worked for us in the Senate who don't share our views on every issue. But perhaps the best example of the unfairness of assuming that Marsha Berzon believes everything that Justice Brennan did is another former Brennan clerk, Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Many consider Judge Posner the most creative legal mind of his generation, and no one who is familiar with his law and economics philosophy would call him a liberal. 
   So let's put that fallacious line of argument to rest. 
   Listen to the praise our Judiciary Committee Chairman, my friend Sen. HATCH, heaped upon Marsha Berzon when the Committee considered her nomination before forwarding it to the full Senate. Chairman HATCH called Berzon ``one of the best lawyers I've ever seen.'' He noted in a letter supporting her nomination that her ``competence as a lawyer is beyond question'' and that she has the ``sound temperament that will serve her well as a federal judge.'' At the time Chairman HATCH also noted that Marsha Berzon had attracted ``both Republican and Democratic support.'' I am pleased that the Chairman continues to support her nomination on the floor. 
   Opponents of Marsha Berzon have questioned her credentials unfairly. Despite 
   graduating with honors from Harvard/Radcliffe college and teaching law school courses at both Cornell and Indiana University Law schools, her scholarship has been attacked. 
   Some who have opposed Berzon's nomination have even called her a labor zealot. But Mr. President, there are a number of people in this room who were attorneys before joining the Senate. They know, as do I, that the code of professional responsibility requires zealous advocacy on a client's behalf. So to mention her zeal for her practice is simply to highlight one of those qualities which makes her such a fine candidate for the 9th Circuit. It shows that she has taken her practice of law to the highest and most professional level.  
   And lest her opponents complain about professionalism and infer unfairly that a former labor lawyer cannot be fair to management, listen to what numerous management-side attorneys who have litigated against her say about Marsha Berzon. Let's take the case of W.I. Usery, Jr., a former Republican Secretary of Labor: 
   Usery said Ms. Berzon ``has all the qualifications needed, as well as the honesty and integrity that we need and deserve in our court system today..... I know she will be dedicated to the principles of fairness and impartiality in all her judicial activities.'' 
   Or perhaps, we should listen to Fred Alvarez, President Ronald Reagan's former EEOC Commissioner and Assistant Secretary of Labor. Alvarez says:  
   Someone with the intellect and integrity, which Ms. Berzon has demonstrated, understands the difference between advocacy and the solemn responsibilities undertaken as a federal appellate court judge ..... I can think of no other union-side lawyer who would command so strong and so compelling a consensus from management lawyers on her suitability for such an important position on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.  
   So there you have it Mr. President. Top Republican officials--who we can be sure favor management positions by personal philosophy--endorse Berzon and her professionalism without reservation. 
   So let's put the foolish argument that Marsha Berzon can't be fair concerning labor issues to rest. 
   Let's review. We've shown that arguments that Berzon is some liberal by her association with Justice Brennan are fallacious. We've shown that arguments that she is a zealous advocate and should be rejected as an ideologue in fact highlight her mastery of the practice of law and make her highly qualified for this position. We've exploded the myth that she is anti-management and incapable of impartiality in hearing cases pitting management versus labor, and found that she works towards reaching consensus. So one has to wonder Mr. President, what is really going on here? 
   I'm concerned about the appearance that Marsha Berzon has had such a long, hard road to confirmation because she is a woman. And I don't blame the public for taking that message from this delay when a highly qualified appellate attorney is held up for years and the arguments against her confirmation are so thin. 
   At the end of 1999, the entire federal judiciary included only 158 women--that's a scant and embarrassing 20% of sitting judges. Rather than attempting to address that disparity, this Senate has chosen to continue the policies of limiting the upward elevation of talented and capable women attorneys and judges. We've repeatedly delayed action on a host of female candidates. What's the impact? If fewer women get confirmed, there are fewer lower court judges to elevate to the nation's appellate courts. And if the judiciary remains a male bastion, as far as we've come in this country in recognizing equal rights for women, we risk creating the perception that gender biases will continue to plague our judicial system well into the 21st century. 
   I believe Ms. Berzon is highly qualified to sit on the 9th Circuit, and her confirmation should wait no longer. I enthusiastically support her and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in strong support of the nomination of Richard Paez to be a judge on the Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit. By finally moving on the nominations of Judge Paez and Ms. Marsha Berzon this week, the Senate will take long-delayed steps towards returning the 9th Circuit dockets to a manageable level. Action on these nominees is long overdue. I believe their nominations should be confirmed, and I hope, after all this delay, there will be strong bipartisan votes in favor of them. 
   Four years, 1 month, and 11 days. Just over forty-nine months. One thousand, four hundred and ninety-nine days. That's right. 1499 days, two short of 1500. That is how long Judge Richard Paez has been waiting for the Senate to act on his nomination. In the same amount of time, a young adult could enter and complete a full college degree program. Let me repeat that. Judge Paez has waited for the Senate to grant him the simple grace of voting his nomination up or down for longer than it takes a young American to complete an entire college education. A President or Governor could be inaugurated, serve his or her entire term  and be re-inaugurated during that same four year time period. While I'm sure Judge Paez is a patient man, possessed of the proper judicial temperament that makes him an excellent candidate to sit on the 9th Circuit, I know that even his patience must have long-ago worn thin waiting for the Senate to act on his nomination. 
   First nominated to fill a 9th Circuit vacancy on January 26, 1996, Judge Paez has been subject to delay after delay after delay, and yet his opponents have not been able to give a convincing reason why we shouldn't confirm his nomination. Even with his 13 year record as a LA Municipal Court Judge and nearly 6 years as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Central District of California, those who don't want him on the bench can't build a case against his elevation to the 9th Circuit. They charge that he is an ``activist judge,'' but the record simply doesn't support this allegation. 
   Judge Paez now bears the dubious distinction of suffering through the longest pendency of a nomination to the federal bench in the history of the United States. 
   All Judge Paez, has ever asked for was this opportunity: an up or down vote on his confirmation. Yet for years, the Senate has denied him that simple courtesy. 
   I find it ironic that Judge Paez, the same judge who diligently worked to reduce the length of delays in resolving civil matters in Los Angeles and throughout California's court system through his design and implementation of a civil trial delay reduction project, should himself be subjected to such egregious delay in getting his ``day in court'' before the full Senate. Particularly when the Senate confirmed his nomination for a District Court judgeship in July 1994 by unanimous consent. Now I recognize that control of this body has changed since 1994, but his nomination to the District Court was confirmed without objection. And his record on that court has been exemplary. 
   This delay has not simply been unfair to Judge Paez and his family. It has affected the administration of justice. Listen to the concerns of Procter Hug, Jr., Chief Judge of the 9th Circuit. Chief Judge Hug has responsibility for overseeing the functioning and managing the caseloads of the entire Circuit. Currently, of the 28 spots on the 9th Circuit, 6 stand vacant. Chief Judge Hug explained in a letter this past week to the Judiciary Committee that during his term as Chief Judge, the Senate has left him with up to 10 vacancies on the court at any one time. He has responded to this judicial emergency by begging his colleagues to redouble efforts to resolve cases and then increased their dockets to prevent even longer delays in resolution of cases. Hug argues forcefully for the confirmation of Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon and asks this body to swiftly fill the other 4 vacancies on the court. 
   Now Mr. President, let me address the argument made by the Majority Leader and others that the pending 9th Circuit nominations should be rejected because that circuit has a supposedly high level of reversals when its decisions are reviewed by the Supreme Court. This argument simply doesn't hold water. 
   First, if we assume that this argument is not meant to be critical of the views or qualifications Judge Paez or any other nominee personally, it makes no sense at all. Even if we disagree with the direction of that court, why would we deny the 9th Circuit adequate resources, thereby depriving the litigants in that circuit of efficient administration of justice? It just makes no sense. 
   More importantly, arguing that the Ninth Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court and needs to be reined in doesn't get opponents over the hurdle that they have not yet been able to satisfy--to show that Judge Paez is unsuitable for the appellate bench. He is obviously not responsible for past decisions of the 9th Circuit. So the argument has to be that his elevation will continue the Circuit on its supposedly misguided course. The evidence of Judge Paez being unable to follow Supreme Court precedent is thin indeed, if not non-existent. 
   But more fundamentally, it is simply not factually correct that the 9th Circuit is out of step with the Supreme Court and other circuit courts. Chief Judge Hug in his letter convincingly refutes the argument that his circuit is reversed more often than others. In fact, its clear from the numbers that even in 1996-1997, when the 9th Circuit's reversal rate was at its highest level of recent years, it was reversed less frequently than 5 other circuits--the 5th, 2nd, 7th, D.C. and Federal--each of which were reversed 100% of the time that year by the Supreme Court. In more recent years, the statistics show even more clearly that the 9th Circuit is not a runaway train that somehow needs to be slowed down, but many in the Senate would like it to become a more conservative circuit, perhaps to be broken into two conservative circuits. And they are willing to hold up Judge Paez and others to achieve that political objective. 
   Furthermore, I have to point out that reversal rates are a very poor criteria for judging a court's work. The Supreme Court is not required to review every appellate decision. It picks which cases to review. So it is hardly surprising that when it does take a case, it reverses a lower court. Chief Judge Hug quite rightly points out that the 9th Circuit decides about 4,500 cases on the merits each year. 4,500. So the fact that 10 or 20 cases per year are reversed really should not trouble us. It is just not a plausible argument against a nominee for this Circuit that its decisions are out of the mainstream. 
   We ought to congratulate the women and men currently serving on the 9th Circuit for so successfully fulfilling their judicial roles at the same time vacancies are greatly increasing their dockets and stretching their time thin. The pressure to carefully make the proper judicial decisions is great, and these Judges are responding with professionalism. I thank them for that, but I cannot help but think that we are putting an unconscionable burden on them. 
   So what is the point of raising meritless arguments against this nominee? Why the long delay? Let me suggest two possibilities, neither of which reflect well on the Senate. First, Senators delaying these nominations may be trying to run out the clock until President Clinton leaves office. Confirmations always slow down in a presidential election year. In 10 months, we will have a new President. Perhaps a different President will put forward a different nominee. But Judge Paez was actually nominated a year before the President's 2nd inaugural. So holding up this particular nomination for purely political reasons is most unfair. In some ways, this nomination should get special treatment. We had an intervening election after the nomination was first made, and President Clinton won. It is indefensible to hold a nomination hostage for his entire second term. It defies the clear constitutional prerogatives of the duly elected President to choose nominees to the bench and the duty of the Senate to say yes or no. 
   Some Senators may also object to moving the nomination of Judge Paez because of a perceived judicial philosophy. Some opponents of his nomination look to his long and distinguished service in legal aid and attempt to tar him with the epithet of ``liberal,'' forgetting that his exemplary judicial career has been filled with distinction at all levels. A close look at his record as a U.S. District Court judge since the Senate confirmed his nomination in 1994 debunks attempts to label his opinions as conservative or liberal, reactionary or progressive. 
   The Los Angeles Daily Journal, which is a newspaper devoted to covering the courts and the legal profession in Los Angeles commissioned 15 legal experts to examine Judge Paez's decisions in seven different cases. Each case was reviewed by at least 2 experts. The results were clear. Thirteen of the legal scholars and practitioners found Paez's opinions ``well-reasoned and well-written.'' Two others were mildly critical. And, in the one decision in which the experts were critical of Judge Paez's decision not to dismiss claims that Unocal Corporation was liable for human rights abuses in Burma, a third expert countered the criticism of Judge Paez's decision, saying ``I would give Judge Paez very good marks on his ruling.'' What's the point here? In a variety of decisions, the commentators praised the work of Judge Paez. Here are some of their comments:   
   I carefully read Judge Paez's opinion and found that it was excellent in every respect. 
   His writing was clear and his expression was good. He did not show any ideological or personal bias. 
   Judge Paez's injunction--in a case against anti-abortion demonstrators--was entirely consistent with the reasoning and result in conservative jurisdictions.  
   The result is that claims that the Judge's record is activist, or liberally slanted are simply wrong. Claims that he is anti-business are simply not borne out by the facts. Paez also ruled in favor of Philip Morris on a second-hand smoke suit and for Isuzu against Consumers Union. Senators opposing this nominee because they claim he's anti-business are missing the point. Paez rules on each case on the merits--yes, on the merits--and shows no favoritism for or against business. So again, Mr. President, I'm just baffled by these claims of activism or anti-business philosophy being leveled against Richard Paez. 
   Now if his record as a judge doesn't support these charges of ``judicial activism'' where did Judge Paez's opponents get the idea that he must be stopped. Opponents aren't saying it openly but it could be that they are worried that a judge who formerly worked in a legal aid capacity must be a liberal, and incapable of making balanced decisions. Having failed to find any hint of bias or lack of judicial temperament in 20 years of judicial decisions, what other reason for opposition could there be other than a belief that if you are an attorney who agrees to work on behalf of those unable to access the legal system because they are poor or under-educated, as Judge Paez did for nine years early in his career, you must be a liberal, right? 
   Wrong. Dead wrong. The organized Bar in every single state requires public service of attorneys. Every major law firm has dedicated efforts to reach under-served populations needing legal advice. That's part of the profession, a noble part of the profession, and those who would complain about Judge Paez's service to those in need would do well to remember their own reasons for choosing to serve the public. For my part, I applaud the decision of Judge Paez and others like him to serve the poor, and I cannot imagine how his unique perspective from working one on one with these populations for nine years would not be desirable and an advantage to parties before the 9th Circuit. His perspective is badly needed in a circuit which serves 20% of the nation's population, many of whom are people who needed legal aid when he was working with them during the 70s. 
   If opponents of Judge Paez want to fill the court only with seemingly conservative judges, they mistake their role in the constitutional scheme in my opinion. Let's not kid ourselves. Partisan politics shouldn't play a part in the confirmation of judges, but they do. But to hold up a well-qualified judge for a President's entire term on the basis of unsupported allegations of ``judicial activism'' is shameful, it takes the impact of politics on this process to an extreme that we have not seen before, and I hope we never see again. 
   Mr. President, regardless of the reason for delays in acting on Judge Paez's nomination, the effects of delay are damaging and unmistakable. I believe they are twofold. First, as I discussed before, justice is put on hold in the 9th Circuit because of crowded dockets. Second, this Senate sends a subtle, but unmistakable signal to Hispanic Americans, or recent immigrants about opportunities in America. 
   It's an old adage but a true one. Justice delayed is justice denied. Parties take their disputes to court to reach a resolution. Longer dockets mean delays for families and businesses seeking to settle legal conflicts and move forward. Holding up qualified nominees like Judge Paez and leaving huge holes to fill on appellate benches literally delays justice. 
   And the subtle, even subconscious message sent to Hispanic Americans when they examine who hears their disputes in a court of law is that Circuit court judgeships are not open to them. Young Hispanic Americans hearing about Judge Paez will unfortunately learn the message without it ever being said out loud that there are limitations to their advancement in careers of public service. The signals sent by Senators' failure to vote for Paez's confirmation lead to diminished expectations and a view of limited, not limitless opportunities for millions of Hispanic Americans. The Washington Post reported on Monday that only 9 Hispanic American judges currently sit on appellate courts in this country out of a total of 170 appellate judges. And only 31 out of 655 District Judges, including Judge Paez, are Hispanic Americans. That's a shameful record as we begin the 21st century. 
   Here's the message sent if Judge Paez is not confirmed. You can go to law school at UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, work tirelessly with under-served and under-represented populations needing legal assistance, be a successful and well-respected judge on the local bench and the federal District Court, get the highest rating from the American Bar Association, receive endorsements from law enforcement organizations, bar leaders, business leaders, and community leaders, and yet be needlessly and unfairly delayed and prevented from being elevated to the prestigious 9th Circuit Court of Appeals based on unsubstantiated and vague concerns that you are a ``judicial activist'' or a ``liberal.'' There is only one nominee in this position, whose nomination has been held up for over 4 years. That is Richard Paez, who is a Hispanic American. That's the wrong message from this Senate to millions of Americans, and we should not send it. 
   I strongly support Judge Paez's confirmation, and urge my colleagues to join me in quickly filling this and other vacancies on the 9th Circuit. This long delayed confirmation vote for Richard Paez is an important test for the Senate. I hope we pass it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of our colleagues in marking the 25th annual observance of International Women's Day. 
   Today, March 8, 2000, is a day on which people around the world will celebrate the myriad contributions and accomplishments of women. 
   Women in the United States and around the world have made tremendous progress toward full equality since this observance was initiated by the United Nations in 1975, the International Year of the Woman.  
   Sadly, that progress has been tempered by the continued prevalence--and in some places the troubling acceptance and even encouragement--of gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence. 
   No one disputes that women in the United States have come a long way in the quarter century since the first International Women's Day was observed. Women are making significant contributions at every level of our society and in every level of government, from local school boards to the President's Cabinet. 
   But we must do more. Quality, affordable child care must be more accessible. Women should not have to choose between taking care of their children and the job that they need to provide the basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter for their families. 
   The glass ceiling, while perhaps a bit cracked, still blocks the progress of many women who work outside the home. And women who work outside of the home deserve equal pay for equal work. We must do all we can to close the wage gap between women and their male counterparts. 
   In the United States, March is National Women's History Month. This month we celebrate the contributions of women such as Carrie Chapman Catt, a native of Ripon, Wisconsin, who served as the last president of the National American Women Suffrage Association, and was the founder and first president of the National League of Women Voters. Her influence on the direction and success of the suffrage movement is legendary, and her legacy in grassroots organizing is equally significant. She led a tireless lobbying campaign in Congress, sent letters and telegrams, and eventually met directly with the President--using all the tools of direct action with which political organizers are now so familiar today. 
   Catt's crusade for suffrage saw a home front victory on June 10, 1919, when Wisconsin became the first state to deliver ratification of the constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote before it was adopted as the Nineteenth Amendment in August of 1920. 
   Carrie Chapman Catt's legacy is alive and well today as women around the globe become more active in their communities and in the political process. 
   As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Relations, I had the opportunity late last year to travel to ten African nations. During my trip, I saw first-hand the important role that women play in every aspect of society in sub-Saharan Africa. 
   In Rwanda, I was struck by the generosity and far-sightedness of a woman I met just outside the capital city of Kigali. She had donated land to refugees from different ethnic backgrounds and was helping them to build a new, integrated community on that property. It is this kind of selfless act that will help to build the bridges that are necessary to heal the wounds left by the ethnic violence in that country. 
   While in Uganda, I had the opportunity to meet with female legislators and the Minister of Ethics and Integrity, who happens to be female. Africa can only benefit from the women who are taking an active role in governing. 
   Women's voices also need to be heard in ongoing peace negotiations around the globe. For example, it is crucial that women be included in the inter-Congolese dialogue, and that they be allowed to participate fully in Rwanda's justice system. 
   On a more somber note, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has ravaged the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. This disease affects women at a significantly higher rate than men. We need to be vigilant in preventing mother-to-child transmission and in promoting programs at home and abroad that educate women about reproductive choices and the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity, as we honor all women and girls worldwide, to again call for prompt hearings in the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, of which I am a member, on the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). CEDAW marked its 20th anniversary last year and still has not been ratified by one of its chief architects--the United States. The Senate should fulfill its constitutional responsibility to offer its advice and consent on this treaty. 
   Mr. President, as the father of two daughters, I believe we must do all we can to improve the status of women in the United States and around the world. Respect for basic human rights--regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, or sexual orientation--is a fundamental value that we must pass on to our children and grandchildren. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment of Senator BINGAMAN and Senator KENNEDY to raise the maximum individual Pell grant to $3,700, an increase of $400. 
   Higher education is one of the most vital keys to open the door to success in this country. Without a college degree, or significant postsecondary education, it is a lot harder to find a successful path through today's labor market. Without Pell grants, many individuals simply can't consider college. Without a college degree or serious postsecondary training, some employers won't consider hiring these individuals. 
   In general, workers with a bachelor's degree are much better off financially compared to less-educated workers. In 1998, the average male college graduate earned about 92 percent more than the average high school graduate. 
   While I commend the supporters of this legislation for their desire to promote increased access to an affordable higher education, I think their approach is seriously flawed. Specifically, I take exception with those who believe that the education IRA component of this legislation is the best way to help increase accessibility to affordable education. Instead of helping those truly in need, as Senator BINGAMAN has said, this provision would disproportionately help the most affluent families and provide little or no assistance to low- and middle-income families.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Administration's decision to send urgently needed assistance to southern Africa, where heavy rains have caused devastating floods, particularly in the Republic of Mozambique. 
   Last night President Clinton approved the deployment of a Joint Task Force to the region, including C-130 aircraft to deliver desperately needed supplies, and six heavy lift helicopters  to pluck survivors from the trees and rooftops where they cling to life. This assistance will supplement the efforts already underway, under the auspices of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Department of Defense. 
   Mr. President, this assistance comes not a moment too soon. Meteorologists believe that even more rain is likely to fall on the region in the very near future. The resources the world has already provided are stretched nearly to the breaking point, as the need to deliver food and other supplies to survivors competes with the need to rescue those precariously hanging on above the floodwaters, waiting to be evacuated to dry land. The Mozambican families who survived the threat of rising waters are now at risk again, as water-born diseases like cholera, malaria, and meningitis surge in the flood's aftermath. 
   These floods are particularly tragic because the country most seriously affected by them, Mozambique, has made significant strides toward recovery from its long and brutal civil war. Though the country is still affected by extreme poverty, in recent years Mozambique has enjoyed exceptional rates of economic growth, and while more needs to be done, the country has improved its record with regard to basic human rights. Mr. President, the people of Mozambique have been fighting for a better future. This kind of disaster comes at a terrible time, but our intercession may help the people of Mozambique to hold to the opportunities that lay before them before the waters rose. 
   The American government and the American people have reached out beyond our borders time and again to aid communities in crisis--from the earthquake victims in Turkey and Taiwan to the mudslide survivors in Venezuela. We stand united in a basic expression of human compassion again today. I applaud the Administration's action; I believe it is an entirely appropriate use of our country's resources, and I wish the people of southern Africa the very best as they work to recover from these devastating floods.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to mark International Abolition Day. This day marks the occasion in 1847 when the state of Michigan became the first English-speaking territory in the world to abolish capital punishment. As one of the first acts following conferral of statehood on Michigan, the Michigan legislature abolished the death penalty for all crimes except treason. I note, with tongue and cheek and with all due respect to my distinguished colleagues from Michigan, that the date marking International Abolition Day probably should be 1853, when my great state, the state of Wisconsin, became the first state to abolish the death penalty for all crimes. Wisconsin has been death penalty-free for nearly 150 years. It is clear that the people of the Midwestern states have shown great courage and leadership on this issue since almost the birth of our great Nation. 
   Mr. President, International Abolition Day is a day to remember the victims and survivors of violent crimes perpetrated by individual criminals. But it is also a day to remember those killed by state-sponsored executions. And it is a day for education and discussion of alternatives to the death penalty. 
   Just as the people of Michigan over 150 years ago learned the painful reality of the fallibility of our criminal justice system and confronted the death penalty's main use, as a tool of vengeance, people throughout the United States today are beginning to question their longstanding support for the death penalty. On January 31, Governor Ryan effectively imposed a moratorium on executions in Illinois until a state panel can examine the administration of the death penalty and why so many innocents have sat on Illinois' death row. In a recent Gallup poll, even though a majority of Americans still support the death penalty, support for the death penalty is at a 19-year low. And when asked whether Americans prefer the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, support for the death penalty drops even further. 
   These are just some of the many positive developments that have nurtured the reawakening of the American conscience to the great responsibility and stain that state-sponsored executions place on our society. I look forward to the day when our federal government and the 38 states with the death penalty will recognize the adequacy of sentencing alternatives and abolish this barbaric punishment for all time.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Consumer Credit Fair Dispute Resolution Act of 2000, a bill that will protect and preserve American consumers' right to take their disputes with creditors to court. This bill is identical to an amendment that I offered recently to the bankruptcy reform bill. 
   In recent years, credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly requiring their customers to use binding arbitration when a dispute arises. Consumers are barred by contract from taking a dispute to court, even small claims court. While arbitration can be an efficient tool to settle claims, it is credible and effective only when consumers enter into it knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. Unfortunately, that's not happening in the credit card and consumer credit lending arenas. 
   One of the most fundamental principles of our justice system is the constitutional right to take a dispute to court. Indeed, all Americans have the right in civil and criminal cases to a trial by jury. The right to a jury trial in criminal cases is contained in the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution. The right to a jury trial in civil cases is contained in the Seventh Amendment, which provides ``In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. . . .'' 
   Some argue that Americans are over-using the courts. Court dockets across the country are congested with civil cases. In part as a response to these concerns, various ways to resolve disputes have been developed, short of going to court. Alternatives to court litigation are collectively known as alternative dispute resolution, or ADR. ADR includes mediation and arbitration. Mediation and arbitration are often efficient ways to resolve disputes because the parties can have their case heard well before they would have received a trial date in court. 
   Mediation is conducted by a neutral third party--the mediator--who meets with the opposing parties to help them find a mutually satisfactory solution. Unlike a judge in a courtroom, the mediator has no power to impose a solution. No formal rules of evidence or procedure control mediation; the mediator and the parties mutually agree on the best way to proceed. 
   Arbitration also involves a third party--an arbitrator or arbitration panel. Unlike mediation but similar to a court proceeding, the arbitrator issues a decision after reviewing the arguments by all parties. Arbitration uses rules of evidence and procedure, although it may use rules that are simpler or more flexible than the evidentiary and procedural rules that the parties would follow in a court proceeding. 
   Arbitration can be either binding or non-binding. Non-binding arbitration means that the decision issued by the arbitrator or arbitration panel takes effect only if the parties agree to it after they know what the decision is. In binding arbitration, parties agree in advance to accept and abide by the decision, whatever it is. 
   Some contracts contain clauses that require arbitration to be used to resolve disputes that arise after the contract is signed. This is called ``mandatory arbitration.'' This means that if there is a dispute, the complaining party cannot file suit in court and instead is required to pursue arbitration. ``Mandatory, binding arbitration'' therefore means that under the contract, the parties must use arbitration to resolve a future disagreement and the decision of the arbitrator or arbitration panel is final. The parties have no ability to seek relief in court or through mediation. In fact, if they are not satisfied with the arbitration outcome, they are probably stuck with the decision.  
   Under mandatory, binding arbitration, even if a party believes that the arbitrator did not consider all the facts or follow the law, the party cannot file a suit in court. The only basis for challenging a binding arbitration decision is if there is reason to believe that the arbitrator committed actual fraud. In contrast, if a dispute is resolved by a court, the parties can potentially pursue an appeal of the lower court's decision. 
   Mr. President, because mandatory, binding arbitration is so conclusive, it can be a credible means of dispute resolution only when all parties understand the full ramifications of agreeing to it. 
   But that's not what's happening in a variety of contexts--from motor vehicle franchise agreements, to employment agreements, to credit card agreements. I'm proud to have sponsored legislation addressing employment agreements and motor vehicle franchise agreements. In fact, I am the original cosponsor with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, of S. 1020, which would prohibit the unilateral imposition of mandatory, binding arbitration in motor vehicle dealership agreements with manufacturers. Many of our colleagues have joined us as cosponsors. 
   Similar to the problem in the motor vehicle dealership franchise context, there is a 
   growing, menacing trend of credit card companies and consumer credit lenders inserting mandatory, binding arbitration clauses in agreements with consumers. Companies like First USA Bank, American Express and Green Tree Discount Company unilaterally insert mandatory, binding arbitration clauses in their agreements with consumers, often without the consumer's knowledge or consent. 
   The most common way credit card companies have done this is through the use of a ``bill stuffer.'' Bill stuffers are the advertisements and other materials that credit card companies insert into envelopes with their customers' monthly statements. Some credit card issuers like American Express have placed fine print mandatory arbitration clauses in bill stuffers. The arbitration provision is usually buried in fine print in a mailing that includes a bill and various advertising materials. It is often described in a lengthy legal document that most consumers probably don't even skim, much less read carefully. 
   American Express issued its mandatory arbitration provision last year. It took effect on June 1st. So, if you're an American Express cardholder and you have a dispute with American Express, as of June 1999, you can't take your claim to court, even small claims court. You are bound to use arbitration, and you are bound to the final arbitration decision. In this case, you are also bound to use an arbitration organization selected by American Express, the National Arbitration Forum. 
   American Express isn't the only credit card company imposing mandatory arbitration on its customers. First USA Bank, the largest issuer of Visa cards, with 58 million customers, has been doing the same thing since 1997. First USA also alerted its cardholders with a bill stuffer, containing a condensed set of terms and conditions in fine print. The cardholder, by virtue of continuing to use the First USA card, gave up the right to go to court, even small claims court, to resolve a dispute. 
   Mr. President, this growing practice extends beyond credit cards into the consumer loan industry. Consumer credit lenders like Green Tree Consumer Discount Company are inserting mandatory, binding arbitration clauses in their loan agreements. The problem is that these loan agreements are usually adhesion contracts, which means that consumers must either sign the agreement as is, or forego a loan. In other words, consumers lack the bargaining power to have the clause removed. More importantly, when signing on the dotted line of the loan agreement, consumers may not even understand what mandatory arbitration means. In all likelihood, they do not understand that they have just signed away a right to go to court to resolve a dispute with the lender. 
   It might be argued that if consumers are not pleased with being subjected to a mandatory arbitration clause, they can cancel their credit card, or not execute on their loan agreement, and take their business elsewhere. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done. As I mentioned, First USA Bank, the nation's largest Visa card issuer, is part of this questionable practice. In fact, the practice is becoming so pervasive that consumers may soon no longer have an alternative, unless they forego use of a credit card or a consumer loan entirely. Consumers should not be forced to make that choice. 
   Companies like First USA, American Express and Green Tree argue that they rely on mandatory arbitration to resolve disputes faster and cheaper than court litigation. The claim may be resolved faster but is it really cheaper? Is it as fair as a court of law? I don't think so. Arbitration organizations often charge exorbitant fees to the consumer who brings a dispute--often an initial filing fee plus hourly fees to the arbitrator or arbitrators involved in the case. These costs can be much higher than bringing the matter to small claims court and paying a court filing fee. 
   For example, the National Arbitration Forum, the arbitration entity of choice for American Express and First USA charges fees that are likely greater than if the consumer brought a dispute in small claims court. For a claim of less than $1,000, the National Arbitration Forum charges the consumer a $49 filing fee. In contrast, a consumer can bring the same claim to small claims court here in the District of Columbia for a filing fee of no more than $10. In other words, the consumer pays a fee to the National Arbitration Forum that is nearly five times more than the fee for filing a case in small claims court. 
   That's bad enough, but some other arbitration firms are even more expensive. The American Arbitration Association charges a $500 filing fee for claims of less than $10,000, or more if the claim exceeds $10,000, and a minimum filing fee of $2,000 if the case involves three or more arbitrators. In addition to the filing fee, it also charges a hearing fee for holding hearings other than the initial hearing--$150 to be paid by each party for each day of hearings before a single arbitrator, or $250 if the hearing is held before an arbitration panel. The International Chamber of Commerce requires a $2,500 administrative fee plus an arbitrator's fee of at least $2,500, if the claim is less than $50,000. These fees are greater if the claim exceeds $50,000. The fees could very well be greater than the consumer's claim. So, as you can see, a consumer's claim is not necessarily resolved more efficiently with arbitration. It is resolved either at greater cost to the consumer or not at all, if the consumer cannot afford the costs, or the costs outweigh the amount in dispute. 
   Another significant problem with mandatory, binding arbitration is that the lender gets to decide in advance who the arbitrator will be. In the case of American Express and First USA, they have chosen the National Arbitration Forum. All credit card disputes with consumers involving American Express or First USA are handled by that entity. There would seem to be a significant danger that this would result in an advantage for the lenders who are ``repeat players.'' After all, if the National Arbitration Forum develops a pattern of reaching decisions that favor cardholders, American Express or First USA may very well decide to take their arbitration business elsewhere. A system where the arbitrator has a financial interest in reaching an outcome that favors the credit card company is not a fair alternative dispute resolution system. 
   There has been one important court decision on the enforceability of mandatory arbitration provisions in credit card agreements. The case arose out of a mandatory arbitration provision announced in mailings to Bank of America credit card and deposit account holders. In 1998, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the mandatory arbitration clauses unilaterally imposed on the Bank's customers were invalid and unenforceable. The California Supreme Court refused to review the decision of the lower court. As a result, credit card companies in California cannot invoke mandatory arbitration in their disputes with customers. In fact, the American Express bill stuffer notes that the mandatory, binding arbitration provision will not apply to California residents until further notice from the company. The California appellate court decision was wise and  well-reasoned, but consumers in other states cannot be sure that all courts will reach the same conclusion. 
   My bill extends the wisdom of the California appellate decision to every credit cardholder and consumer loan borrower. It amends the Federal Arbitration Act to invalidate mandatory, binding arbitration provisions in consumer credit agreements. Now, let me be clear. I believe that arbitration can be a fair and efficient way to settle disputes. I agree we ought to encourage alternative dispute resolution. But I also believe that arbitration is a fair way to settle disputes between consumers and lenders only when it is entered into knowingly and voluntarily by both parties to the dispute after the dispute has arisen. Pre-dispute agreements to take disputes to arbitration cannot be voluntary and knowing in the consumer lending context because the bargaining power of the parties is so unequal. My bill does not prohibit arbitration of consumer credit transactions. It merely prohibits mandatory, binding arbitration provisions in consumer credit agreements. 
   Credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly slamming the courthouse doors shut on consumers, often unbeknownst to them. This is grossly unjust. We need to restore fairness to the resolution of consumer credit disputes. I urge my colleagues to support the Consumer Credit Fair Dispute Resolution Act.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to share my views on the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2000 (S. 1287). Specifically, I want to explain why I will continue to oppose this legislation in its current form. 
   Let me first express my grave concern about the process by which this legislation has been developed over the last few days. My office received a new version of this legislation, which eventually was proposed as a substitute amendment, nearly every day last week. Closed negotiations have continued even while the bill has been on the floor. For those of us who have utilities in our states that are grappling with nuclear waste storage questions, this made it nearly impossible to analyze this bill on behalf of our constituents. The issues presented in this legislation are serious policy issues, and our constituents deserve better information. 
   I am principally opposed to this bill because it does little to address the nuclear waste storage question in my home state of Wisconsin. Wisconsinites want nuclear waste removed from our state and stored in a permanent geologic repository out of state so that it has no chance of coming back to Wisconsin. I opposed nuclear waste legislation in the last Congress which sought to build large scale interim storage facilities before the permanent storage site is ready and would have jeopardized consideration of the permanent site. This year's bill would have provided federal funds for on-site storage of nuclear waste until the permanent storage site at Yucca Mountain was ready to take our waste. 
   The substitute amendment stripped out the on-site storage provisions. This bill now does nothing to address the waste situation at the majority of Wisconsin's nuclear plants. The bill, as amended by the substitute amendment, does contain a specific section which would address the nuclear waste situation at the La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor, which is owned by Dairyland Power and has been shut down for years. The Dairyland language is something that I have supported and will continue to support, but I had hoped this legislation would be able to extend similar relief to other Wisconsin utilities. 
   With the on-site storage provisions stripped out, the bill retains a loosely knit collection of provisions that seem unlikely to have a beneficial impact on the country's nuclear waste program. The bill requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's and the National Academy of Sciences' concurrence in the radiation exposure standard that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is drafting--an entirely new procedure. If those entities do not agree, the responsibility to set the standard comes back to Congress. I am concerned that if those entities cannot agree it is likely that Congress can not do much better to resolve the issues. 
   One of my other concerns has always been the safety and security of shipping nuclear materials from their current locations to a permanent geologic storage site outside of the state. Obviously, there is a risk that, during the transportation, accidents may occur. Although the legislation provides for emergency response training in the jurisdictions through which nuclear material would be transported, I still feel that these provisions need to be strengthened to ensure that state and local governments have the financial and equipment resources they need to respond to accidents. 
   In conclusion, I cannot support legislation which purports to fix the country's nuclear waste program and leaves Wisconsin so far behind. I continue to remain hopeful that legislation in this area can be crafted that can win my support.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the President sent a nomination to the Senate that anyone who cares about the campaign finance laws in this country will find very troubling. I speak of the nomination of Bradley Smith to a 6-year term on the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Smith's views on the federal election laws, as expressed in law review articles, interviews, op-eds, speeches over the past half decade are disturbing, to say the least. He should not be on the regulatory body charged with enforcing and interpreting those very laws. 
   Today I am placing a very public hold on this nomination. I will object to its consideration on the floor and I ask all of my colleagues who support campaign finance reform to oppose this nomination. 
   In a 1997 opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Smith wrote the following:  
   When a law is in need of continual revision to close a series of ever-changing ``loopholes,'' it is probably the law, and not the people, that is in error. The most sensible reform is a simple one: repeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  
   That's right, the man who the President has just nominated to serve on the Federal Election Commission believes the Federal campaign laws should be repealed. Thomas Jefferson said we should have a revolution in this country every 20 years. He believed that laws should constantly be revised and revisited to make sure they were responsive to the needs of society at any given time. Yet, Mr. Smith sees the need for loophole closing in the federal election laws as evidence that the whole system should be scrapped. 
   In a policy paper published by the Cato Institute, for whom Mr. Smith has written extensively in recent years, he says the following:  
   FECA [the Federal Election Campaign Act] and its various state counterparts are profoundly undemocratic and profoundly at odds with the First Amendment.  
   I wonder how Mr. Smith will reconcile those views with his new position as one of six individuals responsible for enforcing and 
   implementing the statute and any future reforms that the Congress might pass. He has shown such extreme disdain in his writings and public statements for the very law he would be charged to enforce that I simply do not think he should be entrusted with this important responsibility. 
   It is especially ironic and disheartening that this nomination has been made at a time when the prospects for reform and the legal landscape for those reforms have never looked better. We are all aware that certain Presidential candidates have highlighted campaign finance issues with great success. The public is more aware than ever of the critical need for reform. Campaign finance reform is and will be a major issue in the 2000 Presidential race. 
   In addition, just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court issued a ringing reaffirmation of the core holding of the Buckley decision that forms the basis for the reform effort. The Court once again held that Congress has the constitutional power to limit contributions to political campaigns in order to protect the integrity of the political process from corruption or the appearance of corruption. In upholding contribution limits imposed by the Missouri legislature, Justice Souter wrote for the Court:  
   [T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.  
   In my view, the Supreme Court's ruling in the Shrink Missouri case removes all doubt as to whether the Court would uphold the constitutionality of a ban on soft money, which is the centerpiece of the reform bill that has passed the House and is now awaiting Senate action. One hundred twenty-seven legal scholars have written to us that a soft money ban is constitutional, and their analysis is strongly supported by this very recent decision of the Supreme Court. 
   Mr. Smith has a wholly different view of the core holding of Buckley, on which the arguments supporting the  constitutionality of banning soft money relies. He wrote the following in a 1997 law review article:  
   Whatever the particulars of reform proposals, it is increasingly clear that reformers have overstated the government interest in the anticorruption rationale. Money's alleged corrupting influence are far from proven. ....... [T]hat portion of Buckley that relies on the anticorruption rationale is itself the weakest portion of the Buckley opinion--both in its doctrinal foundations and in its empirical ramifications.  
   In another article, Mr. Smith writes: ``I do think that Buckley is probably wrong in allowing contribution limits.'' 
   Mr. Smith's view, as quoted by the Columbus Dispatch, is that ``people should be allowed to spend whatever they want on politics.'' In an interview on MSNBC, he said, ``I think we should deregulate and just let it go. That's how our politics was run for over 100 years.'' 
   He is right about that. Mr. Smith would have us go back to the late 19th century, before Theodore Roosevelt pushed through the 1907 Tillman Act, which prohibited corporate contributions to federal elections. Mr. Smith has expressed the view that a soft money ban would be unconstitutional. He wrote the following in a paper for the Notre Dame Law School Journal of Legislation:  
   [R]egardless of what one thinks about soft money, or what one thinks about the applicable Supreme Court precedents, a blanket ban on soft money would be, under clear, well-established First Amendment doctrine, constitutionally infirm.  
   A majority of this Senate has voted repeatedly in favor of a soft money ban. I cannot imagine that that same majority will vote to confirm a nominee who believes such a ban is unconstitutional. We need an FEC that will vote to enforce the law and to interpret it in a way that is consistent with congressional intent. I simply have no confidence--I do not know how I can get confidence--that Mr. Smith will be able do that--how can he? It would be completely at odds with his own loudly professed principles. 
   This is not a matter of personality. I have never met Mr. Smith. I am sure he is a good person. I do not question his right to criticize the laws from his outside perch as a law professor and commentator. But his views on the very laws he will be called upon to enforce give rise to grave doubt as to whether he can faithfully execute the duties of a Commissioner on the FEC. It is simply not possible for him to distance himself from views he has repeatedly and stridently expressed now that he is nominated. We would not accept such disclaimers from individuals nominated to head other agencies of Government. 
   The campaign finance laws are not undemocratic. They are not unconstitutional. They are essential to the functioning of our democratic process and to the faith of the people in their government. As the Supreme Court said in the Shrink Missouri case:  
   Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance. Democracy works only if the people have faith in those who govern, and that faith is bound to be shattered when high officials and their appointees engage in activities which arouse suspicions of ``malfeasance and corruption.''  
   In the wake of that clear declaration by the Court, how can Bradley Smith continue to rationalize the gutting of the Federal Election Campaign Act? And how can we allow him the chance to carry it out as a member of the FEC? 
   We need FEC Commissioners who understand and accept the simple and basic precepts about the influence of money on our political system that the Court reemphasized in the Shrink Missouri case. We need FEC Commissioners who believe in the laws they are sworn to uphold. We do not need FEC Commissioners who have an ideological agenda contrary to the core rationale of the laws they must administer. 
   The public is entitled to FEC Commissioners who they can be confident will not work to gut the efforts of Congress to provide fair and democratic rules to govern our political systems. I will oppose this nomination and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today because I share the concern of many of my colleagues about the situation in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. I especially thank my colleagues from Alaska and Hawaii for their leadership, and I am very glad this legislation is before us. 
   Allegations of human trafficking, grossly sub-standard working conditions, deceitful recruitment practices, even indentured servitude, must be taken seriously--particularly when these practices are alleged to occur on American soil. 
   I also rise to highlight some very relevant issues about which I am deeply concerned. As we consider the case of the CNMI, we must recognize that there are other examples of this kind of international exploitation, and that such practices often find their roots in organized crime syndicates that span boundaries, and patterns of corruption that cross borders. 
   In fact, according to a report issued by the nongovernmental organization, the Global Survival Network, on the situation in the CNMI,  
   ..... organized crime groups from the People's Republic of China, South Asia, and Japan reap large profits from human trafficking. Chinese provincial government agencies reportedly collude with Chinese traffickers by pocketing a percentage of passport fees paid by Chinese immigrants. Chinese criminal groups have moved part of their operations to the CNMI, where they operate significant gambling and money-lending operations. Japanese organized crime groups also operate in Saipan, where they control a large part of the sex tourism sector.  
   Let this be a wake-up call for all of us--international crime is an increasingly disturbing problem, and it is not something that happens only in other parts of the world. This is an issue that I intend to work on in the months ahead. 
   According to NGO estimates, between 1 million and 2 million women are trafficked each year for the purposes of forced prostitution, many of them from Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In 1998, the FBI indicated that, of the Russian crime cases they had investigated abroad, 55 percent involved fraud, 22 percent money laundering, and the rest murder, extortion, and the smuggling of people, arms, and drugs. These kinds of activities are global phenomenon, and the United States is not immune to these forces. 
   Members of this body are all too familiar with the role of Colombian and Nigerian criminal organizations in the drug trade that casts a shadow over virtually every American community today--including my own hometown. 
   We have all been alarmed by last year's revelations about the laundering of Russian money through U.S. banks. Recent reports indicate that Poland is overwhelmed in its efforts to combat money laundering schemes--many of which have an international component.  
   In fact, some 170 Polish gangs have ties with criminal groups abroad. Too often, money-laundering schemes entail the buying-off of corrupt officials, creating a cycle of complicity that undermines the rule of law, stability, and the very legitimacy of government itself. 
   Few would dispute the fact that corruption played a role in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, or that it hampers political, social, and economic development throughout a region that I care deeply about--sub-Saharan Africa, a region where international crime and corruption often go hand-in-hand. The GAO has reported that Americans lose up to $2 billion per year to African-based white collar crime syndicates. In Angola and Sierra Leone, corruption fuels the trade in illicit diamonds, which in turn finances brutally violent conflicts. There can be no doubt that international crime and corruption are critical security issues and economic issues--but there can also be no doubt that they are human rights issues, and social development issues as well. 
   These patterns will increasingly have an impact on the lives of Americans in this new century, and the manner in which we respond will determine, in part, the degree to which all people of all nations can achieve a better life in the years ahead. 
   Mr. President, I intend to look more closely at these trends in international crime and corruption in the months ahead. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have been a long-time critic of the Navy's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet program. For years, I have come to the floor to highlight this program's shortcomings, and I have offered bills to kill the program and amendments to try to achieve greater scrutiny over the program. Sometimes my colleagues have agreed with me, and more often than not, they have not on this particular issue. I understand that, in all probability, the Super Hornet program will get its final green light this spring, and it will go into full-rate production. 
   However, I will continue to fight for responsible defense spending and continue to try to enlighten my colleagues about this inferior, unnecessary, and expensive program. 
   With that in mind, I have asked Secretary Cohen to delay his production decision until he reviews a GAO audit of the Super Hornet program's Operational Evaluation. 
   I will read an opinion-editorial by Lieutenant Colonel Jay Stout, a highly-regarded, active duty Marine fighter pilot of the F/A-18C, and combat veteran. The Virginian-Pilot published his opinions this past December. 
   Rear Admiral J.B. Nathman, the Navy's director of air warfare, wrote the requisite, tired response, with a little personal invective thrown in. 
   A subsequent piece by James Stevenson, a well-known aviation writer, rebuts each of Admiral Nathman's arguments. I will read Stevenson's letter, as well.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm the nomination of Alan Greenspan to another term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. While I continue to have some concerns about some of the day-to-day management of the Federal Reserve System, he has helped sustain a period of economic growth that few would have predicted a few years ago. 
   Mr. President, when I first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1992, my highest priority was reducing the Federal budget deficit. In 1992, that deficit stood at $340 billion. This past fiscal year, we balanced the budget. That is an enormous achievement, and it was due to the tough fiscal policies of Congress, particularly the 1993 deficit reduction package, and Chairman Greenspan stewardship at the Federal Reserve. Both were integral to our economy's growth and to the resulting improvement in our budget picture, and I credit Chairman Greenspan for his part in that effort. 
   I do want to make clear that I have some continuing concerns regarding the Federal Reserve, concerns that stem in part from a 1996 General Accounting Office report which reviewed the Federal Reserve System. Noting that there were no strong external forces to minimize Federal Reserve costs, the report identified weaknesses in existing oversight and budgetary processes which resulted in a number of troubling issues. The GAO found a $4 billion cash reserve known as a Surplus Account that the Federal Reserve exempted from its policy of returning all its net profits to the Treasury. The report found evidence from its policy of returning all its net profits to the Treasury. The report found evidence of inefficiencies and excessive spending, and specifically identified the construction of a Federal Reserve Bank as well as overly generous travel, salaries, and employee benefits. 
   The report noted at least one major instance, the construction of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, in which the Federal Reserve missed an opportunity to save money, including the purchase of unnecessary land at the cost of $7 million. 
   The GAO also reported that some employees had home security systems installed by the Federal Reserve, costing from $2,500 to $8,000, while others had home-to-work transportation using Federal Reserve vehicles. And the GAO found Federal Reserve travel expenses had risen by nearly 67 percent between 1988 and 1994, from $28.5 million in 1988 to $47 million in 1994, compared to only 26 percent for the Federal government. 
   Mr. President, it should be noted that the Federal Reserve did respond to the GAO findings by establishing annual audits of their Reserve banks, and I credit that action.  
   Those annual audits have since been codified, along with annual audits of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve System by a provision added to the financial modernization bill, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. That audit provision was added to the financial modernization bill by the Senator from Nevada (Mr. REID) and the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. DORGAN). They have been vigilant on this matter, and in fact they were the original requesters of the 1996 GAO report. 
   The Reid-Dorgan audit requirements are an important step, and I am greatly encouraged by it, but we should go further. I feel strongly that we should ask the GAO to update its 1996 report on the Federal Reserve, and hope Chairman Greenspan will join in such a request. 
   We cannot have a complete understanding of current management practices at the Fed until we hear from the GAO again on this matter, however, I am willing to give Chairman Greenspan the benefit of the doubt. The audit requirements added to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act do represent an improvement, and I was encouraged by the modest step taken by the Fed in response to the 1996 GAO report. 
   Mr. President, I opposed this nomination four years ago, and I very much look forward to a needed update of the GAO audit of the Federal Reserve. However, given his remarkable record in helping to sustain the economic growth of the past several years and in the improvement in our budget picture, I will vote to confirm Chairman Greenspan.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Let me first thank my colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, for her comments and leadership on this issue, and in particular the work we started together last fall and her determination with regard to the amendment that we are quite determined to make sure stays in the African Growth and Opportunity Bill. 
   I also especially thank Senator DURBIN, who came back from Africa in December with a tremendous passion on this issue, for using his enormous leadership skills to bring us together on a bipartisan basis to try to help fight this problem. I am grateful for his leadership and for his having the idea that we should come together in the Chamber to make some comments. 
   As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Africa, I have always felt very strongly about the issue of AIDS in Africa. I have raised it in the context of the African debate. I have had success in some areas but not in others. I had a chance to raise it in December in personal meetings in their own countries with 10 different African Presidents. 
   I applaud the United Nations Security Council's decision to address the crisis last month. I want to especially mention our Ambassador to the U.N., Richard Holbrooke, whose idea it was to have such a session, and I support the administration's call to increase the resources directed at the crisis. I am especially pleased to stand with my colleagues to raise the issue again today. 
   I have heard some of the statistics, but I think they bear repetition. 
   In 1998 alone, AIDS killed 2 million Africans. At least 12 million Africans have been killed by AIDS since the onset of the crisis. Africa accounts for over half of the world's cases of HIV. According to World Bank President James Wolfensohn, the disease has left 10 million African children in its wake. 
   In Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, 25 percent of the people between the ages of 15 and 19 are HIV positive. 
   By 2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people than it would have had if there has been no AIDS epidemic. 
   My recent trip to 10 African countries only renewed my resolve to address this matter with the urgency and seriousness it deserves. 
   In Namibia, HIV-positive citizens pulled up to a meeting in a van with curtained windows, and they hurried to the safety of the meeting room as soon as they arrived. They feared that their identity would be revealed, and that the stigma still attached to the disease would cause them to lose their jobs and perhaps even to be disowned by their families. It was shocking--in a country gripped by the epidemic, people are still afraid to acknowledge the crisis. 
   In Zambia I visited an orphanage of sorts, where 500 children, many of them orphaned when AIDS killed their parents, gathered by day. At night, there is only room for 50 of them--the rest must make their own arrangements, and many end up sleeping on the streets, sometimes prostituting themselves--thereby risking exposure to HIV in their struggle to survive. 
   In Zimbabwe, life expectancy has dropped from 65 to 39. Let me repeat that: life expectancy in Zimbabwe dropped from 65 to 39. Walking past the Parliament building one day, I asked how old one had to be to become a legislator there. The answer was 40. That exchange helped me to grasp how far-reaching the consequences of this disease really are--no society is structured in a way that prepares it to deal with an unchecked epidemic like AIDS. 
   In July 1999, the National Institutes of Health released a report on the effectiveness of a drug called nevirapine, the drug Senator FEINSTEIN mentioned, in preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Studies indicate that this drug can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission by as much as 80 percent. 
   As she said, NVP costs $4 per tablet. This relatively simple and inexpensive drug regimen has created an unprecedented opportunity for 
   international cooperation in the fight against the vertical transmission of HIV. 
   It should be recognized that Uganda is making real headway with regard to prevention. Since 1992, the Ugandan government's very frank and high-profile public education efforts have helped to reduce the incidence of HIV infection by more than 15 percent. 
   But despite these positive signs, there are many fronts on which there has been very little progress. Virtually no one has access to drugs to treat the disease. Prevention is unquestionably the most important element of the equation, but treatment cannot be ignored. Poverty should not be a death sentence--not when the infectious disease that is destroying African society can be treated. 
   Again, because Senator FEINSTEIN and I, and I know Senator DURBIN, are determined on this, we offered an amendment to the African Growth and Opportunity Act that was accepted into the Senate version of that legislation. It prohibits federal money from being used to lobby governments to change TRIPS-compliant laws allowing access to HIV/AIDS drugs. Basically, it just says that taxpayer money shouldn't be used to prevent countries from taking international legal measures in this AIDS emergency. I strongly urge the conferees to support that amendment. 
   The AIDS crisis in Africa is just what the TRIPS agreement was meant to address. This is a crisis, an emergency on an incomprehensibly vast scale. This is the rare and urgent situation that calls for something beyond a dogmatic approach to intellectual property rights. 
   If allowing for a TRIPS-compliant response seems expensive, think how expensive it will be, in the long run, not to do so. Even beyond the human tragedy, there are vast economic costs to this epidemic. AIDS affects the most productive segment of society. It is turning the future leaders of the region into a generation of orphans. 
   It is simply unconscionable for the U.S. government to fight the legal efforts of African states to save their people from this plague. I cannot imagine why any of my colleagues would support such action. Those dissatisfied with the TRIPS agreement should focus their efforts on changing it--not on twisting the arms of countries in crisis who comply with international law. 
   I thank my colleague from Illinois and I look forward to all the efforts we will take on together on this issue, and I look forward to working with Members of the other party on this as well. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is what we have referred to in this debate on the bankruptcy bill as the ``landlord-tenant amendment.'' We had extensive debate on this amendment in November before we recessed for the year. We did make some progress in identifying the areas of dispute and, I think, in narrowing our differences as well. 
   To remind my colleagues, this amendment is designed to reduce the harsh consequences of section 311 of the bill on tenants, while at the same time protecting legitimate financial interests of landlords. 
   To review, current law provides for an automatic stay of eviction proceedings upon the filing of a bankruptcy case. Landlords can apply for relief from that stay so the eviction can proceed, but it is a process that often takes a few months. 
   What section 311 of the bill does is eliminate the stay in all landlord-tenant cases so an eviction can proceed immediately, completely, regardless of the circumstances. 
   What my amendment would do is allow tenants to remain in their apartments as they try to sort out the difficult consequences of bankruptcy, if--and only if--they are willing to pay the rent that comes due after they file for bankruptcy or that comes due within the 10 days before bankruptcy. 
   If the tenant fails to pay rent, the stay can be lifted without further proceedings 15 days after the landlord provides notice to the court that the rent has not been paid. If the reason for the eviction is  drug use or property damage, the stay can also be lifted after 15 days. Finally, if the lease has actually expired by its terms--in other words, if there is no more time on the lease--and if the landlord or a member of his or her family plans to move in to the property, then again, after 15 days notice, the eviction can proceed. 
   There is no 15-day notice period, with a chance for the tenant to go into court and challenge the allegations of the landlord, if the tenant has filed for bankruptcy previously. In other words in cases of repeat filings, the stay never takes effect, just as under section 311 in this bill. That is the main abuse that has been alleged in Los Angeles County, where unscrupulous bankruptcy petition preparers advertise filing bankruptcy as a way to live ``rent free.'' So under my amendment, a debtor can never live ``rent free.'' The debtor has to pay rent after filing for bankruptcy. If a debtor misses a rent payment, the stay will be lifted 15 days later. And the automatic stay does not take effect at all if the tenant is a repeat filer. 
   So my amendment gets at the abuse, and it protects the rights and economic interests of the landlord. What it eliminates is the punitive aspect of Section 311, and the possibility that tenants who are willing and able to pay rent once they get a little breathing room from their other creditors will instead be put out on the street. I am frankly disappointed that my colleague from Alabama, with whom I have had a good debate on this issue, and the property owners organizations are insisting on the harsh aspects of section 311 when my amendment would get at the problems they have identified just as well. 
   It is also important to note that even in cases where a tenant pays the rent that is due after filing for bankruptcy, my amendment leaves intact the current law that allows landlords to get relief from the automatic stay. Let me be very clear about that. My amendment does not eliminate the ability of landlords to apply for relief from the stay under current law. The law now gives debtors some breathing room in legal proceedings, including eviction proceedings. But landlords can apply for relief from the stay. It is not an abuse of the law to take advantage of the automatic stay to get your affairs in order. Many tenants use that time to work out a payment schedule for their back rent so they can avoid eviction altogether. 
   Most landlords don't want to throw people out on the street--they just want to be paid. My amendment requires that they be paid once bankruptcy is filed, or the eviction can proceed immediately. But even if the rent is paid while the bankruptcy case is pending, a landlord can still seek relief from stay under the normal procedures and press forward with the eviction. 
   I have a letter from the National Association of Realtors, a powerful lobbying association, that is unalterably opposed to my amendment. This letter is dated January 24, 2000, several days ago. It urges opposition to my amendment, which it says will ``seriously weaken'' the bill. But listen to what it says about the bill. The letter says that current law allows for ``serious fraud and abuse.'' But my amendment deals with the cases of fraud and abuse by disallowing the automatic stay in the case of repeat filings. And the Realtor's letter says that current law allows tenant to ``live rent free at the expense of the property owner.'' But my amendment does not allow tenants to live rent free. They have to pay rent once the bankruptcy is filed. And it says that prospective tenants often ``have to wait 6 months or longer, as they do now, to get into rental property units occupied by residents overstaying their lease.'' Well that is simply not true under my amendment. This amendment allows for expedited relief from stay in any case where the lease has expired according to its terms and the landlord has entered into a valid rental agreement with another tenant prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. 
   Every single one of the arguments made by the National Association of Realtors against the amendment is refuted by the amendment itself, every one. Yet this group persists in urging the Senate to reject the amendment. It says, speaking about the provisions of the bill that the amendment will modify: ``we believe these common sense provisions will curb abusive use of the Bankruptcy Code.'' If the Realtors were honest, they would admit that my amendment will do exactly the same thing. It will curb abusive use of the Bankruptcy Code. But it will also continue to allow the code to provide protection to people who are not abusing the system, but simply using it to get back on their feet, and keep a roof over their heads. Those people would be treated too harshly by the current bill, and it is unfortunate that the Realtors, in their zeal to get as many advantages for landlords as they can, refuse to see that. 
   I have modified this amendment in the spirit of compromise to address all of the concerns that the Senator from Alabama raised in debate last year. This amendment addresses the abuse, it is fair to landlords and makes sure they are not economically harmed when a tenant files for bankruptcy, and it is fair to debtors who file for bankruptcy in good faith and simply need a little breathing space to get their lives in order. 
   I urge my colleagues to look carefully at this amendment, and I hope they will support it. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose the Levin-Durbin amendment, which would make certain judgments against gun manufacturers nondischargeable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. I appreciate the sincere views of my friends from Michigan and Illinois who have proposed this amendment as a way to highlight the serious issues of gun violence in this country. I do not believe, however, that this amendment is necessary, and I think it has the potential to set a dangerous precedent in our business bankruptcy system. 
   First, there is a real question of whether this amendment is necessary. Chapter 11 business bankruptcy is not like Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy where debts are simply wiped out by the bankruptcy decree. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a business's reorganization plan must receive the approval of the court and of the other creditors. It is far from clear that the kind of judgments that are at issue in the Levin amendment will automatically be discharged in a bankruptcy reorganization.  
   In addition, Chapter 11 bankruptcy often provides a useful forum for making sure that all claimants against a company are treated fairly. We have seen that happen with respect to suits against asbestos and IUD manufacturers. Without it, plaintiffs may end up in a race to the courthouse to try to claim the limited assets of a company. 
   Because I have some doubt that the amendment is necessary, and whether it is advisable even from the point of view of potential plaintiffs against gun manufacturers, I am reluctant to set the precedent of using the business bankruptcy system in this way. I believe this amendment is different from some of the non-dischargeability provisions already applicable to personal bankruptcies or that will be voted on here before we complete this bill. Whereas we can say to someone who is contemplating personal bankruptcy that it is our judgment that certain debts simply should not be discharged because of the circumstances or culpability that led to the bankruptcy in the first place, it is hard to see how delivering that message in this particular narrow business bankruptcy context accomplishes the same goal. I will therefore vote against this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. I wish to respond briefly to the short remarks the Senator from Alabama made with regard to the landlord-tenant amendment. 
   I want to reiterate, as the Senator from Alabama acknowledged, that he raised a whole series of concerns out here on the floor in the course of our debate on the amendment a few months ago. And he does not dispute that we addressed every single one of those concerns, as we modified the amendment. We have been very attentive to the fact there were aspects of the amendment that made the Senator, and others, uncomfortable. We made changes in the spirit of compromise in order to try to get something done. 
   By eliminating the automatic stay, section 311 of this bill is an enormous change in the law in favor of landlords. What the Senator does not make clear is that we are not undoing that change with this amendment. What our amendment does is streamline the process for lifting the automatic stay, rather than eliminating the stay altogether. So instead of a 6- or 8-week period, or longer, to get the stay lifted,  our amendment provides a 15-day period, and the State eviction proceedings go forward. But those proceedings cannot go forward when the tenant is paying rent. 
   All we are saying is that if a person is truly trying to get his or her act together, and is willing, from the time of the bankruptcy filing forward, to pay rent every month, on time, then in those cases the stay should be in place. I think that is enormously reasonable. 
   For the Senator to suggest this is somehow federalizing this area is the opposite of what is going on. In fact, this bill, as it will undoubtedly pass, will remove Federal court, in effect, in an awful lot of cases that currently are protected by Federal bankruptcy proceedings because of the automatic stay. And so will our amendment. If a tenant misses a rent payment, or is damaging the apartment, all the landlord has to do is file a simple one page certification to that effect with the bankruptcy court and the stay is lifted. 
   All we are saying is, in some cases there still needs to be that stay in place where someone is honestly trying to stay in that apartment, someone is truly trying to get their life together, and is willing to make the rent payments. 
   So it is simply incorrect to say this is going to gut the provision in the bill. Our amendment still is a dramatic change from current law. It is a change that is very pro-landlord. All we are saying is, let's be fair. 
   It is not accurate when the Senator from Alabama says there is automatically going to be a hearing at the end of the 15 days. That is not the case. Yes, it is conceivable that tenants could come and seek a hearing if they claimed that the landlord's certification was inadequate or mistaken, but there is no automatic right to a hearing. If those 15 days lapse, that is it. The State eviction proceeding goes ahead, the automatic stay is lifted. 
   In summary, I think this is a classic case of where, instead of there being a fundamental disagreement that we cannot bridge, we tried very hard to add a few elements of fairness to the bill. I think the Senator from Alabama would have to concede we did do that. It would be appropriate for Members to take a good look at this modified amendment and adopt it to make sure we do not have an unduly harsh change in the law. I cannot believe even the harshest landlord would want to have some of the consequences that could result if we do not adopt the reasonable modifications contained in this amendment. 
   Mr. President, with that, I ask, how much time is remaining?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, current law provides for an automatic stay of eviction proceedings upon the filing of a bankruptcy case. Landlords can apply for relief from that stay so eviction can proceed, but under current law the process often takes several months. Section 311 of the bill eliminates the stay in all landlord-tenant cases so eviction can proceed immediately. 
   My amendment would allow tenants to remain in their apartments as they try to sort out the difficult consequences of bankruptcy, if and only if they are willing to pay the rent that comes due after they file for bankruptcy. If the tenant fails to pay the rent, the stay can be lifted 15 days after the landlord provides notice to the court that the rent has not been paid. So no hearing and no delay. If the reason for the eviction is drug use or property damage, the stay can also be lifted after 15 days. Under the amendment, this 15-day notice period does not apply if the tenant has filed for bankruptcy previously. In other words, in the case of repeat filings, the automatic stay would never take effect, just as under section 311 in the bill. 
   Under my amendment, therefore, you could never live rent free as some of the opponents suggest. The debtor has to pay rent after filing for bankruptcy. If a debtor misses a rent payment, the stay will be lifted after 15 days. So the amendment gets at the abuse and it protects the rights and economic interests of the landlord. What it does eliminate is the punitive aspect of the bill. We have modified this so it is fair. The major reform in favor of landlords still holds, but there has to be some fairness and balance with regard to the effect of the bill on evictions. That is what I am trying to protect through this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In that  devastated country, we see one of the worst international crises of the last decade. It is a bloody and brutal conflict, one that has drawn country after country into an un-winnable struggle, one that has cost the lives of thousands of civilians and has displaced hundreds of thousands more, and one about which this body has been strangely quiet. 
   Congo's conflict is as complex as it is destructive. It is born of the long absence of any semblance of political legitimacy in the government of that battered state, it is fed by the horrifying legacy of the Rwandan genocide, and it is intensified by the constant struggle for resources and wealth in the region. The litany of the causes of the war in Congo is a catalogue of the problems that plague the heart of Africa. Its outcome will likely determine the course of the region's future. 
   Mr. President, we need to wake up and realize that the U.S. has a stake in that future. Our interests in global peace and stability, the rule of law, and respect for basic human rights are bound up in Congo's future. Africans and their potential American trading partners can have no hope of realizing Africa's vast economic potential until the region's cycles of violence come to an end. And America urgently needs to stop the spread of infectious disease, to address environmental degradation, and to build a global coalition to fight international crime--but these needs cannot be met without stability in central Africa. 
   And Mr. President, global forces of instability will thrive, and their insidious influence will grow, when parties to the conflict in Congo turn to them, in desperation, for support. 
   Mr. President, central Africa's leaders know that the region cannot prosper while the war in the D.R.C. continues. For that reason, last summer the parties to the conflict signed a blueprint for ending the conflict--the Lusaka Agreement. That Agreement calls for an end to the fighting, for a free political dialogue within Congo, and lays out the path to the withdrawal of foreign forces. 
   Mr. President, I traveled to many of the countries involved in the crisis at the end of last year. In Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, in Uganda and Rwanda, and in the D.R.C. itself, I personally heard heads of state acknowledge the importance of making the Lusaka Agreement work. They understand the challenge before them, the precious opportunity embodied by Lusaka. 
   Last week the parties to the Congo conflict renewed their commitment to the Lusaka Agreement in a series of extraordinary meetings at the United Nations in New York. They have all agreed to a facilitator, former President Masire of Botswana, to move the inter-Congolese dialogue forward. And all parties have called for a strengthening of the Joint Military Commission that is at the heart of the framework for peace. 
   Mr. President, just as the U.S. has a stake in the outcome, the United States also has a role to play in supporting these efforts. The U.N. has already deployed a small team of liaison officers to the scene. Now, the United Nations Secretary General has issued a report laying out the next phase of U.N. involvement. It calls for the deployment of 500 monitors, with a 5,000-strong force providing security and logistical support to their mission. They will have a robust mandate that ensures their ability to protect themselves. 
   Mr. President, none of the troops would be American, and that is as it should be. In fact, in my meetings with heads of state in the region, I explicitly asked about their expectations with regard to American troops, and I can report that no one has visions of a large American presence on the ground in Congo. But by creating the breathing room necessary to allow the belligerents to move toward peace, these troops will serve American interests.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. I intend to withdraw this amendment after I and other Senators interested in the amendment have had a chance to talk within the 30-minute period. 
   As I said late last year, this amendment is considerably different from my original bill, S. 1568, the East Timor Self-Determination Act. I made significant alterations to it in order to respond to changing events and the concerns of other Senators and the administration. 
   My amendment would have suspended all military and security assistance to Indonesia until clear steps had been taken to stop the harassment of East Timorese refugees, to end the collusion between violent militia groups and the Indonesian military, and to hold those responsible for recent atrocities accountable for their actions. 
   My amendment would have put this body on the record in recognition of the need to use United States military and security assistance responsibly in Indonesia.  
   My original bill, which passed the Foreign Relations Committee on September 27 by an overwhelming vote of 17-1, was introduced in the wake of the violence that erupted after the results of East Timor's historic referendum were announced on September 4. It was cosponsored by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, as well as many other Members of the Senate. 
   I took that action, in cooperation with my colleagues, because events in East and West Timor demanded it. 
   While I am very pleased to have the opportunity to finally call up my legislation on the Senate floor, it is unfortunate that this is being squeezed in to a debate on the bankruptcy bill rather than standing alone. It is unfortunate that we are here debating this amendment more than 4 months after the events in East Timor that gave rise to it. It is unfortunate and it is inappropriate, because the events in East Timor that originally cried out for this legislation are deadly serious. And the encouraging events that justified changes in the legislation are critically important. Both deserved thoughtful consideration from the Senate. 
   On August 30, well over 99 percent of registered voters in East Timor courageously came to the polls to express their will regarding the political status of that territory. 
   More than 78 percent of those voters marked their ballot in favor of independence. 
   But weeks of violence dampened the jubilation that immediately followed the vote, as the Indonesian military--a military that the United States has long supported--colluded with militia groups in waging a scorched earth campaign throughout the territory. 
   Thousands of people were forced to leave, and many were killed. 
   But for the East Timorese run out of their homes in the fray, the nightmare did not end there. 
   Just days ago, the Independent newspapers of London reported on the horrible conditions in the remaining refugee camps in West Timor. In one part of West Timor, UNICEF has found that 25 percent of refugee children are malnourished. 
   To this day, militia members harass and intimidate East Timorese in West Timor's refugee camps. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, between 100,000 and 150,000 refugees remain, in many cases against their will, in the refugee camps. 
   But some will say that we should remain silent on these matters, and continue to let events in Timor and Indonesia unfold without comment. Some will say that the time for action has passed. They will point to the recent democratic elections in Indonesia, and to the Indonesian government's stated willingness to accept the results of the August 30 ballot. They will note the many encouraging steps that President Wahid has taken in the direction of reform. And they will point to President Wahid's most recent, public commitment to holding military officers accountable for their actions--actions now described in both Indonesian and U.N. investigations. 
   They are right to emphasize the positive signals coming from the new government, and they are right to point out that the situation in Indonesia has changed significantly in the past four months. I recognize those changes, and I have tried to respond to them as my legislation has wended its way through this body. 
   Make no mistake--the Indonesians were aware of the original legislation. And over the last few months they have undoubtedly taken note of the changes that were made in this amendment--changes that sent a clear signal that the United States recognizes that the government of Indonesia is moving toward democracy and accountability, and we are very interested in partnership with that kind of Indonesia. 
   While I support the notion that now is an important time to reach out toward the new government in Jakarta, I reject the idea that we should no longer maintain intense pressure on the Indonesian military. 
   Whether or not the Indonesian military is committed to serving under the new, promising, democratically-elected regime remains to be seen. Recently, rumors of coup plots and a possible military takeover of this fledgling democracy circulated in Jakarta and abroad. In recent months, ethnic and religious violence erupted in Aceh, the Spice Islands, and elsewhere in Indonesia. Many reports indicate that elements of the Indonesian military continue to stand by and do nothing to help the people they are supposed to protect. 
   So as we extend a welcome to Indonesia's new government, we must send a strong message about the kind of behavior that we do not welcome, and about the kinds of abuses that we will not ignore. It remains as crucially important today as it ever was to pressure violent elements in Indonesia to do the right thing. And I serve notice to my colleagues and to the administration--I stand ready to do just that. If U.S. policy fails to send a strong message in favor of reform and accountability, I will seize any legislative opportunity necessary to fight for a responsible policy--one that serves United States and Indonesian interests in stability and justice. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we would like an opportunity to briefly respond to the comments of the Senator from Missouri. I could have sworn the Senator had not heard my remarks earlier because his remarks suggest an analysis that has something to do with their original legislation. I took great pains throughout my comments to indicate exactly what the Senator from Missouri was indicating, that there are some very positive developments in Indonesia, and in particular that Government there, the democratically elected Government, is struggling to keep that nation strong, to keep that nation together, and to get control over the military. 
   So I find it very ironic that the Senator would come down here and say we need to be fair to that Government when you look at the comments in the last 48 hours. What has happened in the last 48 hours? President Wahid of Indonesia said, I say to the Senator from Missouri, that it may be necessary for Mr. Wiranto to resign. That is what the democratically elected President of Indonesia said when he heard about the investigations and reports of the United Nations. 
   What did Mr. Wiranto say with regard to that suggestion of the President of Indonesia? He said he was going to brush aside calls to resign from government and stand trial for his alleged role in human rights abuses in East Timor last year. ``Like a good soldier, I am going to continue to fight for the truth.'' 
   In other words, the Senator from Missouri asks us to support the President and the nation of Indonesia. But instead what he is really doing is giving support and sanction to the attitude of Mr. Wiranto, the person who many believe had a great deal to do with the atrocities in East Timor. 
   I did not come today to actually seek a vote on this amendment. I did indicate I would withdraw the amendment from this bankruptcy bill. We wanted to serve notice that we will continue to monitor this situation, and we are doing it in a balanced way that indicates our support for the positive developments in Indonesia. 
   The Senator from Missouri complains that our resolution is mostly negative with regard to things that happened in East Timor and with regard to Indonesia. This resolution is not about Indonesia in general. If the Senator wants to promote a resolution praising Indonesia and the positive things that have happened in Indonesia in the last couple of months, I may well join him. But this is about what happened in East Timor. 
   The Senator apparently took a trip recently to Indonesia, but the people who were on the floor to talk today--Senator REED and Senator HARKIN--  have actually been to East Timor. You can add to that a key person of the Clinton administration he kept mentioning, our distinguished Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, who also went to East Timor in late November and came back and told me and others that the conditions and circumstances with regard to the refugees in West Timor, many of whom want to get home to East Timor, are not good. He has a long and distinguished record of seeing these kinds of situations throughout the world in the over 30 or 40 years he has been in diplomacy. He was deeply troubled by the fact the job was not done. 
   The people of East Timor and the people of East Timor who are in West Timor and want to come home have not had their rights fully protected. That is why we are trying to put pressure on the military in Indonesia. That is not an unfriendly act to the Government of Indonesia. That is a friendly act because that is the toughest challenge the President of Indonesia has right now--making sure the military accepts democratic rule of that country. We are in an effort to support democracy in Indonesia, and it cannot go forward as the kind of democracy we support unless this situation in East Timor is properly resolved. That is the spirit of our amendment, and that is the spirit of our bill. I appreciate the additional time. 
   Let me add, Senator LEAHY is another who has done an enormous amount on this issue of East Timor and can certainly tell you the job is not done with regard to using our leverage and our ability to persuade and make sure the people of East Timor have full independence and that the people who want to return to East Timor have the opportunity to do that.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, earlier today, Governor George Ryan of Illinois made an announcement that is absolutely unprecedented for a sitting governor since the reinstatement of the modern death penalty almost 25 years ago. Governor Ryan plans to effectively block executions in Illinois by granting stays of all scheduled executions on a case-by-case basis until a State panel can examine whether Illinois is administering the death penalty fairly and justly. Governor Ryan is right to take this step, because real questions are being raised about whether innocent people are being condemned to die. 
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 Gregg decision finding the death penalty constitutional, Illinois has executed 12 people and and found 13 people on death row to be innocent. This is truly extraordinary. After condemning people to death, Illinois has actually found more death row inmates innocent than it has executed! Some of the innocent were exonerated based on a new DNA test of forensic evidence. Others successfully challenged their convictions based on inadequate representation by disbarred or suspended attorneys or a determination that crucial testimony of a jailhouse informant was unreliable. Illinois has exonerated 13 individuals but the numbers are sure to grow, as other cases continue to be investigated and appeals make their way through the courts. 
   What is even more troubling is that the lives of some of these 13 innocent people were saved not by the diligence of defense counsel or a jury or judge, but by a group of students taking a journalism class at Northwestern University. These Northwestern University students uncovered evidence, which led to the exoneration of people like Anthony Porter, who spent 15 years on death row and came within 2 days of execution. The criminal justice system failed to do its job. These students and their journalism professor--actors very much outside the criminal justice system--did the footwork to uncover exculpatory evidence. Governor Ryan supports the death penalty as a form of punishment in Illinois. I do not. But he has courageously acknowledged what many lawyers, scholars, and journalists have argued for some time: the criminal justice system in Illinois is broken and it must be fixed. 
   I applaud Governor Ryan for what is unfortunately unusual courage. Many political leaders, even those who may be personally opposed to the death penalty, nevertheless feel it is somehow ``political suicide'' to support a moratorium on executions. They fear being  labeled ``soft on crime.'' But, last year, the Nebraska legislature passed a moratorium initiative, unfortunately, it was only to be vetoed later by the governor. But Governor Ryan--a Republican Governor and the Illinois chair of Republican Presidential hopeful George W. Bush's campaign--has decided he will lead the people of Illinois to expecting more from their criminal justice system. He has decided to hold out for what should be the minimum standard of any system of justice: that we do all that we can not to execute an innocent person. 
   As a result of the Governor's action, Illinois is the first of the 38 States with the death penalty to halt all executions while it reviews the death penalty procedure. But the problems of inadequate representation, lack of access to DNA testing, police misconduct, racial bias and even simple errors are not unique to Illinois. These are problems that have plagued the administration of capital punishment around the country since the reinstatement of capital punishment almost a quarter century ago. I hope the Federal government and the other 37 States with capital punishment follow the wisdom of Illinois and halt executions until they, too, review their administration of the death penalty. At the Federal level, I call on the President and the Attorney General to suspend executions until the Federal government reviews the administration of the Federal death penalty. 
   Are we certain that the Federal death penalty is being applied in a fair, just and unbiased manner? Are we certain that the Federal death penalty is sought against defendants free of even a hint of racial bias? Are we certain that the Federal death penalty is sought evenly from U.S. Attorney district to U.S. Attorney district across the Nation? I don't think we have a clear answer to these questions. Yet, these are questions, literally, of life or death. 
   There isn't room for even a simple mistake when it comes to the ultimate punishment, the death penalty. For a nation that holds itself to principles of justice, equality and due process, the Federal government should not be in the business of punishing by killing. As Governor Ryan's spokesperson aptly noted, ``It's really not about politics. How could anyone be opposed to this when the system is so clearly flawed?'' 
   Let us not let one more innocent person be condemned to die. Let us demand reform. 
   In a moment, I intend to offer an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to the bankruptcy reform bill that will protect and preserve the American consumers' right to take their disputes with creditors to court. There is a troubling trend among credit card companies and consumer credit lenders of requiring customers to use binding arbitration when a dispute arises. Under this system, the consumer is barred from taking a dispute to court, even a small claims court. 
   While arbitration can certainly be an efficient tool to settle claims, it is credible and effective only when customers and consumers enter into it knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening in the credit card and consumer credit lending business. One of the most fundamental principles of our civil justice system is each American's right to take a dispute to court. In fact, each of us has a right in civil and criminal cases to a trial by jury. A right to a jury trial in criminal cases is contained in the sixth amendment to the Constitution. The right to a jury trial in a civil case is contained in the seventh amendment, which provides, ``In suits at common law where the value and controversy shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.'' 
   It has been argued that Americans are overusing the courts. Court dockets across the country are said to be congested with civil cases. In response to these concerns, various ways to resolve disputes, other than taking a dispute to court, have been developed. Alternatives to litigating in a court of law are collectively known as ``alternative dispute resolution,'' or ADR. Alternative dispute resolution includes mediation and arbitration. Mediation and arbitration can resolve disputes in an efficient manner because the parties can have their cases heard well before they would have received a trial date in a court. Mediation is conducted by a neutral third party, the mediator, who meets with the opposing parties to help them find a mutually satisfactory solution. Unlike a judge in a courtroom, the mediator has no independent power to impose a solution. No formal rules of evidence or procedure control mediation. The mediator and the parties mutually agree on how to proceed. 
   In contrast, arbitration involves one or more third parties--an arbitrator or arbitration panel. Unlike mediation but similar to a court proceeding, the arbitrator issues a decision after reviewing the merits of the case as presented by all parties. Arbitration uses rules of evidence and procedure, although it may use rules that are simpler or more flexible than the evidentiary and procedural rules that a party would follow or be subjected to in a court proceeding. And arbitration can be either binding or nonbinding. 
   Nonbinding arbitration means the decision issued by the arbitrator or arbitration panel takes effect only if the parties agree to it after they know what the decision is. 
   In binding arbitration, parties agree in advance to accept and abide by the decision, whatever it is. In addition, there is a practice of inserting arbitration clauses in contracts to require arbitration as the forum to resolve disputes before a dispute has even arisen. 
   Now, this is called mandatory arbitration. This means that if there is a dispute, the complaining party cannot file suit in court, and instead is required to pursue arbitration. It is binding, mandatory arbitration, and it therefore means that under the contract the parties must use arbitration  to resolve a future disagreement, and the decision of the arbitration panel is final. The parties have no ability to seek relief in court or through mediation. In fact, if they are not satisfied with the arbitration outcome, they are probably stuck with the decision. Even if a party believes the arbitrator did not consider all the facts or follow the law, the party cannot file a lawsuit in court. A basis to challenge a binding arbitration decision exists only where there is reason to believe the arbitrator committed actual fraud, which is a pretty unlikely scenario. 
   In contrast, if a dispute is resolved by a court, the parties can potentially pursue an appeal of the lower court's decision. 
   Madam President, because binding mandatory arbitration is so conclusive, this form of arbitration can be a credible means of dispute resolution only when all parties know and understand the full ramifications of agreeing to it. I am afraid that is not what is happening in our Nation's business climate and economy in a variety of contexts ranging from motor vehicle franchise agreements, to employment agreements, to credit card agreements. I am proud to have sponsored legislation addressing employment agreements and motor vehicle franchise agreements. In fact, I am the original cosponsor, with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, the manager of the bankruptcy reform bill, of S. 1020, which would prohibit the unilateral imposition of binding, mandatory arbitration in motor vehicle dealership agreements with manufacturers. 
   Many of our colleagues have joined us as cosponsors. 
   Similar to the problem in the motor vehicle dealership context, there is a growing, menacing trend of credit card companies and consumer credit lenders inserting binding, mandatory arbitration clauses in agreements with consumers. Companies such as First USA Bank, American Express, and Green Tree Discount Company unilaterally insert binding mandatory arbitration clauses in their agreements with consumers, often without the consumers' knowledge or consent. 
   The most common way the credit card companies have done so is often through the use of a ``bill stuffer.'' Bill stuffers are the advertisements and other materials that credit card companies insert in envelopes with the customers' monthly statements. Some credit card issuers such as American Express have placed fine-print, mandatory arbitration clauses on bill stuffers. Let's take a look at what I am talking about. 
   I have in my hand a monthly statement mailing from American Express. Let's look inside. 
   First, we have the return envelope to pay your bill. And look at what is on the envelope. They have attached an advertisement. 
   So before you can mail your payment, you have to tear this advertisement off the back of the envelope. Otherwise you won't be able to seal it shut. 
   Then, if you look at what else is in the envelope, here is the monthly statement. It is a multipage printed form, front and back. 
   On this occasion, even though there was very little activity on this particular account--one charge and one credit--the statement is six pages long. The first page contains information about how much you owe American Express, charges made, payments received, finance charges applied, and so on. The reverse side of the first page also contains some fine print information about the account. 
   Then, if you look at pages 3 and 4 they contain additional fine-print information about the account; for example, what to do if your card is stolen or lost, and a summary of your billing rights. 
   If you keep reading at this point, you look at pages 5 and 6. They are chock full of advertising material. Target stores urge you to shop with them. The State of North Carolina encourages you to plan your next holiday in North Carolina. 
   This past spring, in addition to an American Express cardholder being bombarded with all of this information, American Express cardholders also received this--For Your Information, ``FYI, A Summary of Changes to Agreements and Benefits.'' The summary is 10 pages long. 
   In addition to the multipage statement of charges, terms, and advertising material, the cardholder received another multipage document with fine-print terms and conditions. 
   If my colleagues are like me and most Americans, I review the statement of charges for accuracy, look at how much I owe, rip off the bottom portion, stick it and my check in the return envelope, and mail it to American Express. I don't spend a lot of time reading all of the fine-print information about the account or the ad. I certainly would not spend time reading a 10-page summary of changes to my statement. At most, I might scan these other pages and bill stuffers, but I would not spend time reading them in detail. 
   Let's look at the summary of changes. As I said, it is called, ``FYI, A Summary of Changes to Agreements and Benefits.'' When you look at their summary, there are two things that hit you: The cartoon in the middle and the big letters, ``FYI'' in the upper left side of the first page. FYI, for your information, to me and most Americans means that it contains some information that may be of interest to me but nothing that requires serious thought or action from me. In reality, however, the summary of changes is a 
   complex, fine-print document that almost reads like a legal document. It talks about changes to various privileges of the American Express card membership, American Express Purchase Protection Plan, Buyer's Assurance Plan, Car Rental Loss and Damage Insurance Plan, and Credit Protection Plan. 
   In addition, the summary contains an arbitration provision on page 2. Even though the document contains changes to the terms of the agreement with the cardholder--it actually changes the contract between the parties--it is simply labeled as an FYI, for your information, document. I find that troubling. 
   If we take a closer look at the arbitration provision, this arbitration provision is in condensed, fine print, to say the least. It is not exactly easy to read, even though this is an enlarged version of the original. The key clause in this arbitration provision is the following:  
   If arbitration is chosen by any party with respect to a claim, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim.  
   I will repeat that. 
   If the cardholder has a dispute with American Express, the cardholder cannot take the claim to court or have a jury trial on the claim. This provision took effect on June 1 of last year. So if you are an American Express cardholder and you have a dispute with American Express, as of June 1999, you can't take your claim to court--even small claims court. You are bound to use arbitration, and you are bound to live with the final arbitration decision. 
   In this case, you are also bound to use an arbitration organization selected by American Express, the National Arbitration Forum. 
   Unfortunately, American Express isn't the only credit card company imposing mandatory arbitration on its customers. First USA Bank, the largest issuer of Visa cards, with 58 million customers, has been doing the same thing since 1997. 
   Here is the bill stuffer distributed by First USA. This is the inside of a folded, one-page insert. As you can see, similar to the American Express summary, this is another fine-print, condensed set of terms and conditions. It covers a wide variety of topics, including information on finance charges, termination and foreign currency transactions. Here in the last column are the three paragraphs on the arbitration provision. The language is similar to the American Express language and states that the cardholders' dispute will be resolved by arbitration. The cardholder will not be able to go to a court to resolve the claim. No ``if's,'' ``and's,'' or ``but's'' about it. Just plain and simple. The cardholder, by virtue of continuing to simply use the First USA card, gives up the right to go to court, even small claims court, to resolve the dispute. 
   Unfortunately, this problem also extends beyond credit cards. It is also a growing practice in the consumer loan industry. Consumer credit lenders such as Green Tree Consumer Discount  Company are inserting mandatory arbitration clauses in their loan agreement. The problem is these loan agreements are usually adhesion contracts, which means that the consumer must either sign the agreement as is or forego a loan. 
   In other words, the consumer lacks the bargaining power to have the clause removed. More importantly, when signing on the dotted line of the loan agreement, the consumer may not even understand what mandatory arbitration means. The consumer in all likelihood does not understand that he or she has written away his or her right to go to court to resolve a dispute with the lender. 
   Arbitration in some ways, of course, is an efficient way to settle disputes. But it has to be entered into knowingly and voluntarily. That is not what is happening in either the consumer loan or credit card industries. 
   You might say that if consumers are not pleased with being subjected to a mandatory arbitration clause, consumers can cancel their credit card, or not execute on their loan agreement, and they can take their business elsewhere. Unfortunately, that is easier said than done. As I mentioned, First USA Bank, the Nation's largest Visa card issuer, is part of this questionable practice. In fact, the practice is becoming so pervasive that consumers may soon no longer have an alternative unless they forego use of a credit card or a consumer loan entirely. I think that is kind of a hefty price to pay to retain the longstanding right to go to court. 
   In my opinion, this is a decision that consumers should not be forced to make. Companies such as First USA, American Express, and Green Tree argue that they rely on mandatory arbitration to resolve disputes faster and cheaper than court litigation. The claim may be resolved faster, but is it really cheaper? Is it as fair as a court of law? I don't think so. 
   Arbitration organizations can charge exorbitant fees to the consumer who brings a dispute--often an initial filing fee plus hourly fees to the arbitrator or arbitrators involved in the case. These costs to consumers can be higher than bringing the matter to small claims court and paying a court filing fee. 
   For example, the National Arbitration Forum, the arbitration entity of choice for American Express and First USA, the National Arbitration Forum charges fees that are likely greater than if the consumer brought a dispute in small claims court. For a claim of less than $1,000, the National Arbitration Forum charges the consumer a $49 filing fee. 
   In contrast, the consumer could have brought the same claim, in small claims court here in the District of Columbia and would have paid a fee of no more than $10. In other words, the consumer pays a fee to the National Arbitration Forum that is nearly five times more than the fee for filing a claim with small claims court. 
   That is bad enough, but the National Arbitration Forum's competitors are even worse. The American Arbitration Association charges a $500 filing fee for claims of less than $10,000, or more if the claim exceeds $10,000, and a minimum filing fee of $2,000 if the case involves three or more arbitrators. In addition to the filing fee, they also charge a hearing fee for holding hearings other than the initial hearing--$150 to be paid by each party for each day of hearings before a single arbitrator, for $250 if the hearing is held before an arbitration panel. The International Chamber of Commerce requires a $2,500 administrative fee plus an arbitrator's fee of at least $2,500, if the claim is less than $50,000. These fees are greater if the claim exceeds $50,000. This $5,000 or more fee could very well be greater than the consumer's entire claim. So, as you can see, the consumer's dispute is not resolved more efficiently with arbitration. It is resolved either at greater cost to the consumer or not at all, if the consumer cannot afford the costs, or the costs outweigh the amount in dispute. 
   The unilateral imposition of mandatory arbitration also raises fairness concerns. As I demonstrated earlier, typical cardholders are not likely to ever notice the arbitration provision. But even if they notice the provision and read the fine print, consumers nevertheless may not understand that their right to court has just been stripped away. So, what we have here is a small number of people 
   who will actually read the bill stuffer and an even smaller number who will understand what it means. 
   Another problem with mandatory, binding arbitration is that the lender gets to decide in advance who the arbitrator will be. In the case of American Express and First USA, they have chosen the National Arbitration Forum. All credit card disputes with consumers involving American Express or First USA are handled by them. What does this mean? If you think about it, the arbitrator has a financial interest in reaching an outcome that favors the credit card company. If the National Arbitration Forum develops a pattern of reaching decisions that favor the cardholder, wouldn't American Express or First USA strongly consider taking their arbitration business elsewhere? I think there is a very good chance, I would say there is a significant chance that would happen. 
   There has been one important ruling on the enforceability of mandatory arbitration provisions in credit card agreements. That ruling involved a mandatory arbitration provision announced in mailings to Bank of America credit card and deposit account holders. In a 1998 decision by the California Court of Appeals, which the California Supreme Court refused to review, the court ruled that the mandatory arbitration clauses unilaterally imposed on the Bank's customers were invalid and unenforceable. As a result of that decision, credit card companies in California cannot impose mandatory arbitration in their disputes with customers. In fact, the American Express notice recognizes this fact and notes here at the bottom that the provision will not apply to California residents until further notice from the company. I think that was a wise, well-reasoned decision by the California appellate court, but Americans have no assurance that all courts will reach the same fair and reasonable decision. 
   My amendment extends the wisdom of the California appellate decision to every credit cardholder and consumer loan borrower in the country. It amends the Federal Arbitration Act to prohibit the unilateral imposition of mandatory, binding arbitration in consumer credit transactions. 
   Let me be clear. I believe that arbitration can be an efficient way to settle disputes. I agree we ought to encourage alternative dispute resolution. But I also believe that arbitration is a fair way to settle disputes only when it is entered into knowingly and voluntarily by both parties to the dispute. My amendment does not prohibit arbitration of consumer credit transactions when entered into voluntarily and knowingly. It merely prohibits binding, mandatory arbitration imposed unilaterally without the consumer's knowledgeable and/or voluntary consent. 
   Credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly slamming the courthouse doors shut on consumers, often unbeknownst to them. This is grossly unjust. Let's restore fairness to the resolution of consumer credit disputes. 
   At some point I hope that my colleagues will join me in keeping the doors to the courthouse open to all American credit card users and consumer credit borrowers. At this time, however, I will not push for a vote on this issue. I have agreed to withdraw this amendment with the understanding from my friend from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, the manager of this bill and the chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, that the issue of mandatory arbitration in consumer credit agreements will be part of a hearing to be held in the Courts Subcommittee on March 1. That hearing will address the Federal Arbitration Act and the problem of mandatory arbitration clauses inserted in contracts unilaterally. I appreciate Senator GRASSLEY's leadership and cooperation in reaching this accommodation. I look forward to working with him on this issue, as well as the broader issue of the growing, problematic trend of the unilateral imposition of mandatory arbitration in a variety of contracts. 
   I admire the leadership of the Senator on the overall issue in addition to the fact it has come up and is a serious problem in the consumer credit agreement area. 
   Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, it is very much to my satisfaction. I am delighted to know we are going to look at a variety of contexts at this hearing, including this one with the credit card companies but also the one my colleague and I have had so much interest in regarding motor vehicles and also the employment discrimination area. To me, although I would be pleased to have this amendment on this bill, I think that is a good opportunity to point out the overall problem we have had, what my colleague described as the possibility arbitration would be used in a way that neither of us would like, that it would somehow become a method of unfairness instead of what we both hope, which is a way to resolve disputes more efficiently or economically, sometimes, than when you go to court. I think it is an excellent idea. 
   I look forward to working with the chairman in preparation for the hearing. I think it is a good way to work out all these issues, and, again, I thank the Senator from Iowa for being very easy to work with on this and being very serious about getting something done.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a titan in our nation's naval history. Early this year, during our recess, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr. passed away. Admiral Zumwalt led a disciplined, dedicated, and directed life and career as a leader and, sometimes, as an iconoclast. 
   Mr. President, Admiral Zumwalt's meteoric rise through the ranks began at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he graduated in just three years, yet ranked seventh in his class. Following his graduation from the academy, Zumwalt began a lengthy career on a number of surface warships. 
   Among those ships was the U.S.S. Wisconsin, one of four Iowa-class battleships, the largest battleships ever built by the Navy. The four vessels, the Wisconsin, the Iowa, the New Jersey and the Missouri, served gallantly in every significant United States conflict from World War II to the Persian Gulf War. Future Admiral Zumwalt, the Wisconsin's navigator when the Korean War broke out, extolled her ``versatility, maneuverability, strength, and power.'' Unbeknownst to him, this would not be the last time that he would leave his indelible mark on the great state of Wisconsin. 
   Following his service in the war, Zumwalt shuttled between the Pentagon and the sea. He excelled in both arenas, but in entirely different ways. 
   In 1970, President Nixon appointed Zumwalt the youngest Chief of Naval Operations in our history. As CNO, Admiral Zumwalt tackled some of the most divisive and challenging issues not just to hit the Navy, but society at large. And we're still trying to conquer some of them. 
   Admiral Zumwalt crusaded for a fair and equal Navy. He fought to promote equality for minorities and women at a time of considerable racial strife in our country and at a time of deeply entrenched institutional racism and sexism in the Navy. He pushed so hard against the establishment that he almost lost his job. But thanks to the support of some like-minded reformers, including our esteemed colleague, the late John Chafee, who was then the Secretary of the Navy, Zumwalt prevailed and instituted a host of personnel reforms. 
   Mr. President, Admiral Zumwalt's efforts to promote equality addressed, in part, an issue that we are tackling anew. Many in Congress and in the Defense Department seem to think that recruitment and retention can be improved simply by increasing pay and benefits. They could learn much from Admiral Zumwalt, who understood the importance not only of boosting pay, but also of changing the service to reflect the wants and needs of service members. 
   We should follow Admiral Zumwalt's example and take a broader view when we look to improve the lives of our military personnel. 
   Mr. President, in his later years, Admiral Zumwalt dedicated himself to assisting Vietnam War era veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange. He played an instrumental role in getting Agent Orange-exposed veterans with cancer a service-connected illness designation. I had the honor of meeting with him to discuss his efforts to increase research funding for Agent Orange related illnesses and to explore options for international cooperation in that research. 
   Admiral Elmo Zumwalt was a great naval leader, a visionary and a courageous challenger of the conventional wisdom. We will not see the likes of him again. We mourn his passing and salute his accomplishments.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this morning the Supreme Court issued the most significant ruling in the area of campaign finance and election law since the 1976 landmark decision in Buckley v. Valeo. I am happy to report the Court reaffirmed the core holding  of Buckley: The public's elected representatives have the constitutional power to limit contributions to political campaigns in order to protect the integrity of the political process from corruption or the appearance of corruption. 
   It is most fitting that this ruling came down this morning as the Senate prepares to return from its long recess. As you know, Mr. President, one of the most important unfinished pieces of business on our agenda is campaign finance reform and the McCain-Feingold bill. The House passed a reform bill last year by a wide bipartisan margin, and now today's Court decision leaves no doubt that a soft money ban, which is the core provision of that bill and of our bill in the Senate, is constitutional. Today's decision has dispatched one of the most persistent and most erroneous arguments against reform. The Court did it by a decisive vote of 6-3. We, as a legislative body, must step up and do what is right, what is constitutional, and what is demanded by the public and pass a ban on soft money. 
   I will take a minute to discuss this important Supreme Court decision and its implications for our work in this body. The case is Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC. It was an appeal of the decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that struck down contribution limits enacted by the Missouri Legislature to cover State elections. Those limits were modeled on the Federal limit--$1,000 per candidate per election in a statewide election, somewhat lower for candidates for the State legislature. The State statute includes an inflation adjustment so that the limit for statewide races had become $1,075 per election by the time this challenge was filed. 
   The Missouri limits were upheld by the district court, but they were struck down by the court of appeals. The court of appeals held that the State had not provided adequate evidence of actual or apparent corruption stemming from large contributions to justify the restrictions. It also suggested that the limits were too low and therefore unconstitutional because inflation has eroded the value of a $1,000 contribution since 1974, when the Congress chose that limit for Federal elections. 
   Today the Supreme Court squarely and decisively rejected the court of appeals analysis. It did so by a 6-3 vote. I might note that it did so by a 4-3 vote of Justices appointed by Republican Presidents. The Court held that there was more than adequate evidence of actual or apparent corruption on which the State legislature could base its judgment that contributions should be limited. The Court noted that the Buckley decision itself provides that evidence. It said:  
   Buckley demonstrates that the dangers of large, corporate contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are corrupt are neither novel nor implausible. The opinion noted that the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 election demonstrate that the problem of corruption is not an illusory one.  
   In essence, the Court today rejected the notion that legislatures must amass conclusive evidence of actual corruption in order to justify contribution limits and that each State or Federal legislature must reinvent the wheel each time it passes a new limit. The Court concluded:  
   [T]here is little reason to doubt that sometimes large contributions will work actual corruption of our political system, and no reason to question the existence of a corresponding suspicion among voters.  
   The Court thus found, as advocates for reform have argued for years, that it is reasonable for Congress to conclude that large contributions are corrupting our system. The question has been asked not too long ago in this Chamber, where is the corruption? Today Justice Souter has provided the answer: It is in the big money. 
   The Court also rejected the argument that because the passage of time has eroded the value of a $1,000 contribution, somehow that limit is now unconstitutionally low, even though it was acceptable in 1974. We have heard this argument time and again on the floor of the Senate. It has been rejected by the Supreme Court. The Court specifically held that Buckley did not establish a constitutional minimum. Instead, the relevant question in Buckley was ``whether the contribution limitation was so radical in effect as to render political association ineffective, drive the sound of a candidate's voice below the level of notice, and render contributions pointless.'' 
   The Court concluded:  
   Such being the test, the issue in later cases cannot be truncated to a narrow question about the power of the dollar but must go to the power to mount a campaign with all the dollars likely to be forthcoming. As Judge Gibson, the dissenting judge in the court of appeals, put it, ``the dictates of the first amendment are not mere functions of the Consumer Price Index.''  
   I have quoted the decision at some length because I think it is crucial that my colleagues hear and understand the very clear and very direct statements of the Supreme Court on 
   questions that were not only at issue in this case but that we have been debating in this body over the past few years. No longer can my colleagues come to this floor and say they would love to support a ban on soft money but it would violate the first amendment for Congress to outlaw unlimited corporate and labor contributions to political parties. This favorite figleaf clutched by opponents of reform was snatched away today by the Supreme Court. That emperor now has no clothes. 
   Just as 126 legal scholars said over 2 years ago when they wrote to us, today's decision confirms that Congress may constitutionally outlaw soft money in this country. Justice Breyer's concurrence today, joined by Justice Ginsburg, says that explicitly. He writes:  
   Buckley's holding seems to leave the political branches broad authority to enact laws regulating contributions that take the form of soft money.  
   We have more than adequate evidence of at least the appearance of corruption in these unlimited contributions. Furthermore, if Congress can limit individual contributions and ban corporate and labor contributions in connection with Federal elections, surely it can eliminate the soft money loophole through which corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals evade those limits. The constitutionality of the MCCAIN-FEINGOLD bill to ban soft money is simply no longer an open question. The support of the American people for taking such a step is not in doubt either. 
   What is in doubt is the courage and will of the Senate to do what has to be done. Now that we are back in session, and with the encouragement of the Supreme Court of the United States, we must act. The reason we must act was made very clear by the Supreme Court today. The survival of our democracy depends on our citizens having confidence that their elected officials will vote in accordance with the public interest rather than the interest of their contributors. The appearance of corruption inherent in unlimited contributions calls that confidence into grave question. As the Court said in its opinion today:  
   Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance. Democracy works only if people have faith in those who govern. That faith is bound to be shattered when high officials and their appointees engage in activities which arouse suspicions of ``malfeasance and corruption.''  
   I urge all of my colleagues to read and digest the opinion of the Court in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC. The Court has done its duty and spoken in a clear voice. Now we must do ours. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1999. I voted against this bill when it was brought to the floor last year as an amendment to an appropriations bill and again this year when it came through the Judiciary Committee. 
   I am pleased to see that Senator KYL was able to reach an agreement with Senator CAMPBELL and others to address Indian gaming issues. The bill's special treatment of certain forms of gambling was one of the reasons I voted against this bill when it was before the Judiciary Committee. It allowed state lotteries, fantasy sports leagues, and horse and dog track racing to continue to operate over the Internet, but prohibited use of the Internet for Indian gaming, which is expressly authorized by federal law. Under Senator CAMPBELL's amendment to S. 692, Indian gaming can continue to operate over the Internet under certain circumstances. 
   While I am glad to see the Indian gaming issue addressed, I nevertheless remain concerned with the fact that this bill singles out one emerging technology, the Internet, to try to attack the broad, complex social problems associated with gambling. The Internet is an evolving technology, and its full potential as a medium of expression has not been reached. While I share some of the concerns about the dangers of gambling that have inspired the sponsors of this legislation, I am reluctant to start down the path of restricting the use of the Internet for any particular lawful purpose. Once we have prohibited gambling on the Internet, what will be the next on-line activity that we will try  to ban? We need to be very careful not to create a precedent that might stifle the commercial and educational development of this very exciting technological tool with unhealthy implications for the First Amendment. I fear that this bill starts us down a road in that direction. 
   Mr. President, in light of the expressed sentiment of this body last year, I did not object to the unanimous consent request to pass this bill in the closing days of this session, but I would like the record to reflect my continuing opposition to this bill. 
   Thank you. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank all the people that have participated in the colloquy for their kind words about our effort and for coming to the floor to say it. My primary purpose in rising at this point is to praise my senior colleague, Senator KOHL. 
   The words that have been said about many in this effort are true. But I want everyone to know that this was not an effort that he initiated a week ago, or 2 weeks ago, or 2 years ago. Every single day since I have been in the Senate I have found working with Senator KOHL on this critical issue to be one of the best opportunities to work with another Senator together for our State. This has been certainly the most dramatic example. But it is an example also of the tenaciousness that Senator KOHL has on behalf of our dairy farmers. 
   Both he and I spent our entire youth in Wisconsin. He and I both know that in 1950 there were 150,000 dairy farms in this Wisconsin. Now there are less than 23,000. Over that time you begin to realize that some of the old dairy policies maybe once worked but now, frankly, are absurd. The notion of having this difference between the class I milk across the country based on issues that refrigeration and transportation that stopped existing decades ago makes no sense. The idea of a dairy cartel in one part of the country and a system that is supposed to be based on national economy and free enterprise is also ridiculous. 
   We know this Congress asked that the Department of Agriculture take a look at these issues, and said: What do you think we ought to do? They came back with a conclusion to narrow those differentials and get rid of the compact. Over 90 percent of the producers in the country said that is the right idea. That is why Senator KOHL and I fought so hard, because it wasn't just our idea. It wasn't just Wisconsin. It was a national consensus. 
   Unfortunately, I think this Congress has very inappropriately overturned that. And Senator KOHL and I will not give up until we have had the opportunity to reverse this unfortunate decision. 
   But I want to join with my senior colleague in thanking everyone for their courtesies on this. We obviously could have taken this to an even greater extent, and we realize the issues that are involved in that. This is a very important issue to not only Wisconsin, but to Minnesota, and to other States. We certainly will be back early next year to continue the battle. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to this legislation, which would revive an arcane  and unjust federal dairy policy that has destroyed thousands of family dairy farms. 
   Once again, the Senate is faced with dairy riders that fly in the face of recommendations from the Secretary of Agriculture, our nation's dairy farmers, and numerous taxpayer and consumer groups. It seems that political favors are more important to some in this Congress than policy decisions that help our nation's dairy farmers. 
   During the last four years neither of these two harmful provisions--Option 1A or the Northeast dairy compact--has won Senate approval. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: why must Senate and House leaders continue to play political games at the expense of our nation's dairy farmers? 
   Mr. President, these backdoor deals must stop. America's dairy farmers deserve a national dairy policy that ensures that all dairy farmers receive a fair price for their milk. 
   Unfortunately, the House and Senate leadership went into a back room, and snuck in these two riders that step up the attack on our dairy industry. 
   These decisions were separate even from the eyes and ears of members, and most members of the Senate Agriculture committee. With the proliferation of these backroom deals, it is no wonder that the general public is frustrated with Congress. 
   The simple fact is that neither of these two dairy riders has been approved by both chambers of Congress, or the President. 
   I would like to make my colleagues aware of the history behind these two provisions. During the last four years, the only Senate vote explicitly on the Northeast dairy compact resulted in a resounding rejection. 
   This year, the Senate again voted on a package containing the Northeast dairy compact, and it again failed to gain enough support to invoke cloture. 
   Mr. President, the House has yet to take a single vote specifically on the Northeast dairy compact. Compared to the record of the House, these two votes make the Senate look like experts on the Northeast dairy compact. 
   Furthermore, Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill required that the Northeast dairy compact expire upon implementation of USDA's reforms. Unfortunately these dairy riders seek to defy the will of Congress, and give the back of their hand to America's dairy farmers. 
   After tens of thousands of comments, USDA came up with a modest plan to reform our 30-year-old milk marketing order structure. 
   More than 59,000 dairy farmers from all over the United States participated in a USDA national referendum and 96% voted in favor of the United States Department of Agriculture's final rule to consolidate the current 31 federal milk marketing orders into 11, and to reform the price of Class I milk. 
   USDA's proposal garnered nearly uniform support in each of the 11 regions, including the Southeast, Midwest, and Northeast. 
   The second of these harmful dairy riders, would overturn these reforms. 
   Well, Mr. President, I take the floor today to deliver a simple message: Congress should not renew a milk marketing order system that devastates family farmers, and imposes higher costs on consumers and taxpayers. 
   There has been a great deal of confusion over the effects of these harmful dairy provisions. Some say that mandating Option 1A and a two year extension of the Northeast dairy compact simply preserves the status quo. 
   This legislation does much more than simply extend the 60-year milk marketing system. 
   A new forward contracting provision in this dairy rider enables processors to pay farmers much less than the federal blend price for their milk. 
   This forward contracting provision will also make the market less competitive for all other producers by reducing demand on the open market. Since it is likely that forward contracts would be offered to only the largest producers, this provision will result in losses to small and medium-sized producers, who will become residual suppliers. 
   Mr. President, these dairy provisions shift the attack on our nation's dairy farmers into overdrive. This harmful legislation will continue to push our nation's dairy farmers out of business, and off their land. 
   For sixty years, dairy farmers across America have been steadily driven out of business, and disadvantaged by the very Federal dairy policy this legislation seeks to revive. 
   In 1950, Wisconsin had over 143 thousand dairy farms. After nearly 50 years of the current dairy policy, Wisconsin is left with only 23 thousand farms. Let me repeat: 23 thousand farms. 
   Why would anyone seek to revive a dairy policy that has destroyed over 110 thousand dairy farms in a single state? That's more than five out of six farms in the last half-century. 
   This devastation has not been limited to Wisconsin. Since 1950, America has lost over three million dairy farms. And this trend is accelerating, since 1985, America has lost over half of its dairy producers. 
   Day after day, season after season, we are losing small farmers at an alarming rate. While these operations disappear, we are seeing the emergence of larger dairy farms. 
   The trend toward a few large dairy operations is mirrored in States throughout the nation. The economic losses associated with the reduction of small farms goes well beyond the impact on the individual farm families that have been forced off their land. 
   The loss of these farms has devastated rural communities where small family-owned dairy farms are the key to economic stability. 
   Option 1A also hurts these communities in other ways: through higher costs passed on to both consumers and taxpayers. 
   Option 1A would increase prices for milk and cheese in virtually every state in the country. Low income families and federal nutrition programs, which rely heavily on milk and cheese, will be seriously hurt by the price increases mandated by this legislation. 
   The poor and elderly will be especially burdened by higher costs. Under Option 1A and the Compact food stamp recipients would lose $40 million a year due to increases in beverage milk prices and another $18 million a year due to increased cheese prices. 
   This legislation also soaks taxpayers with a milk tax by imposing higher costs on every taxpayer because we all pay for nutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school 
   lunch program. 
   According to USDA, Option 1A alone would increase the average beverage milk price by nearly five cents a gallon and the cost of milk used for cheese by about two cents a gallon. 
   If we add up these costs to all of the federal nutrition programs, the costs mount up quickly. 
   Option 1A would cost the school lunch and school breakfast programs $19 million a year in higher beverage milk prices and cheese prices. 
   The WIC program would face over $16 million in higher cheese and milk prices. 
   Mr. President, the loss caused by Option 1A to the three major nutrition programs is $93 million. These regressive taxes unfairly burden children and the elderly. These hidden penalties on America's children and elderly must not be allowed to continue. 
   The fact is, we need a new national dairy policy that stops devastating small farmers, and imposing higher costs on taxpayers and consumers. 
   During my six years in the United States Senate, and twelve years in the Wisconsin State Senate, the overwhelming message I hear from dairy farmers in Wisconsin, Minnesota and throughout the Midwest, is that we need milk marketing order reform. 
   Congress recognized the need for a new national dairy policy, and in 1996, mandated that USDA reform the Federal milk marketing order system. 
   Well, let's take a look at why farmers across the U.S. support USDA's reforms. This chart compares Class I milk prices under the final rule and the current pricing system. 
   Under USDA's final rule dairy farmers in New England would receive 19.29 per hundredweight, a $.26 increase over the current system. Farmers in eastern New York and Northern New Jersey would receive $19.04 per hundredweight, an $.11 per hundredweight increase. In Northern Florida, farmers would receive $20.34, a $.97 increase over the current system. 
   These statistics underscore the importance of USDA's reforms for dairy farmers across the nation. 
   As this chart makes clear, USDA's reforms provide relief to America's  dairy farmers, and begin to re-institute fairness into our dairy pricing structure. 
   Perhaps even more compelling is this simple bar graph that illustrates the national average Class I milk price that farmers receive under the final rule and the current pricing system. 
   As you can see farmers would have received 58 cents more per hundredweight under USDA's final rule. 
   Farmers, consumer advocates, and taxpayer groups support USDA's reforms, and oppose these harmful dairy riders. 
   Mr. President, America's farmers demanded USDA's reforms. We should heed their call and support USDA's final rule. 
   Unfortunately, supporters of this legislation feel that they know better than America's dairy farmers, and wish to prevent USDA's moderate reforms. Ironically, one of the few changes to Federal dairy policy over the last 60 years has accelerated the attack on small farmers. 
   Despite the discrimination against Wisconsin dairy farmers under the Eau Claire rule, backdoor politicking during the eleventh hour of the conference committee for the 1996 farm bill, stuck America's dairy farmers with the devastatingly harmful Northeast Dairy Compact. This provision further aggravated the inequities of the Federal milk marketing order system by establishing the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. While the Compact may sound benign, it establishes a price fixing entity for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. 
   The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission is empowered to set minimum prices for fluid milk higher than those established under Federal milk marketing orders. Never mind that farmers in the Northeast already receive higher minimum prices under the antiquated, 60 year old Eau Claire rule. 
   The compact not only allows these six States to set artificially high prices for their producers, it permits them to block entry of lower-priced milk from producers in competing States. Further distorting the markets are subsidies given to processors in these six States to export their higher-priced milk to non-compact States. 
   Who can defend this system with a straight face? This compact amounts to nothing short of government-sponsored price fixing. It is outrageously unfair, and also bad policy. 
   The compact interferes with interstate commerce and wildly distorts the marketplace by erecting artificial barriers around one specially protected region of the nation. 
   The compact arbitrarily provides preferential price treatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers in other regions who work just as hard, who love their homes just as much and whose products are just as good or better. 
   It also irresponsibly encourages excess milk production in one region without establishing effective supply control. This practice flaunts basic economic principles and ignores the obvious risk that it will drive down milk prices for producers outside the compact region. 
   Despite what some have argued, the Northeast Dairy Compact hasn't even helped small Northeast farmers. 
   Since the Northeast first implemented its compact in 1997, small dairy farms in the Northeast, where this is supposed to help, have gone out of business at a rate of 41 percent higher than they had in the previous 2 years--41 percent higher. 
   In fact, compacts often amount to a transfer of wealth to large farms by affording large farms a per-farm subsidy that is actually 20 times greater than the meager subsidy given to small farmers. 
   We need to support USDA's moderate reforms, reject these harmful dairy riders and let our dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as some of my colleagues know, I have been posted, here on the Senate floor, day after day this week because of my concerns about the dairy provisions that are included in the budget package, and I know other Senators support those provisions because of the States they represent. For now, I just want to comment more broadly on the budget package and how we got here. 
   Mr. President, we have before us a measure that we are told will direct something like $400 billion in spending in such areas as the Justice Department including the FBI, Education including funding for local school districts, increased security for our foreign embassies, the Interior Department including our national parks system, Health and Human Services including critical funding for aging programs like the congregate and home delivered meals programs, and much more. 
   But, Mr. President, you would not know that by reading this bill. That roughly $400 billion in spending is distributed in a few pages of text. With the exception of District of Columbia funding, it's all on one page--the last page. 
   I have not been here as long as some of my colleagues, but I cannot recall ever seeing anything like this. Last year's omnibus appropriations bill was bad enough. It, too, lumped several appropriations bills together into one giant omnibus appropriations measure. It, too, was loaded with special interest measures that were slipped in, never having been debated, and unlikely to pass on their own. But at least, Mr. President, the spending done in that bill was explicitly a part of the document formally placed before the Senate. If you took the time to read the several thousand page appropriations bill, you would have found those items last year. 
   Mr. President, the bill before us is another matter entirely. It legislates by reference. Other than the DC Appropriations bill, there are no details provided in this document that indicate how those hundreds of billions of dollars are to be spent, only references to other bills. 
   Mr. President, when this bill goes to the President for his approval, what will he be signing into law? Essentially, he will be signing into law little more than a glorified table of contents. 
   Mr. President, this is a horrible precedent. This kind of gimmick may have been used before, but never on anything so momentous as an omnibus appropriations bill. And it is perhaps fitting that this piece of legislation should be structured the way it is. 
   This bill is the ``poster child'' of the 106th Congress. Unable to meet the budget deadline, we are once again presented with an omnibus appropriations bill, laden with the kind of special interest provisions that undermine our budget as well as the confidence of the public. And unwilling to bring any but a handful of authorizing bills to the floor for open debate, the leadership has now crammed this perverse bill full of legislation that has no business in an appropriations measure. 
   Mr. President, earlier this year this body voted to restore some order to the appropriations process by re-establishing the point of order against legislating on appropriations. This bill renders that exercise utterly meaningless. Worse, it means that while the Senate is precluded from adding authorizing language after thorough debate on the floor, a few people 
   in a backroom are free to add anything they wish, with no debate and out of public view. 
   Mr. President, the 106th Congress is not yet half over a but it has already earned itself a sorry reputation. This is the Congress of Convenience. The 106th Congress found it inconvenient to finish the simple job of passing appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year, so it cuts a few backroom deals and lumps five appropriations bills together. The 106th Congress found it inconvenient to debate authorizing bills fully and openly, so it bundled several together and shoved them into this omnibus appropriations bill. And now, the 106th Congress finds it inconvenient to provide even the details of this $400 billion compost heap, so it engages in some drafting gymnastics, and gives the public little more than a glorified table of contents. 
   Mr. President, I realize there are some strong feelings about the provisions of this bill. I know that some of my colleagues support some of the provisions in this measure. Chances are there are provisions in this measure that I, too, would support, but how would I know? But I hope that a few weeks from now, after this thing is enacted, my colleagues will consider just what has been wrought this week and this past year. The normal procedures of the Senate and the other body have been run over by a steamroller in the name of political expediency and convenience, and that cannot be good, even for those who may have gained a temporary victory. 
   In the play A Man for All Seasons, there is an exchange between Sir Thomas More and his son-in-law, Roper. More asks Roper--``What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the devil?'' Roger responds--``I'd cut down every law in England to do that!'' More then replies--``Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? *.*.* This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast--man's laws, not God's--and if you cut them down--and you're just the man to do it--d'you really think you could just stand upright in the winds that would blow then?'' 
   Mr. President, the 106th Congress has done more than its share of flattening our rules and procedures. Those of us in the minority on the issue before us today perhaps feel it most keenly, but let me suggest that many more may come to regret the precedents set by the Congress of Convenience.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a piece of legislation that is not moving this year. I want to speak about it because it deals with an extremely important topic, one that has not received the attention and commitment that it deserves from this body. 
   That topic is the appropriate state of U.S.-Indonesian relations today. 
   Mr. President, I introduced S. 1568, the East Timor Self-Determination Act of 1999, on September 8--well over two months ago. That legislation, which passed the Foreign Relations Committee on September 27 by an overwhelming vote of 17-1, was cosponsored by the Chairman of that Committee as well as many other Members of the Senate. 
   I took that action, in cooperation with my colleagues, because events in East and West Timor demanded it. 
   On August 30, well over 99% of registered voters in East Timor courageously came to the polls to express their will regarding the political status of that territory. 
   More than 78% of those voters marked their ballot in favor of independence. 
   But weeks of violence immediately followed the vote, as the Indonesian military--a military that our country has long supported--colluded with militia groups in waging a scorched earth campaign against the East Timorese people and their democratic aspirations throughout the territory. 
   Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee, and many were killed. 
   But for the East Timorese run out of their homes in the fray, the nightmare did not end there. 
   There seems to be a perception out there that all is well in Indonesia today, and that the East Timor crisis is over. Unfortunately, that is simply not true. 
   Last week, the Associated Press reported on the public comments of the spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The  spokesman said that many East Timorese are being forced at gunpoint to remain in camps that lack food, sanitation and medical care. He said, and this is a direct quote, that ``the moment an East Timorese expresses a desire to leave the camps and go home their life is in danger.'' And the UNHCR spokesperson noted, in last week's AP report, that many relief organizations have received reports of refugees being raped and beaten by militiamen. 
   Mr. President, to this day, militia members harass and intimidate East Timorese in West Timor's refugee camps. Only about 56,000 refugees have returned home to East Timor. Approximately two hundred thousand remain, in many cases against their will, in the refugee camps of West Timor. 
   To this day, humanitarian organizations do not have the access that they need to all of the refugee camps to which East Timorese fled. 
   Throughout all of this pain, throughout the destruction of lives and property, throughout this brutal retaliation for courageous acts of democratic expression, this Senate has been silent. We have had no floor debate and no vote. My original bill, despite being voted out of committee with only one dissenting vote, has languished on the calendar for weeks. 
   In response to that silence, Mr. President, I negotiated an arrangement to introduce an amendment to the bankruptcy bill addressing this issue. Squeezing this important topic into the middle of a debate on an unrelated bill was certainly not the most desirable approach, but I was determined to pursue this legislation. 
   The amendment I had planned to offer was considerably different from my original bill. I made significant alterations to it in order to respond to changing events and the concerns of other Senators and the Administration. 
   Mr. President, I wanted to pursue this legislation to encourage democracy and accountability in Indonesia, and to hold out clear incentives for a policy of accountability and cooperation. And I wanted to hold this Administration to its word, ensuring that passing political whims do not soften America's rejection of the kind of methods that the Indonesian military used in East Timor. 
   The amendment would have reached out to the Indonesian government, celebrating its democratic transition and recognizing its economic needs, while keeping the pressure on elements in Indonesia that are moving in the opposite direction--elements moving away from democracy, reform, and accountability and moving toward repression, violence, and impunity. 
   With its clear message and incentives, this amendment would have set the stage for a responsible and strong partnership between the U.S. and Indonesia. 
   Mr. President, it concerns me that the Administration has behaved as though they wish this legislation would just go away, although it is a codification of their own policy. 
   The Administration has told me that they desire more flexibility--particularly with regard to licensing defense related articles for export to Indonesia--than this amendment would allow. 
   Despite the fact that I worked closely and carefully with the State Department to develop a reasonable list of conditions that must be met in order to re-establish miliary and security relations, in the end, the Administration did not want to be pinned down to any standards at all. 
   Mr. President, I will speak frankly. The Administration's unwillingness to commit to a responsible policy and to a solid series of prerequisites for resuming military and security ties concerns me, and convinces me that vigilance will be necessary in the months ahead. 
   And so Mr. President, while I foresee no opportunity to move this legislation this year, I want to remind this Senate and this Administration that my amendment will remain in order when we return to the bankruptcy bill, and I am prepared to take up this issue again in January, or at any other time the circumstances warrant it. 
   I will continue to be certain that this Senate has a voice in the future of U.S.-Indonesian relations. I will continue to push for accountability for the abuses perpetrated by the Indonesian military and militia groups. And I will continue to insist that U.S. engagement with the Indonesian miliary is contingent upon an end to the harassment and intimidation of East Timorese refugees with impunity. 
   I pledge to my colleagues and to this Administration that I will monitor this matter, and monitor it closely in the weeks and months ahead. I will stand by, ready with several versions of my legislation, should the Indonesian military fail to take the steps toward reform and accountability that are absolutely essential prerequisites to a military and security relationship with the United States. 
   And make no mistake, I will come to the floor again and again should this Administration appear ready to engage with and support an Indonesian military that has not seriously lived up to its own commitment to respect the rights of ordinary East Timorese civilians who seek only to live their lives in peace and security. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague, Senator KOHL, for his efforts to fight for Wisconsin dairy farmers. We have worked long and hard together on this. We are determined to see this through. 
   For 60 years, dairy farmers across America have been steadily driven out of business and disadvantaged by the current Federal dairy policy. It is hard to believe this, but in 1950 Wisconsin had over 143,000 dairy farms; after nearly 50 years of the current dairy policy, Wisconsin is left with only 23,000 dairy farms. Let me repeat that: from 143,000 to 23,000 during this time period. 
   Why would anyone seek to revive a dairy policy that has destroyed over 110,000 dairy farms in a single State? That is more than five out of six farms in the last half century. This devastation has not been limited to Wisconsin. Since 1950, America has lost over 3 million dairy farms, and this trend is accelerating. Since 1958, America has lost over half of its dairy producers. 
   Day after day, season after season, we are losing dairy farms at an alarming rate. While the operations disappear, we are seeing the emergence of larger dairy farms. The trend toward large dairy operations is mirrored in States throughout the Nation. The economic losses associated with the reduction of small farms goes well beyond the impact of individual farm families who have been forced off the land. It is much broader than that. 
   The loss of these farms has devastated rural communities where small, family-owned dairy farms are the key to economic stability. 
   As Senator KOHL has alluded to during the consideration of the 1996 farm bill, Congress did seek to make changes in the unjust Federal pricing system by phasing out the milk price support program and to finally reduce the inequities between the regions. 
   Unfortunately, that is not what happened at all. It didn't work. Because of the back-door politicking during the eleventh hour of the conference committee, America's dairy farmers were stuck with the devastatingly harmful Northeast Dairy Compact. Although it is painful and difficult for everyone, we in the Upper Midwest cannot stand for that or any change that further disadvantages our dairy farms--the ones who are left, not the tens of thousands who are gone but the less than 25,000 who remain. We are determined to keep them in business. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact accentuates the current system's equities by authorizing six Northeastern States to establish a minimum price for fluid milk, higher even than those established under the Federal milk marketing order, which are already pretty high and, frankly, much higher than our folks get. The compact not only allows the six States to set artificially high prices for producers but permits them to block the entry of lower-priced milk from competing States. Further distorting the market are subsidies given to processors in these six States to export their higher-priced milk to noncompact States. 
   Despite what some argue, the Northeastern Dairy Compact has not even helped small Northeastern farmers. Since the Northeast first implemented the compact in 1997, small dairy farms in the Northeast, which are supposed to have been helped, have gone out of business at a rate of 41 percent higher than they had in the previous 2 years. It is not even working for the limited purposes it was supposed to serve. 
   Compacts often amount to a transfer of wealth to large farms by affording large farms a per farm subsidy that is actually 20 times greater than the meager subsidy given to small farmers. 
   As my senior colleague has indicated, we need to support the moderate reforms of the USDA and reject the harmful dairy rider and let our dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk. I know as we go through the coming days this may mean substantial delays. We all want to go home to our States as early as possible. However, Senator KOHL and I are determined to do our best to fight for the remaining Wisconsin dairy farmers. Some of those steps may be necessary in order to achieve that goal. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I call for the regular order with respect to amendment No. 2748. 
   I wish to speak on the landlord-tenant amendment I offered last week and, in particular, take a few minutes to respond to some of the arguments made against it by the Senator from Alabama. This amendment is designed to lessen the harsh consequences of section 311 of the bill with respect to tenants while at the same time protecting the legitimate financial interests of landlords. 
   Just to review, current law provides for an automatic stay of eviction proceedings upon the filing of a bankruptcy case. Landlords may apply for relief at that stage so the eviction can proceed. But it is a process that often takes a few months. 
   Section 311 of Senate bill 625, the bill we are considering, eliminates the stay in all landlord-tenant cases so that an eviction can proceed immediately. In essence, my amendment would allow tenants to remain in their apartments while trying to sort out the difficult consequences of bankruptcy if, and only if, they are willing to pay the rent that comes due after they file for bankruptcy. If the tenant fails to pay the rent, the stay can be lifted 15 days after the landlord provides notice to the court that the rent has not been paid. If the reason for eviction is drug use or property damage, the stay can also be lifted after 15 days. 
   Finally, if the lease has actually expired by its terms--in other words, if there is no more time on the lease and the landlord plans to move into the property--then, again, after 15 days notice the eviction can proceed. This 15-day notice period does not apply if the tenant has filed for bankruptcy previously. In other words, in cases of repeat filings, the stay never takes effect, just as under section 311 in this bill. 
   So we are all clear on why this whole issue came up in the first place, the main abuse that has been alleged is in Los Angeles County, where unscrupulous bankruptcy petition preparers advertise filing bankruptcy as a way to live rent free. Under my amendment, first of all, you could never live rent free. The debtor must pay rent after filing for bankruptcy. If the debtor misses a rent payment, the stay will be lifted 15 days later. Second of all, the automatic stay does not take effect if the tenant is a repeat filer. So we take care of this problem of the repeat filer, which is exactly what the Senator from Alabama and others portrayed in committee as the reason this provision is needed. 
   So my amendment gets at the abuse, and it protects the rights and economic interests of the landlord. What it eliminates, though, is the punitive aspect of this amendment and the possibility that tenants who are willing and able to pay rent once they get a little breathing room from their other creditors will instead be put out on the street. 
   I am, frankly, disappointed that my colleague from Alabama insists on the harsh aspects of section 311 when my amendment would get at the problem he has identified just as well. 
   The Senator from Alabama argued yesterday that somehow my amendment changes current law and moves us in the direction of litigation and delay. On the contrary, my amendment leaves intact the current law that allows landlords to get relief from the automatic stay. Let me be very clear about that. My amendment does not eliminate the ability of landlords to apply for relief from the stay under current law. The law now gives debtors some breathing room in legal proceedings, including eviction proceedings. But landlords can apply for relief from the stay. It is not an abuse of the law to take advantage of the automatic stay to get your affairs in order. Some tenants use that time to work out a payment schedule for their back rent so they can avoid eviction. Most landlords don't want to throw people out on the street. They just want to be paid. My amendment requires that they be paid once bankruptcy is filed, or the eviction can proceed immediately. But even if the rent is paid while the bankruptcy case is pending, if a landlord can still seek relief from stay under the normal procedures and press forward with the eviction. 
   I frankly think that most landlords will be happy to let a tenant stay as long as the rent is being paid. Who knows, if the bankruptcy is successful, especially if it is a Chapter 13, the tenant may be able to pay the past due rent. That certainly is not going to happen if the tenant is evicted. But if the landlord really doesn't want the tenant to stay, the landlord can seek relief. So my amendment doesn't allow a tenant to stay in the apartment indefinitely by resuming payment of rent. By no means does this amendment permit a tenant to stay in an apartment indefinitely without a lease. 
   And any suggestion to the contrary is just wrong. It doesn't do that at all. It just covers the few months after the bankruptcy petition is filed when the debtor is most vulnerable and the debtor is most in need of a roof over his or her head. 
   Now let me address one of the frequent refrains of the Senator from Alabama when he talks about this provision. He seems to be very offended by the idea that people are staying in  their apartments after the term of their lease has expired. Those who are familiar with landlord-tenant law know that this is commonplace in the rental market. Many, many leases are for a term of one year but convert to a month to month lease when the year is up. The contract essentially remains in force, but the term has expired. There is nothing wrong with that. It is perfectly legitimate. Typically, the conversion to month-to-month tenancy is provided for in standard lease language. 
   This is not an abuse. It is the way many leases proceed in this country on a day-to-day basis. 
   Furthermore, the language of section 311 doesn't lift the stay when the term of a lease has expired but rather in cases where ``a rental agreement has terminated under the lease agreement or applicable state law.'' Well, most rental agreements ``terminate'' when a rent payment is missed. So section 311 applies in all landlord-tenant cases, not just those where the lease term has expired. 
   I want to remind my colleagues that both the bill we passed last year, and the conference report had a form of the protection that my amendment provides for debtors. Section 311 of the bill that we are working on now is harsher on tenant debtor than the conference report from last year and than the House bill that passed earlier this year. 
   Now let me respond to what I think is the core of Senator SESSIONS' objection to my amendment. He said last week that the automatic stay is always lifted, that the tenant never wins. So why not just get rid of the stay. It's just a waste of time and money for the landlord.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Mr. Sommers heard the remarks of the Senator from Alabama last week in opposition to my amendment. He writes:  
   The statement was made that landlords always prevail in automatic stay motions. This is not correct. In my personal experience, I doubt that landlords have prevailed in even 20% of the cases. in most of the other cases, the family paid the rent and the motion was either withdrawn or denied.  
   Mr. Sommers goes on to state:  
   The more important point is that in most cases no motion is brought by the landlord. The automatic say does what it is intended to do. In these cases, the family that was facing eviction cures the rent arrears and remains in its apartment. The landlord is made whole, and the family is permitted the time necessary to reorganize its finances.  
   Mr. Sommers also discusses my amendment.  
   To the extent there are abuses in the current system, your amendment will provide prompt and efficient relief by giving landlords a streamlined procedure that could be pursued quickly and without an attorney.  
   That's a crucial point, Mr. President, because one of the concerns expressed by the Senator from Alabama is the expense and inconvenience of the relief from stay process for landlords under current law. Mr. Sommers concludes:  
   Your amendment would make it impossible to obtain significant delay simply by filing a bankruptcy petition, as can occur today. But it would not hurt the innocent family, struggling to get its finances together, that is able to begin making rent payments and cure its rent default.  
   That is really the crucial point Mr. President. We are talking about real people here. People who are very vulnerable. The Senator from Alabama argued yesterday that a landlord may have another tenant lined up to move into an apartment. And he said that if my amendment were adopted, and I'm quoting here, ``that tenant's life may be disrupted if the landlord can't deliver the premises.'' Well, Mr. President, what about the life of the current tenant, very possibly a single mother with children? For months she's been trying to make ends meet, but the 
   child support she is owned by her ex-husband has not been coming. She misses a few rent payments as she tries to make sure her children are fed and their home is heated. The landlord starts eviction proceedings. And she is forced to file for bankruptcy. 
   Now once the bankruptcy is filed, and her other creditors are temporarily at bay, she can pay her rent. On time and in full. What about disruption to her life if we put her and her children out on the street? Do we not care about that? If the landlord is not economically harmed, why wouldn't we allow her to stay in her apartment for a few months more? Why can't we maintain the breathing room that the automatic stay under current law provides? What is so terrible about that? 
   Mr. President, this is the situation I am concerned about. I want to respond in a reasonable way to the abuses that section 311 is supposedly designed to address. But I don't want to cause undue hardship to people who are able to pay their rent while their bankruptcy case is pending. 
   In the spirit of compromise, I have proposed a few other changes to the amendment to the Senator from Alabama, in response to some of the concerns he and his staff have raised. We are trying to listen very carefully to the points that the Senator from Alabama is making. First, I am willing to have the stay lifted not only in cases where the lease has expired and the landlord wants to move into the property, but also in cases where the landlord wants to let a member of his or her immediate family to occupy the premises. I will expand the language in my amendment to cover that situation. 
   I will also expand the language to cover a situation where the lease has expired and the landlord has entered into a signed and enforceable agreement with another tenant before the bankruptcy petition is filed. That is the situation that the Senator from Alabama has suggested creates an unbearable hardship for the new tenant. So if a new lease has been made before the debtor files for bankruptcy, the landlord can apply for expedited relief from the stay. 
   Finally, Mr. President, it has been suggested that some debtors will try to game the system by filing for bankruptcy the day after a rent payment is due, thus giving themselves almost a free month in the apartment before my amendment would apply. I am willing to try to stop this kind of abuse by requiring debtors to pay any rent that comes due up to 10 days before the filing of the petition. 
   Mr. President, I am trying to be reasonable. I am going to make these changes in a second degree amendment and I hope the Senator from Alabama will accept the amendment. I want my colleagues to understand that this amendment is designed to address the abuses that the Senator from Alabama has identified, but do it in a much more reasonable way, so that we can protect some very vulnerable people from being thrown out on the streets at a very difficult time in their lives.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am disappointed in the response of the Senator from Alabama. His comments to the effect that the only thing we should be considering is State laws having to do with leases and contracts almost suggests to me he does not believe there is any role for Federal bankruptcy law. 
   Bankruptcy law is contemplated in the U.S. Constitution. It certainly was not understood there would be no role at all for Federal bankruptcy law to have an impact on people's lives in our States, whether it be Alabama or Wisconsin. The automatic stay is an integral part of the federal bankruptcy  laws and its purpose is not just to protect the property of the estate but also to provide some breathing room for the debtor. 
   I will be the first to concede to the Senator from Alabama that one of the concerns in bankruptcy has to be making sure creditors get paid as much as possible and as efficiently as possible. That is legitimate. And a second important concern is to make sure people do not abuse the bankruptcy system. 
   But the concern the Senator from Alabama refuses to address, refuses to discuss, is that the bankruptcy law is supposed to help people get back on their feet. I will tell you that one lousy way to help people get back on their feet is to kick them out of their apartments, 
   when it serves no financial interest of the landlord for that to happen. 
   The Senator from Alabama simply refuses to address the example I gave of a single woman with children, who is not getting her child support, who wants to and is prepared to pay her rent and is simply running into trouble and is ready to pay it again after she files for bankruptcy and has a stay against her other creditors. In the world that the Senator from Alabama portrays, this person loses out. This is deeply troubling to me. 
   What more can you do than listen to a colleague give hypothetical after hypothetical after hypothetical about what might be wrong with the amendment and try to specifically address those concerns? That is exactly what I have done in making the changes contained in my second degree amendment. 
   So, yes, efficiency in preventing abuses is an important principle. Let me review: The Senator from Alabama, both in committee and on the floor, has attempted to suggest that all kinds of abuses will still continue under the amendment that we have. The trouble is, the abuses he cites and the statistics he cites are all irrelevant to my amendment. My amendment will prevent the abuses. 
   He talks about the abuse of lawyers who do repeat filings, especially in Los Angeles County. We addressed that. Under our amendment, if you do multiple filings, you are out of luck; the stay is lifted automatically. Essentially, the provisions of the bill that the Senator from Alabama prefers apply in that situation. 
   In committee he argued against my amendment by saying: What happens if a landlord wants to move back into his own place? All right. We took care of that. We address that concern in the amendment. But then he says: What happens if his brother wants to move into the place? Well, we took care of that concern in this second degree amendment that I just offered. 
   Here is another example, because instead of admitting that we have actually dealt with some of these hypotheticals, he says: What happens if the landlord has a signed agreement for a new lease prior to the filing of the bankruptcy? We addressed that concern too, but that still isn't good enough. 
   But I tell you what frustrates me the most. The Senator from Alabama keeps saying that people will live rent free. It is as if I have said nothing here on the floor at all. It is as if I have not said, time after time after time, that under my amendment a tenant cannot live rent free for 5 or 6 months, as the Senator has suggested. After filing for bankruptcy, if you do not pay your rent as it comes due, you are out of there under my amendment. 
   So what is all this talk about abuses, when in each and every hypothetical the Senator has proposed in committee or on the floor we have addressed his concern? We have addressed abuse. We have addressed the fact that the system has to be efficient. 
   But what has not been addressed and what this amendment is trying to deal with is what the Senator from Alabama simply ignores. He gives no hope; he gives no alternative to the person that I describe: the woman with children, who is not getting her child support, who is willing and able to pay her rent once she files for bankruptcy, but the Senator from Alabama would have her booted out of her apartment with her kids at the very moment when she is trying to get back on her feet. 
   So I urge the Senator from Alabama to actually review all of my attempts to try to address his concerns so that I can feel at least that this has been a process where he has raised concerns that he was worried about and we tried to deal with them. That is what we have been doing in debating and modifying this amendment. 
   I know on other issues we have been able to do that with the Senator, and I appreciate that. But I urge him, surely there has to be a better answer than just ``tough luck'' for these individuals who I have described, who are not in a position where they are going to abuse the system, who cannot get month after month of free 
   rent living, because that is exactly what we dealt to prevent in the amendment. We have specifically dealt with the problem of a person who tries to get more than 1 month of rent free. 
   The whole problem with this overall bill is sort of symbolized by this debate. There needs to be some balance. I have recognized, in that spirit, the call of the Senator from Alabama for more efficiency, the call of the Senator from Alabama for preventing abuses. But where is the balance? Where is the recognition that there are human beings with limited resources who may need the opportunity to stay in that apartment and pay the rent after the bankruptcy is filed? 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   My intent, as I have indicated time and again, is to try to make sure a person who is in this position has to pay that rent once they file for bankruptcy, and keep paying it or else they are out of luck. And the goal, just so it is clear to the Senator from Alabama, is obviously not to create that kind of scenario you described. If fact, you just made our case, that the maximum exposure there would probably be about 6 weeks, not 6 months, as you suggested.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Alabama. Frankly, this isn't really about a great passion on this issue. All I am trying to achieve is some balance. I do think landlords should be paid their rent. I do think it is terrible when people abuse the system. 
   But in case after case where the Senator from Alabama has presented an abuse, we have tried to address it. What it all came down to, when I asked him what he still objected to, was that he fundamentally doesn't believe in the principle behind the bankruptcy system, which is giving people an opportunity to get back on their feet and providing a little breathing room in the case of the type of person I described. 
   I described a single woman with children who is not getting her child support, who is in danger of being booted out of that apartment. When the Senator responds, he talks about the people who game the system, people who have different debts all over the place and who can hire sophisticated attorneys. That is not who we are talking about. 
   In fact, I refer back to Mr. Sommer's summary of what my amendment would do. The amendment is actually perfectly tailored to the situation of the person who can't hire a lawyer or afford a lawyer. That is who we are talking about. We are talking about people who certainly are not sophisticated enough or able to game the bankruptcy system. They are not in that category at all. They are people who simply want to stay in their apartment. They have financial problems, but once they file for bankruptcy, they want to be able to start paying that rent again. 
   Let me read what Mr. Sommer said. He is not a person who 
   works on bankruptcy. He is a distinguished author on bankruptcy law. He wrote to me:  
   To the extent there are abuses in the current system, your amendment will provide prompt and efficient relief by giving landlords a streamlined procedure that could be pursued quickly and without an attorney.  
   Let me reiterate that. So much of the argument of the Senator from Alabama is premised on the idea that this is somehow a sweet deal for lawyers. What this expert says is that these provisions allow this kind of opportunity for a person who needs it without an attorney. He writes:  
   Your amendment would make it impossible to obtain any significant delay simply by filing a bankruptcy petition, as can occur today.  
   This expert makes it very clear that this is a significant improvement over current bankruptcy law, of which the Senator from Alabama is critical. Even with my amendment, he says it is almost impossible to obtain any significant delay simply by filing a bankruptcy petition. He concedes that some of that could happen today, as the Senator from Alabama has pointed out. 
   Here is the last line, the critical piece that the Senator from Alabama simply won't address, when it comes to one of the purposes of Federal bankruptcy law. Mr. Sommer says:  
   But it would not hurt the innocent family, struggling to get its finances together, that is able to begin making rent payments and cure its rent default.  
   That is all I am trying to do, to get some balance here so that an innocent family that is trying to get its act together and finances together doesn't get booted out of its apartment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleagues, Senators LEAHY, BROWNBACK, and JEFFORDS, to introduce a bill that will reduce the likelihood that people fleeing genuine persecution in their homelands and seeking refuge in America will be unfairly returned to their countries. 
   Mr. President, as you know, our nation has been built by people who arrived on our shores from all over the world. Immigrants have enriched our nation economically, culturally, and in so many other invaluable ways. I don't think anyone can dispute that, of all the countries in the world, our nation has the deepest, richest commitment to welcoming all people who want to make a new home and a new life. 
   At the same time, Mr. President, our nation also has a deep tradition of welcoming those who are fleeing oppression in their native land. From the pilgrims who set foot in present day Massachusetts and Virginia, to the Kosovars who fled brutality in their homeland earlier this year, America has been a safe refuge for those fleeing persecution. Our nation's first president, George Washington, said: ``America is open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, but the oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions.'' George Washington said those words in 1783. One hundred and one years later, France would present our country with a gift, a statue called ``Liberty Enlightening the World.'' In 1884, that title was a profound statement of our nation's past, our present and hope for the future. ``Liberty Enlightening the World'' later became known as the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty has these words inscribed on her: 
 ..... Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!  
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, our current asylum and immigration laws have nearly slammed the door shut on victims of persecution, even those who are sure to suffer if returned to their home countries. Current law originates with the passage in 1996 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. That law was an attempt to combat illegal immigration. But in the process, Congress denied victims of persecution the protection that our nation historically has offered. The current system provides for the immediate deportation of individuals who arrive without travel documents precisely in order. Now, Mr. President, it's appropriate that we require these 
   documents, but people who have fled torture and great brutality may not have proper documentation because of the circumstances under which they fled their homelands. As a result, genuine victims of persecution face the risk of being turned away at our borders and put on the next plane back to face imprisonment, torture or death. The 1996 law effectively empowers low level INS officers to summarily make the life and death decision as to whether to deport an asylum seeker. Prior to 1996, those decisions were made by an immigration judge. We must return a judicial role to the review of asylum claims. 
   As my colleagues who were here in 1995 and 1996 may recall, the 1996 law  was enacted in reaction to a flurry of concern that our border controls were too lax. The debate on the 1996 law was fueled by legitimate concern over criminals who managed to enter the country and commit acts of terrorism or other crimes. In response, the INS began a sensible tightening of the asylum process. In 1994 and 1995, the INS ceased issuing work authorizations at the border. Instead, asylum seekers had to wait until an adjudication of their case before receiving work authorization. As a result, claims for asylum dropped dramatically--those who were seeking work but did not have a legitimate fear of persecution were no longer claiming asylum. The INS reforms were effective. But the 1996 law went too far. In our rush to keep undesirable asylum applicants out, Congress created a system where those with bona fide asylum claims face the great risk of being immediately deported to face the wrath of oppressive home governments without a real chance to make their case. 
   Because an INS officer has the authority to deport refugees immediately, with no record keeping requirement, it has been difficult to determine exactly how many genuine refugees with a valid fear of persecution in their home countries have been turned away at our airports and borders as a result of the 1996 law. Organizations like the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, however, have been able to collect some data on the extent of the problem. 
   One of the most troubling stories is the case of a 21-year-old Kosovar Albanian known as ``Dem.'' In October 1998, Serb police seized Dem at his home, beat him, and threatened to kill his family. This abuse occurred over a period of ten days. When the Serb police finally released Dem, he fled Kosovo. He eventually made his way to the United States in January of this year, landing in California via Mexico City. When he arrived, the INS arranged for a Serbian translator to assist by telephone with its questioning of Dem. But Dem, a Kosovar Albanian, could not speak Serbian. After the translator spoke with Dem, the translator said something to the INS officer. The INS officer promptly handcuffed and fingerprinted Dem and then put him on a plane back to Mexico City. 
   Fortunately, Dem was not returned to Kosovo. Dem tried re-entering the United States and on this second attempt, he was allowed to apply for asylum. But the facts supporting Dem's asylum claim had not changed. We must fix a system that produces such arbitrary results where people's lives, and American ideals, are at stake. 
   We don't know exactly how many victims of real persecution have been immediately deported, and we obviously don't know exactly what has happened to each victim since enactment of the 1996 law. What we do know is that an asylum seeker who is fleeing torture, abuse or death faces the risk of being kicked out of our country, without even obtaining a perfunctory hearing before an immigration judge. 
   The Refugee Protection Act of 1999 will return fairness and due process to the treatment of asylum seekers. For non-emergency migration situations, the bill would restore the pre-1996 law, when immigration judges were involved in the decision to deport someone who claimed asylum. The current process will continue to apply in emergency migration situations and would designate the Attorney General as the official with authority to determine when an emergency migration situation exists. The bill also would provide that an emergency cannot exist for more than 90 days, unless the Attorney General, after consultation with the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, determines that the emergency situation continues to exist. 
   Mr. President, this is a sensible bill that allows us to scrutinize those who come to our borders, but honors our best traditions and returns fairness and humanity to our treatment of those who are fleeing persecution. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senators LEAHY, BROWNBACK and JEFFORDS in fighting for basic human dignity, decency and justice. Let us lift the torch of ``Liberty Enlightening the World'' once again. Let us not reflexively turn away those whose very lives may depend on a fair hearing as they seek refuge in the United States.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 1999, a bill I introduced last Wednesday. This bill will put an immediate halt to executions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations of Federal law. 
   Since the beginning of this year, this Chamber has echoed with debate on violence in America. We have heard about violence in our schools and neighborhoods. But I am not so sure that we in Government don't contribute to this casual attitude we sometimes see toward killing and death. With each new death penalty statute enacted and each execution carried out, our executive, judicial and legislative branches, at both the State and Federal level, add to a culture of violence and killing. With each person executed, we are teaching our children that the way to settle scores is through violence, even to the point of taking a human life. 
   Those who favor the death penalty should be pressed to explain why fallible human beings should presume to use the power of the state to extinguish the life of a fellow human being on our collective behalf. Those who oppose the death penalty should demand that explanation adamantly, and at every turn. But only a zealous few try. We should do better. And we should use this moment to do better as we step not only into a new century but also a new millennium, the first such landmark since the depths of the Middle Ages. 
   Across the globe, with every American who is executed, the entire world watches and asks, How can the Americans, the champions of human rights, compromise their own professed beliefs in this way? A majority of nations have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Even Russia and South Africa--nations that for years were symbols of egregious violations of basic human rights and liberties--have seen the error of the use of the death penalty. Next month, Italy and other European nations--nations with which the United States enjoys its closest relationships--are expected to introduce a resolution in the U.N. General Assembly calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty. 
   So why does the United States remain one of the nations in the distinct minority to use the death penalty? Some argue that the death penalty is a proper punishment because it is a deterrent. But they are sadly, sadly mistaken. The Federal Government and most States in the United States have a death penalty, while our European counterparts do not. Following the logic of death penalty supporters who believe it is a deterrent, you would think that our European allies, who don't use the death penalty, would have a much higher murder rate than we do in the United States. Yet, they don't; and it is not even close. In fact, the murder rate in the United States is six times higher than the murder rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than in Australia, and five times higher than in Sweden. 
   But we don't even need to look across the Atlantic to see that capital punishment has no deterrent effect on crime. Let's compare Wisconsin and Texas. I am proud of the fact that my great State, Wisconsin, was the first State in this Nation to abolish the death penalty completely, when it did so in 1853. So Wisconsin has been death penalty-free for nearly 150 years. In contrast, Texas is the most prodigious user of the death penalty, having executed 192 people since 1976. So let's look at the murder rate in Wisconsin and in Texas. During the period from 1995 to 1998, Texas has had a murder rate that is nearly double the murder rate in Wisconsin. This data alone calls into question the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder. 
   I want to be clear. I believe murderers and other violent offenders should be severely punished. I am not seeking to open the prison doors and let murderers come rushing out into our communities. I don't want to free them. But the question is, Should the death penalty be a means of punishment in our society? 
   The fact that our society relies on killing as punishment is disturbing enough. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the States' and the Federal Government's use of the death penalty is often not consistent with the principles of due process, fairness and justice. 
   It just cannot be disputed that we are sending innocent people to death. Since  the modern death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, we have released 82 men and women from death row. Why? Because they were innocent. That's one death row inmate found innocent for every seven executed. One in seven! That's a pretty poor performance for American justice. 
   Another reason we need to abolish the death penalty is the specter of racism in our criminal justice system. Even though our nation has abandoned slavery and segregation, we unfortunately are still living with vestiges of institutional racism. In some cases, racism can be found at every stage of a capital trial--in the selection of jurors, during the presentation of evidence, and sometimes during jury deliberations. 
   After the 1976 Supreme Court Gregg decision upholding the use of the death penalty, the death penalty was first enacted as a sentence at the federal level with passage of the Drug Kingpin Statute in 1988. Since that time, numerous additional federal crimes have become death penalty-eligible, bringing the total to about 60 statutes today. At the federal level, 21 people have been sentenced to death. Of those 21 on the federal government's death row, 14 are black and only 5 are white. One defendant is Hispanic and another Asian. That means 16 of the 21 people on federal death row are minorities. That's just over 75%. And the numbers are worse on the military's death row. Seven of the eight men, or 87.5%, on military death row are minorities. 
   One thing is clear: no matter how hard we try, we cannot overcome the inevitable fallibility of being human. That fallibility means that we will not be able to apply the death penalty in a fair and just manner. 
   At the end of 1999, at the end of a remarkable century and millennium of progress, I cannot help but believe that our progress has been tarnished with our nation's not only continuing, but increasing use of the death penalty. As of today, the United States has executed 585 people since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. In those 23 years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of executions. This year the United States has already set a record for the most executions in our country in one year, 85--the latest execution being that of Ricky Drayton, who was executed by lethal injection just last Friday by the state of South Carolina. And the year isn't even over yet. We are on track to hit close to 100 executions this year. This is astounding and it is embarrassing. We are a nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. We are one of the first nations to speak out against torture and killings by foreign governments. It is time for us to look in the mirror. 
   Two former Supreme Court justices did just that. In 1994, Justice Harry Blackmun penned the following eloquent dissent:  
   From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have endeavored--indeed, I have struggled--along with a majority of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle the Court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. It is virtually self-evident to me now that no combination of procedural rules or substantive regulations ever can save the death penalty from its inherent constitutional deficiencies.  
   Similarly, after supporting Supreme Court decisions upholding the death penalty, Justice Lewis Powell in 1991 told his biographer that he now thought capital punishment should be abolished. After sitting on our nation's highest court for over 20 years, Justices Blackmun and Powell came to understand the randomness and unfairness of the death penalty. It is time for our nation to follow the lead of these distinguished jurists. 
   The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is immoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right,'' could not be more appropriate here. Our nation has long ago done away with other barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of suspected criminals. Just as our nation did away with these punishments as contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death penalty as we enter the next century. The continued viability of our justice system as a truly just system requires that we do so. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing the death penalty in our great nation. Last week, I introduced a bill that abolishes the death penalty at the federal level. I call on all states that have the death penalty to also cease this practice. Let us step away from the culture of violence and restore fairness and integrity to our criminal justice system. As we head into the next millennium, let us leave this archaic practice behind. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am on the floor today principally to continue to battle for our Wisconsin dairy industry and Wisconsin dairy farmers. As I was here today, I had a chance to reflect on something else about Wisconsin that we will be bragging about today. I come here as a proud alumnus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Of course, I am talking about the new career rushing record in college football just set by one of the greatest Badgers of all time, Ron Dayne. 
   Ron Dayne rushed his way into football glory on Saturday. After rushing for an incredible 6,181 yards in his career, he needed only 99 yards to break the record set last year by Texas's Ricky Williams. 
   Short runs throughout the first half brought him within yards of the record and helped his team build an early lead. Then, with 5 minutes left in the second quarter, he broke the record on a 31-yard sprint and went on to rush a total of 216 yards to help catapult the Badgers--with my apologies to my colleagues from the Hawkeye State--to a crushing 41-3 victory against Iowa. 
   I quote from Matt Bowen, a leading tackler for the University of Iowa, on the difficulty of stopping University of Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne. Matt said: ``It's like trying to catch a couch as it tumbles down a few flights of stairs.'' 
   With this achievement, Ron Dayne has rushed his way into the front of a pack of Heisman hopefuls, and he has helped guarantee his team another trip to Pasadena on New Year's day as the undisputed champions of the Big 10. Through it all, Ron Dayne has been a model person as well as a model team player, exhibiting a modesty and dedication that make him a Badger hero for the ages. 
   On Saturday, as jubilant Badger football fans waved their souvenir Dayne towels in the air at Camp Randall Stadium and chanted Ron Dayne's name, they celebrated a great victory for Wisconsin, and above all they celebrated a player who does honor to his school, to himself, and to the game he has taken to a new level of excellence. 
   The Great Dayne, as we all him in Wisconsin, finishes his regular season career with a phenomenal record of 6,397 rushing yards. He has secured himself a lofty place in the history of college football, and a permanent place in the hearts of every Wisconsin Badger fan. As Ron Dayne said about his incredible run into the record books, ``It's kind of sinking in now. This is the best.'' 
   As a Wisconsinite and a dedicated Badger fan, I can tell you that it truly is the best, and that Ron Dayne, the best all-time rusher in college football, is a true Badger hero. 
   Mr. President, On Wisconsin! 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 1999. This bill will abolish the death penalty at the federal level. It will put an immediate halt to executions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations of federal law. 
   Since the beginning of this year, this Chamber has echoed with debate on violence in America. We've heard about violence in our schools and neighborhoods. Some say it's because of the availability of guns to minors. Some say Hollywood has contributed to a culture of violence. Others argue that the roots of the problem are far deeper and more complex. Whatever the causes, a culture of violence has certainly infected our nation. As schoolhouse killings have shown, our children now can be reached by that culture of violence. And they aren't just casual observers; some of them are active participants and many have been victims. 
   But, Mr. President, I'm not so sure that we in government don't contribute to this casual attitude we sometimes see toward killing and death. With each new death penalty statute enacted and each execution carried out, our executive, judicial and legislative branches, at both the state and federal level, add to a culture of violence and killing. With each person executed, we're teaching our children that the way to settle scores is through violence, even to the point of taking a human life. 
   At the same time, the public debate on the death penalty, which was an intense national debate not very long ago, is muted. As the online magazine Slate recently noted, with crime rates down and incomes up, ``unspeakable crimes are no longer spoken of, murder is what happens to your portfolio on a bad day, `family values' are debated through the Internal Revenue code, and the `death penalty' is [often used as a term for] a tax issue.'' What has happened to our nation's sense of striving to do what we know to be the right thing? Those who favor the death penalty should be pressed to explain why fallible human beings should presume to use the power of the state to extinguish the life of a fellow human being on our collective behalf. Those who oppose the death penalty should demand that explanation adamantly, and at every turn. But only a zealous few try. 
   Our nation is a great nation. We have the strongest democracy in the world. We have expended blood and treasure to protect so many fundamental human rights at home and abroad and not always for only our own interests. But we can do better. Mr. President, we should do better. And we should use this moment to do better as we step not only into a new century but also a new millennium, the first such landmark since the depths of the Middle Ages. 
   Courtesy of the Internet and CNN International, the world observes, perplexed and sometimes horrified, the violence in our nation. When the Littleton tragedy erupted, newspapers all over the world marveled at how readily available guns are to American children. And across the globe, with every American who is executed, the entire world watches and asks how can the Americans, the champions of human rights, compromise their own professed beliefs in this way. 
   Religious groups and leaders express their revulsion at the continued practice of capital punishment. Pope John Paul II frequently appeals to American governors when a death row inmate is about to die. I am pleased that in a recent case, involving an inmate on death row in Missouri, the Missouri governor heeded the good advice of the pontiff and commuted the killer's sentence to life without parole. That case generated a lot of press--but only as a political issue, rather than a moral question or a human rights challenge. 
   But the Pope is not standing alone against the death penalty. He is joined by the chorus of voices of various people of faith who abhor the death penalty. Religious groups from the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Mennonites, the Central Conference of American Rabbis, and so many more people of faith have proclaimed their opposition to capital punishment. And, I might add, even conservative Pat ROBERTSon protested the execution in 1998 of Karla Faye Tucker, a born-again Christian on Texas death row. Mr. President, I would like to see the commutation of sentences to life without parole for all death row inmates--whether they are Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, or some other faith, or no faith at all. 
   The United States' casual imposition of capital punishment is abhorrent not only to many people of faith. Our use of the death penalty also stands in stark contrast to the majority of nations that have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. Even Russia and South Africa--nations that for years were symbols of egregious violations of basic human rights and liberties--have seen the error of the use of the death penalty. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the death penalty. And soon, Italy and other European nations are expected to introduce a resolution in the UN General Assembly calling for a worldwide moratorium. 
   The European Union denies membership in their alliance to those nations that use the death penalty. In fact, the European Union recently warned Turkey that if it executes the Kurdish leader, Abdullah Ocalan, Turkey would jeopardize its membership application. Just this past December, the European Union actually passed a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional global abolition of the death penalty, and it specifically called on all states within the United States to abolish the death penalty. This is significant because it reflects the unanimous view of the nations with which the United States enjoys its closest relationships--nations that so often follow our lead. 
   Mr. President, what is even more troubling in the international context is that the United States is now one of only six countries that imposes the death penalty for crimes committed by children. I'll repeat that because it is remarkable. We are one of only six nations on this earth that puts to death people who were under 18 years of age when they committed their crimes. The others are Iran, Pakistan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. These are countries that are often criticized for human rights abuses. And let's look at the numbers. Since 1990, the United States has executed ten child offenders. That's more than any one of these five other countries and equal to all five countries combined. Even China --the country that many members of Congress, including myself, have criticized for its human rights violations--apparently has the decency not to execute its children. This is embarrassing. Is this the kind of company we want to keep? Is this the kind of world leader we want to be? But these are the facts for this past decade, 1990 to the present. 
   Now, let's look at the last two years. In the last two years, the United States has been the only nation in the world to put to death people who were minors when they committed their crimes. We have executed four child offenders during the last two years. Today, over 70 child offenders remain on death row. No one, Mr. President, no one can reasonably argue that based on this data, executing child offenders is a normal or acceptable practice in the world community. And I don't 
   think we should be proud of the fact that the United States is the world leader in the execution of child offenders. 
   Is the death penalty a deterrent for our children's conduct, as well as that  of adult Americans? For those who believe capital punishment is a deterrent, they are sadly, sadly mistaken. The federal government and most states in the U.S. have a death penalty, while our European counterparts do not. Following the logic of death penalty supporters who believe it's a deterrent, you would think that our European allies, who don't use the death penalty, would have a higher murder rate than the United States. Yet, they don't and it's not even close. In fact, the murder rate in the U.S. is six times higher than the murder rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than in Australia, and five times higher than in Sweden. 
   But we don't even need to look across the Atlantic to see that capital punishment has no deterrent effect on crime. Let's compare Wisconsin and Texas. I'm proud of the fact that my great state, Wisconsin, was the first state in this nation to abolish the death penalty completely, when it did so in 1853. Wisconsin has been death penalty-free for nearly 150 years. In contrast, Texas is the most prodigious user of the death penalty, having executed 192 people since 1976. Let's look at the murder rate in Wisconsin and Texas. During the period 1995 to 1998, Texas has had a murder rate that is nearly double the murder rate in Wisconsin. This data alone calls into question the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder. 
   In fact, according to a 1995 Hart Research poll, the majority of our nation's police chiefs do not believe the death penalty is a particularly effective law enforcement tool. When asked to rank the various factors in reducing crime, police chiefs ranked the death penalty last. Rather, the police chiefs --the people who deal with hardened criminals day in and day out --cite reducing drug abuse as the primary factor in reducing crime, along with a better economy and jobs, simplifying court rules, longer prison sentences, more police officers, and reducing guns. It looks like most police chiefs recognize what our European allies and a few states like Wisconsin have known all along: the death penalty is not an effective deterrent. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear. I believe murderers and other violent offenders should be severely punished. I'm not seeking to open the prison doors and let murderers come rushing out into our communities. I don't want to free them. The question is: should the death penalty be a means of punishment in our society? One of the most frequent refrains from death penalty supporters is the claim that the majority of Americans support the death penalty. It's repeated so often, everybody assumes it's true. Mr. President, the facts do not support this claim. Survey after survey, from around the country, shows that when offered sentencing alternatives, more Americans prefer life without parole plus restitution for the victim's family over the death penalty. For example, a 1993 national poll found that when offered alternatives to the death penalty, 44% of Americans supported the alternative of life without parole plus restitution over the death penalty. Only 41% preferred the death penalty and 15% were unsure. This is remarkable. Sure, if you ask Americans the simple, isolated question of whether they support the death penalty, a majority of Americans will agree. But if you ask them whether they support the death penalty or a realistic, practical alternative sentence like life without parole plus restitution, support for the death penalty falls dramatically to below 50%. More Americans support the alternative sentence than Americans who support the death penalty. 
   The fact that our society relies on killing as punishment is disturbing enough. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the States' and federal use of the death penalty is often not consistent with principles of due process, fairness and justice. These principles are the foundation of our criminal justice system and, in a broader sense, the stability of our nation. It is clearer than ever before that we have put innocent people on death row. In addition, those States that have the death penalty are more likely to put people to death for killing white victims than for killing black victims. 
   Mr. President, are we certain that innocent persons are not being executed? Obviously not. Are we certain that racial bias is not infecting the criminal justice system and the administration of the death penalty? I doubt it. 
   It simply cannot be disputed that we are sending innocent people to death. Since the modern death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, we have released 79 men and women from death row. Why? Because they were innocent. Seventy-nine men and women sitting on death row, awaiting a firing squad, lethal injection or electrocution, but later found innocent. That's one death row inmate found innocent for every seven executed. One in seven! That's a pretty poor performance for American justice. A wrong conviction means that the real killer may have gotten away. The real killer may still be on the loose and a threat to society. What an injustice that the victims' loved ones cannot rest because the killer is still not caught. What an injustice that an innocent man or woman has to spend even one day in jail. What a staggering injustice that innocent people are sentenced to death for crimes they did not commit. What a disgrace when we carry out those sentences, actually taking the lives of innocent people in the name of justice. 
   I call my colleagues' attention to the recent example of an Illinois death row inmate, Ronald Jones, who had been sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a Chicago woman. After a lengthy interrogation in which Mr. Jones was beaten by police, he signed a confession. As a class assignment, a group of Northwestern University journalism students researched the case of Ronald Jones. What did they learn? They learned that Mr. Jones was clearly innocent and not for some technical reason--he just didn't do it. As a result of the students' efforts, Mr. Jones was later exonerated based on DNA evidence. Mr. President, our criminal justice system sent an innocent man to death row. Mr. Jones was tried and convicted in a justice system that is sometimes far from just and that sometimes just gets it wrong. And Mr. Jones is not alone. In Illinois alone, three death row inmates so far this year have been proven innocent. Since 1987, Illinois has freed 12 inmates from death row because they were later found innocent. 
   Innocent, Mr. President, and they were sitting on death row. Innocent, and yet they were about to be killed. Why? Because our criminal justice system is sometimes far from fair and far from just. We can all agree that it is profoundly wrong to convict and condemn innocent people to death. But sadly, that's what's happening. With the greater accuracy and sophistication of DNA testing available today compared to even a couple of years ago, states like Illinois are finding that people sitting on death row did not commit the crimes to which earlier, less accurate DNA tests appeared to link them. This DNA technology should be further reviewed and compared to other tests. We should consider the role of DNA tests in all those committed to death row. 
   Some argue that the discovery of the innocence of a death row inmate proves that the system works. This is absurd. How can you say the criminal justice system works when a group of students--not lawyers or investigators but students with no special powers, who were very much outside the system--discover that a man about to be executed was in fact innocent? That's what happened in Illinois to Ronald Jones. The system doesn't work. It has failed us. 
   A primary reason why justice has been less than just is a series of Supreme Court decisions that seem to fail to grasp the significance and responsibility of their task when a human life is at stake. The Supreme Court has been narrowly focused on procedural technicalities, ignoring the fact that the death penalty is a unique punishment that cannot be undone to correct mistakes. One disturbing decision was issued by the Supreme Court just a few months ago. In Jones v. United States, which involved an inmate on death row in Texas and the interpretation of the 1994 Federal Death Penalty Act, the judge refused to tell the jury that if they deadlocked on the sentence, the law required the judge to impose a sentence of life without possibility of parole. As a result, some jurors were under the grave misunderstanding that lack of unanimity would mean the judge could give a sentence where the  defendant might one day go free. The Supreme Court, however, upheld the lower court's imposition of the death penalty. And one more person will lose a life, when a simple correction of a misunderstanding could have resulted in a severe yet morally correct sentence of life without parole. 
   As legal scholar Ronald Dworkin recently observed, ``[t]he Supreme Court has become impatient, and super due process has turned into due process-lite. Its impatience is understandable, but is also unacceptable.'' Mr. President, America's impatience with the protracted appeals of death row inmates is understandable. But this impatience is unacceptable. The rush to judgment is unacceptable. And the rush to execute men, women and children who might well be innocent is horrifying. 
   The discovery of the innocence of death row inmates and misguided Supreme Court decisions disallowing potentially dispositive exculpatory evidence, however, aren't the only reasons we need to abolish the death penalty. Another reason we need to abolish the death penalty is the continuing racism in our criminal justice system. Our nation is facing a crucial test. A test of moral and political will. We have come a long way through this nation's history, and especially in this century, to dismantle state-sponsored and societal racism. Brown v. Board of Education, ensuring the right to equal educational opportunities for whites and blacks, was decided only 45 years ago. Unfortunately, however, we are still living with vestiges of institutional racism. In some cases, racism can be found at every stage of a capital trial--in the selection of jurors, during the presentation of evidence, when the prosecutor contrasts the race of the victim and defendant to appeal to the prejudice of the jury, and sometimes during jury deliberations. 
   After the 1976 Supreme Court Gregg decision upholding the use of the death penalty, the death penalty was first enacted as a sentence at the federal level with passage of the Drug Kingpin Statute in 1988. Since that time, numerous additional federal crimes have become death penalty-eligible, bringing the total to about 60 statutes today. At the federal level, 21 people have been sentenced to death. Another eight men sit on the military's death row. Of those 21 defendants on the federal government's death row, 14 are black and only 5 are white. One defendant is Hispanic and another Asian. That means 16 of the 21 people on federal death row are minorities. That's just over 75%. And the numbers are worse on the military's death row. Seven of the eight, or 87.5%, on military death row are minorities. 
   Some of my colleagues may remember the debates of the late 1980's and early 1990's, when Congress considered the Racial Justice Act and other attempts to eradicate racism in the use of capital punishment. A noted study evaluating the role of race in death penalty cases was frequently discussed. This was the study by David Baldus, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law. The Baldus study found that defendants who kill white victims are more than four times more likely to be sent to death row than defendants who kill black victims. An argument against the Baldus study was made by some opponents of the Racial Justice Act. They argued that we just needed to ``level up'' the playing field. In other words, send all the defendants who killed black victims to death row, too. They argued that legislative remedies were not needed, just tell prosecutors and judges to go after perpetrators of black homicide as strongly as against perpetrators of white homicide. 
   In theory, this may sound reasonable but one thing is clear: no matter how hard we try, we cannot overcome the inevitable fallibility of being human. That fallibility means that we will not be able to apply the death penalty in a fair and just manner. We will always run the risk that we will condemn innocent people to death. Mr. President, let's restore some certainty, fairness, and justice to our criminal justice system. Let's have the courage to recognize our human fallibilities. Let's put a halt to capital punishment. 
   The American Bar Association agrees. In 1997, the American Bar Association called for a moratorium on the death penalty because it found that the application of the death penalty raises fairness and due process concerns. Several states are finally beginning to recognize the great injustice when the ultimate punishment is carried out in a biased and unfair way. Moratoriums have been considered by the legislatures of at least ten states over the last several months. The legislatures of Illinois and Nebraska have made the most progress. They actually passed moratorium measures earlier this year. 
   I am glad to see that some states are finally taking steps to correct the practice of legalized killing that was again unleashed by the Supreme Court's Gregg decision in 1976. The first post-Gregg execution took place in 1977 in Utah, when Gary Gilmore did not challenge and instead aggressively sought his execution by a firing squad. The first post-Gregg involuntary execution took place on May 25, 1979. I vividly remember that day. I had just finished my last law school exam that morning. Later that day, I recall turning on the television and watching the news report that Florida had just executed John Spenkelink. I was overcome with a sickening feeling. Here I was, fresh out of law school and firm in my belief that our legal system was advancing through the latter quarter of the twentieth century. Instead, to my great dismay, I was witnessing a throwback to the electric chair, the gallows, and the routine executions of our nation's earlier history. 
   Mr. President, I haven't forgotten that experience or what I thought and felt on that day. At the end of 1999, at the end of a remarkable century and millennium of progress, I cannot help but believe that our progress has been tarnished with our nation's not only continuing, but increasing use of the death penalty. As of today, the United States has executed 584 people since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. In those 23 years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of executions. This year the United States has already set a record for the most executions in our country in one year, 84--the latest execution being that of Thomas Lee Royal, Jr., who was executed by lethal injection just last night by the state of Virginia. And the year isn't even over yet. We are on track to hit close to 100 executions this year. This is astounding and it is embarrassing. We are a nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. We are one of the first nations to speak out against torture and killings by foreign governments. It is time for us to look in the mirror. 
   Two former Supreme Court justices did just that. Justice Harry Blackmun penned the following eloquent dissent in 1994: 
   From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have endeavored--indeed, I have struggled--along with a majority of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle the Court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty experiment has failed. It is virtually self-evident to me now that no combination of procedural rules or substantive regulations ever can save the death penalty from its inherent constitutional deficiencies. The basic question--does the system accurately and consistently determine which defendants ``deserve'' to die?--cannot be answered in the affirmative. . . . The problem is that the inevitability of factual, legal, and moral error gives us a system that we know must wrongly kill some defendants, a system that fails to deliver the fair, consistent, and reliable sentences of death required by the Constitution.  
   Justice Lewis Powell also had a similar change of mind. Justice Powell dissented from the Furman decision in 1972, which struck down the death penalty as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. He also wrote the decision in McCleskey v. Kemp in 1987, which denied a challenge to the death penalty on the grounds that it was applied in a discriminatory manner against African Americans. In 1991, however, Justice Powell told his biographer that he had decided that capital punishment should be abolished. 
   After sitting on our nation's highest court for over 20 years, Justices Blackmun and Powell came to understand the randomness and unfairness of the death penalty. Mr. President, it is time for our nation to follow the lead of these two distinguished jurists and  re-visit its support for this form of punishment. 
   At the end of 1999, as we enter a new millennium, our society is still far from fully just. The continued use of the death penalty demeans us. The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is immoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right,'' could not be more appropriate here. Our nation has long ago done away with other barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of suspected criminals. Just as our nation did away with these punishments as contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death penalty as we enter the next century. And it's not just a matter of morality. Mr. President, the continued viability of our justice system as a truly just system requires that we do so. And in the world's eyes, the ability of our nation to say truthfully that we are the leader and defender of freedom, liberty and equality demands that we do so. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing the death penalty in our great nation. Today, I introduce a bill that abolishes the death penalty at the federal level. I call on all states that have the death penalty to also cease this practice. Let us step away from the culture of violence and restore fairness and integrity to our criminal justice system. I close with this reminder to my colleagues. Where would our nation be if members of Congress were followers, not leaders, of public opinion? We, of course, would still be living with slavery, segregation and without a woman's right to vote. Like abolishing slavery and segregation and establishing a woman's right to vote, abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take patience, persistence and courage. As we head into the next millennium, let us leave this archaic practice behind.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support efforts to increase the federal minimum wage by adopting the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1999. This important amendment will provide American laborers with a 50-cent increase to the minimum wage on January 1, 2000, and a second 50-cent increase on January 1, 2001. This modest increase, which would raise the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour, will help more than 11 million lower income Americans. 
   Our country's economy is growing. Its economic vitality and the changes wrought by welfare reform have resulted in a better life for many working people--unless those workers are minimum wage workers, anchored to the bottom of the wage scale. 
   The truth is, even though the economy is roaring, wages at the bottom are stagnant, and hard-working people are still living in poverty. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in the mid-1990s, there were 89,000 working poor families with children in Wisconsin. Seventy-four percent of those families had at least one working parent. And sixty-nine percent of these families had at least one working parent and still required some form of public assistance. In this time of a booming economy and low unemployment, these statistics are very troubling. Mr. President, the majority of the poor people of our country are working--the problem is that many of them are holding down low-paying jobs with stagnant wages that do not allow them to finally break free from poverty. 
   Despite successes in the welfare to work initiative, a 1998 U.S. Conference of Mayors study, entitled ``A Status Report on Hunger and Homelessness in American Cities,'' indicates that seventy-eight percent of the 30 major U.S. cities surveyed reported an increased demand for emergency food assistance. Thirty-seven percent of those people seeking food at soup kitchens and shelters in 1998 were employed. City officials surveyed listed low-paying jobs as the top cause of hunger in their cities. It is an undeniable disgrace that, in many cases, minimum wage workers cannot afford to feed themselves or their families. 
   Mr. President, no hard working American should have to worry about affording groceries, shoes for their kids, or medicines. The people this amendment will help are not people who spend their money frivolously. These are the families who scrimp and save to provide their children with the necessities of life: a decent place to live, enough to eat, clothes on their back, a decent education, and some hope for a better future. 
   The study, ``The State of Working Wisconsin--1998,'' by the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, contains some troubling news regarding wages. The Wisconsin median hourly wage is still eight-point-four percent below its 1979 level. Since 1979, Wisconsin's median wage has declined fifty percent faster than the five-point-three percent national decline over the same period. These numbers are, sadly, not unique to Wisconsin. This is the situation all over the country. 
   And this is the situation that the Kennedy amendment will help to address. According to the Economic Policy Institute, more than 205,000 workers in my home state of Wisconsin, or fifteen-point-one percent of Wisconsin's workforce, will benefit from the modest increase in this amendment. Those are real people, Mr. President. Real people who deserve this modest raise in pay for the work they do to support their families and to keep the American economy moving. 
   Opponents of this increase argue that it will hurt the economy. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the 1996 and 1997 raises in the minimum wage had a positive impact on the economy. Unemployment has dropped to four-point-one percent, the lowest mark in three decades. Nine-point-one million new jobs have been created. And there is no reason to believe that this proposed increase will not have the same result. In fact, history shows that minimum wage increases have not had a negative impact on unemployment. 
   This modest increase of 50 cents per year is really not a hike at all after inflation--over the next two years it will simply restore the real value of the minimum wage to its 1982 level. So by the time the second installment of this proposed increase would go into effect, the buying power of workers scraping by on the minimum wage will be only what is was when Ronald Reagan was a new president. Meanwhile, wages at the high levels have been climbing steadily while the real value of the minimum wage has eroded. 
   I urge my colleagues to begin to restore some respect for the dignity of work to the federal minimum wage. The lowest paid workers in America's labor force deserve a chance to earn a decent living and we need to give them the tools. I urge every Senator to support the Kennedy amendment. It is a vote to reward work and to support every American worker.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the managers for offering and accepting the bipartisan amendment that would allow courts to waive the filing fee for chapter 7 filers who cannot afford to pay. This is similar to an amendment that Senator SPECTER and I successfully offered on the floor in the last Congress. I am certain we could have repeated that success on this bill, but I did not think it was necessary this year to have a rollcall vote since the House-passed bankruptcy bill includes a similar provision. 
   It is unbelievable to me that bankruptcy is the only Federal civil proceeding in which a poor person cannot file in forma pauperis. That means that in any other federal civil proceeding you can file a case without paying the filing fee if the court determines that you are unable to afford the fee, but in bankruptcy you either pay the filing fee or you are denied access to the system. 
   That doesn't make any sense. The bankruptcy system, is by definition designed to assist those who have fallen on hard times, but because there is no allowance for in forma pauperis filing, the system is unavailable to the poorest of the poor. This prohibition against debtors filing in forma pauperis is a clear obstacle to the poor gaining access to justice. 
   Currently the filing fee for consumer bankruptcy is $175, and it may well be increased in this bill. That's roughly the weekly take home pay of an employee working a 40-hour week at the minimum wage. It is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect the indigent--people who barely get by from week to week, the very people who truly need the protection afforded by the bankruptcy system the most--to save money to raise such a fee simply to enter the system. 
   Congress has already acknowledged that the bankruptcy system may need an in forma pauperis proceeding by enacting a three year pilot program in six judical districts across the country. The Federal Judicial Center recently submitted a comprehensive report to Congress analyzing this pilot program in which it found that: 
   A fee waiver application was filed in only 3.4 percent of all chapter 7 cases, and the large majority of these waivers were granted. Indeed, the U.S. Trustees Office filed objections to less than 1 percent of the applications. In other words, only those very few individuals who really needed the fee-waiver applied for it. 
   The fee-waiver program enhanced access to the bankruptcy system for indigent single women above and beyond any other group. We cannot strike another blow against single mothers and their children by denying them access to the bankruptcy system because they cannot even afford the filing fee. 
   The nature of the debt for those who filed for the fee-waiver differed from that of other debtors in that their debts related more to basic subsistence--education, health, utility services, and housing. Moreover, 63 percent of the housing-related debts of those who filed for the fee-waiver owed their debts to public housing authorities. Therefore, these indigent debtors were not filing bankruptcy to escape paying for their boats, or their fancy entertainment systems. They were filing bankruptcy merely to subsist. 
   Often times the bankruptcy system was the only thing that stood between these unfortunate people and homelessness. 
   There was only a minimal increase in the number of filings and there was no indication that debtors filed for chapter 7 rather than chapter 13 just to obtain the benefit of the fee-waiver program. Simply stated, the debtors did not abuse the system. 
   In sum, this amendment would build upon the strong foundation established in the pilot program and direct the Judicial Center to create a nation-wide in forma pauperis program for the bankruptcy system, thus, establishing some fairness in the bankruptcy filing process for the most financially strapped debtors. 
   We have made one modification in the amendment to make sure that in forma pauperis filing status is only available to truly indigent people, namely those with an annual income of below 125% of the poverty level. That is the same income qualification required for people to receive free legal assistance from the Legal Service Corporation. Obviously, we don't intend for the bankruptcy filing fee to be waived for people who aren't really poor. So I was happy to agree to this modification. 
   The expenditure of funds required by this amendment is clearly justified. We made the decision long ago in this country that our judicial system would be open to everyone--those who can pay, and those who cannot--and we decided that as a nation, we would absorb the cost of allowing those who could not pay to receive the same access as those who could. If you are poor, and you cannot afford the fee to file for divorce, we absorb the cost. If someone does you wrong and you cannot afford the filing fee to sue, we absorb the cost. Likewise, if you are in such financial difficulty that you must file for bankruptcy, and you cannot afford the filing fee, now, because of this amendment, we must also absorb the cost. 
   In this bill, where we are giving such advantages to the well-heeled landlords and credit companies, I am pleased that we will take this small step to ensure that the poorest of the poor are not shut out of this very important part of our system of justice. Again, I thank the managers for agreeing to this amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment would limit the reach of section 311 of the bill, which I believe is far too broad. I think it is too harsh a solution for the limited abuse that its sponsors say they are trying to address. 
   Since the Bankruptcy Code was enacted, the automatic stay that becomes effective upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition has always prohibited a landlord from evicting a tenant unless the landlord obtains permission from the bankruptcy court--what is called ``relief from the stay.'' The stay serves several purposes. In chapter 13, a tenant has a right to assume a lease and to cure a default by paying the accumulated back rent. In chapter 7, the stay was intended to provide the debtor a short ``breathing spell.'' Breathing room is especially helpful to debtors who want to remain in their homes. In many cases, when a chapter 7 debtor is relieved of other debts, he or she can use this brief period to catch up on the rent and avoid eviction. 
   The right to avoid eviction by filing bankruptcy is obviously of great importance to tenants who at the very point when they have undertaken the difficult and draining bankruptcy experience would otherwise suffer the additional hardships of moving and having to find new housing. And then you have tenants in rent-controlled or rent-stabilized apartments, who lose valuable property rights if they are evicted. Of course, an eviction would normally doom any hope of the tenant completing a chapter 13 repayment plan or getting much benefit from the fresh start bankruptcy is intended to provide. 
   I understand that the applicability of the automatic stay to eviction proceedings has come under attack because of abuses. This is primarily due to the practice of debtors in a few cities, especially Los Angeles, of filing bankruptcy cases, sometimes repeatedly, solely for the purpose of delaying eviction and, in effect, ``living rent free.'' these debtors are often aided by nonattorney bankruptcy petition preparers and file pro se. I have seen the advertisements by some of these unscrupulous individuals, and I deplore this kind of abuse as much as anyone does. 
   But to address this limited problem of abuse, what S. 625 does is totally eliminate the automatic stay for tenants. 
   In fact, the bill contains an even more sweeping provision than the language adopted in the conference report last year and contained in the House bill this year. 
   The problem of abusive bankruptcy filings by tenants in a few jurisdictions can be addressed by more limited, carefully targeted provisions. 
   First, we can cut a whole area of abuse by simply lifting the stay in cases where there are repeat bankruptcy filings. My amendment includes that. These abuses inspired this amendment and they also point to its underlying goal: to eliminate the possibility that debtors can use the bankruptcy law to live ``recent free'' after they file. I agree that we should not let tenants take advantage of the bankruptcy laws to live ``rent free.'' But if a debtor is able to put together enough money to pay rent during the pendency of the bankruptcy, that goal is satisfied. Certainly, the landlord is not losing anything financially by allowing the tenant to stay. 
   If the landlord again begins collecting rent on the apartment after a bankruptcy filing, it is in the same position as it would be if it evicted the debtor and began collecting rent from a new tenant. So under my amendment, relief from the automatic stay is only available if the debtor fails to pay rent that comes due after the bankruptcy filing. 
   I also believe that it is important to keep the bankruptcy court involved and aware of the lifting of the stay as it is under current law when a landlord applies for relief from the stay. There does seems to be good reason, however, to provide expedited relief from the stay if the debtor does not pay rent while the proceeding is pending. 
   So my amendment creates a simple and straightforward process. Once a debtor misses a rent payment after filing for bankruptcy, the landlord can immediately file a certification with the court that the payment has not been received. It must also serve a copy of the certification on the debtor, to make sure that the debtor is aware that the landlord intends to seek to have the stay lifted. After that certification is filed and served, the debtor has 15 days to cure the default. The exemption from the stay will become effective 15 days after the certification is filed and served, unless the court orders otherwise. And one reason for the court to order otherwise is that the rent has been paid. 
   This certification and expedited exemption process also applies to evictions based on property damage or illegal drug use. By giving discretion to the court to delay or stop the eviction proceeding from going forward, the amendment protects against these provisions being abused by landlords. We don't want landlords alleging property damage for the most minor scratches on the wall in order to take advantage of these expedited procedures. 
   The expedited procedures also apply to one other situation, which the Senator from Alabama raised during our consideration of this amendment in the 
   Judiciary Committee. The Senator from Alabama sketched out a hypothetical situation where a landlord who has rented his or her own house or apartment to someone wants to move back in after the expiration of the lease. Under the amendment that I offered in committee, the landlord could theoretically be prevented from moving back in to his or her own house if the tenant files for bankruptcy and keeps paying rent. 
   I think the Senator from Alabama raised a good point in committee, so I have addressed it in this amendment. Again, the underlying goal is to allow tenants the benefits of the automatic stay as long as landlords are no worse off. In the usual case of a landlord who would simply rent to someone else after an eviction, renewed and continuous payment of rent after the bankruptcy filing protects the financial interests of the landlord. But in the case sketched out by the Senator from Alabama, landlords have other rights, namely the right to reoccupy their own homes, that we need to protect as well. 
   So my amendment contains an additional circumstance in which a landlord can seek expedited relief from the stay--when the lease has expired according to its terms and the landlord intends to occupy the property after the eviction. Once again, the landlord must simply certify that these circumstances exist and 15 days later, the stay is lifted, unless the tenant demonstrates to the court that the certification is erroneous. 
   It should be remembered that this amendment does not effect the landlord's ability to seek relief from the stay under the procedures provided by current law. Expedited procedures are available for nonpayment of rent after filing for bankruptcy, for evictions based on property damage or drug use, or when a lease has expired and the landlord wishes to reoccupy the property. For all other types of evictions, the landlord may continue to pursue remedies under current law. 
   As in so many parts of our debate on this bill, the main issue is balance. To the extent there are abuses they should be addressed, but the solutions should be narrowly targeted so that they do not eliminate the rights of honest debtors who need the fresh start that bankruptcy is designed to provide. In this case, I truly believe that the solution is S. 625 for the problem that landlords say they are concerned about goes too far. I am not comfortable with provisions that would kick people out of their apartments even if they can pay rent during the time that they are trying to get their financial house in order. To me that is not constructive, it is punitive. It is not really helping landlords, it is just punishing people who may be trying their very best to keep their heads above water. Shame on us, if we can't see that. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this modest and balanced amendment. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 2748 be laid aside.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak generally on the bankruptcy legislation that is now before the Senate. 
   First, I praise my friend and colleague from Illinois who has, on all issues, been extremely dedicated, hard-working, and effective on this bankruptcy issue. This is an important  issue and a complex area of the law that has an impact on millions of Americans and, of course, on businesses all across the country. 
   This is an important debate, and I expect we will be on the floor for some time, because many of us have serious concerns about this bill and expect to offer quite a number of amendments to try to improve it. 
   As I said, the issues raised by bankruptcy legislation are extremely complicated. The stakes are high. The different viewpoints are passionately expressed by all of the players involved, from the different types of creditors to bankruptcy judges, trustees, and practitioners, to consumers and potential debtors. 
   We have a long legislative history to contend with here. We have been working on bankruptcy reform legislation for some time now, beginning with the appointment of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in 1994, and the issuance of the commission's report in 1997. In the last Congress, the Senate passed reform legislation by an overwhelming margin. That bill was itself a compromise among the various interests. But a conference committee sent a much different, much more one-sided bill back to us, and I am happy to say, that bill died at the end of the session. 
   My view is that the legislation before us is only slightly less objectionable than the legislation that came out of conference last year. S. 625 is not a balanced piece of legislation. It tilts the scales too far in favor of certain types of creditors, and denies reasonable protections of the law not just to those trying unfairly to evade financial obligations they really can afford to meet, but also to honest hardworking families and single parents, who have come upon hard times and need the fresh start and breathing room that our bankruptcy system offers to give them a chance to survive. In too many cases, I am afraid, that will hinder families' ability to meet other obligations, particularly their obligations to their own children and to local taxing authorities. 
   In many ways, this is a bill at war with itself. Many of the provisions are designed to shift more money into the hands of unsecured creditors, while other provisions are designed to shift that same pot of money back to car lenders and different unsecured creditors. The bill is supposedly intended to move more debtors from the complete discharge of debts available under chapter 7 of the code into chapter 13 repayment plans. But chapter 13 trustees and others have testified that many provisions in the bill will decrease the success of chapter 13 repayment. The bill supposedly increases personal responsibility, and yet it would favor people who have two new cars over people who own older cars or who take public transportation. And the bill is said to be aimed at deadbeats and abusers of the system, not honest but financially troubled low-income people, and yet it penalizes renters, as opposed to homeowners. And whereas we often try to promote small business entrepreneurship in legislation, in this bill we sometimes seem to impose stricter rules on small businesses than we do on large businesses. 
   So, does the Senate really want to endorse these policies? Is it really our goal to send these mixed messages? I urge my colleagues to pay close attention to this very important debate. We do a lot in this body that in the end seems to just be symbolic. This bill is not symbolism. We cannot simply pass this bill and say we have struck a blow for personal responsibility. Because this bill will have real consequences in the real lives of real people. And I fear that in too many cases those consequences will be very damaging. 
   I do want to comment for a moment on the process that has brought us here. I mentioned before that the Senate considered bankruptcy legislation in the last Congress. But in this Congress, we didn't have a single hearing on this bill. Let me repeat that because it is so disturbing for a bill of this magnitude and complexity. The Senate Judiciary Committee did not have a single hearing on bankruptcy reform or S. 625--not one. 
   Now, to be fair, there was one joint hearing that was held over at the House with two subcommittees of jurisdiction--one hearing. And it occurred on a day that Senators happened to be involved in a very long series of votes--I believe it was one of our so-called ``vote-arama'' sessions--which meant that none of the Senators on the subcommittee could take advantage of the lone opportunity for public discussion of this bill. Other than that one hearing, the Senate of the United States had no hearings whatsoever on bankruptcy reform this year. 
   I did not understand the rush to report this bill from committee without hearings, and I still don't. Why didn't we hear from the bankruptcy judges, and the trustees, and the disinterested academics, and the practitioners about how and whether this bill will work? Why didn't we get their views in a formal and considered way, and try to address their concerns? 
   To say that this bill is just a repeat of last year's bankruptcy debate is just not right. This legislation is far too complicated and far too reaching to make that facile claim. This bill is actually different from last year's Senate bill in more ways than it is similar. In many ways, it is a brand new piece of legislation for this body. Last year's Senate bill was almost exclusively consumer bankruptcy oriented. This bill not only takes a different approach to consumer bankruptcy, but it has dozens of provisions affecting a variety of tax issues, municipal bankruptcy cases, single asset real estate cases, small business cases, and health care cases, in addition to a host of changes to general chapter 11 bankruptcy that may dramatically change the rules governing the reorganization of our Nation's largest businesses. We never discussed 
   most of these issues at the committee level. We have received many warning signs from those who understand the bankruptcy system far better than any of us do. I am afraid to say, what is being done here is actually irresponsible. 
   Why has this happened? Well, the sad truth is that all of us know why. A very wealthy and powerful industry has pushed and pushed and pushed for this bill, and so far the Congress has ignored the experts and done the industry's bidding. The credit card industry wants this reform because it wants protection from its own excesses. You see, the industry has flooded the mailboxes, and the phones, and the e-mail in boxes of America with offers of easy credit. Americans received over 3.45 billion credit card solicitations in 1998. Anyone can get a credit cared, even children, even people who have just filed for bankruptcy. 
   I favor empowering citizens and broadening their options using credit to bring more convenience to their lives as consumers. But the industry has been irresponsible in extending credit to those who cannot handle it. And now the industry has come to Congress for help. Now the industry wants the bankruptcy system to protect it. I say to you, Mr. President, that is not right. 
   The industry hasn't come to us hat in hand, however. It has come with an open checkbook. As you know, Mr. President, from time to time on the floor in recent months, I have noted that contributions of different players in the legislative process that seek to influence our work here with campaign contributions. This bill is a poster child for the ``Calling of the Bankroll.'' 
   Like so many issues, bankruptcy reform has been transformed from a policy debate to a vehicle for a special interest agenda. The key ingredient in that transformation is money, plain and simple. 
   In the last election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, the members of the National Consumer Bankruptcy Coalition, an industry lobbying group made up of the major credit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard and associations representing the Nation's big banks and retailers, gave nearly $4.5 million in contributions to parties and candidates. 
   How can a single mother in West Allis, WI, for example, who faces overwhelming debt from medical bills and the loss of child support, compete with the might and financial power of this industry? Her family, and her future will be affected by this bill every bit as much as the credit industry, yet she is not represented in the campaign finance game. And I am afraid that this bill in its current form very much reflects her lack of power. 
   Some of the campaign contributions from these companies seem to be carefully timed to have a maximum effect. 
   It is very hard to argue that the financial largess of this industry has nothing to do with its interest in our consideration of bankruptcy legislation. For example, on the very day that the House passed the conference report last year and sent it to the Senate, MBNA Corporation gave a $200,000 soft money contribution to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 
   In connection with the joint hearing that was held earlier this year, I submitted a written question to Bruce Hammond, the chief operating officer of MBNA. I asked him about the $200,000 contribution to the NRSC in October 9, 1998, just days after the conference committee reached agreement on a version of this bill that everyone agreed was more favorable to the credit card companies than the bill that the Senate had passed. 
   This is what I asked him:

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President. In a moment I am going to offer an amendment to address one of the many unfairnesses of the means test in this bill. This amendment is focused particularly on expenses that a family might incur because it is paying for medical care for a non-dependent family member. 
   These kinds of expenses often are referred to in our discussions as expenses for long term care. Long-term care, and particularly fundamental long-term care reform, has been a special focus of mine since I was first elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1982. 
   As I discovered when I began working on this many years ago, long-term care is greatly misunderstood. Even today, when people hear long-term care many think of nursing homes and the elderly. 
   But that is not the whole story. 
   According to the Long-Term Care Campaign, while the majority of the over 11 million severely disabled Americans needing long-term care services are elderly, nearly half are either working-age adults or children. 
   And while many do receive their long-term care services in a nursing home, the vast majority of those needing long-term care receive that care at home. 
   Long-term care touches many more than just those needing services. 
   Nearly 6 of every 10 Americans have already experienced a long-term care problem in their own family or through a friend, and more than half of these have provided care to someone who needs services. 
   The National Family Caregivers Association estimates that between 80 and 90 percent of all long-term care is provided by families. 
   Caregiving can be an enormous burden on families--physically, emotionally, and financially. 
   As we found in Wisconsin two decades ago, that burden not only takes its toll on families, but on government budgets and taxpayers since all too often the reason an individual enters a nursing home is not due to their condition, but because the family member caregiver is simply no longer able to care for them. 
   Though I will not speak at length today about the reforms we need to make to our long-term care system, I do want to note this critical point--we need to build on the informal long-term care that families already provide, not only to allow those needing long-term care services to remain where they prefer, at home with their family, but also because the alternative places a huge burden on State and Federal budgets. 
   Families that provide personal assistance and other forms of care to  loved ones not only help that loved one, they help the taxpayer. 
   Families provide an estimated $200 billion in long-term care services every year--services that help keep loved ones at home, and out of expensive institutional settings. 
   But when families are no longer able for physical, emotional, or financial reasons to care for that loved one, changes are that individual will end up in a nursing home on the joint State-Federal program Medicaid. 
   When taxpayers pick up the Medicaid tab for nursing home care, it isn't cheap. 
   According to the Long-term Care Campaign, nursing homes cost an average of $46,000 a year, and for those with severe disabilities or dementia, the costs can be even greater. 
   Mr. President, much as I might like to, we can't use this bankruptcy bill to reform our long-term care system. But at the very least, we should not be making the current long-term care crisis worse than it already is. And that, I fear, is exactly what the bill in its current form does. 
   In particular, we should not be discouraging families from caring for a disabled or chronically ill loved one. 
   If a family facing financial difficulties can continue to care for a loved one at home, and keep them out of more expensive taxpayer-funded settings, all of us will benefit. 
   It is for that reason that I offer this amendment--to make sure that a family's ongoing expenses to provide care for a loved one will be recognized as reasonable and legitimate living expenses for purposes of calculating how much a family is capable of contributing toward repayment of debt. 
   The means test in the bill provides that a debtors are ineligible for a Chapter 7 discharge if they can supposedly repay 25 percent of their debts or $15,000, which ever is less, over a period of 5 years. Basically, the trustee has to analyze the ability of debtors to repay their debts, looking at their monthly income and their monthly expenses. But the expenses are not actual expenses, they are the expenses set out in IRS standards designed for a wholly different purpose. And these standards do not include as necessary expenses amounts paid for the care of non-dependent family members. 
   So people who file for bankruptcy are presumed to have abused the system if they don't meet the means test using the IRS standards. And they can rebut that presumption only by showing special circumstances that justify additional expenses. 
   To do so, they have to provide documentation and ``a detailed explanation of the circumstances that makes the expenses necessary and reasonable.'' So under this bill, debtors with significant long term care expenses are deemed abusers of the system, and they may have to litigate to prove that they are not spending too much to care for their family. The bankruptcy courts are going to be called on to pass judgment on whether the expenses for long term care are reasonable. Some people may be forced to forgo bankruptcy because they cannot afford to both hire a lawyer to fight the presumption of abuse and continue to care for their family members. 
   This is only one of many examples of how use of the IRS standards makes the means test draconian and unfair. I hope as we debate and amend this bill we will make major changes in how this means test operates. And we should start here, with long term care expenses. This amendment simply provides that the monthly expenses to be analyzed under the means test may include the continuation of actual expenses paid by the debtor for the care of household or immediate family members who are not dependent. 
   Let's think about the alternative for a moment. Imagine a scenario where someone is in the position of filing for bankruptcy and has significant long term care expenses of a aging parent that are for some reason deemed to be not reasonable. If that individual is prevented from filing for bankruptcy, the need for the long term care doesn't go away. It stays. It may be the reason that the person has to file for bankruptcy in the first place, because the additional burden of the long term care expenses makes it impossible to make ends meet and keep up with payments on accumulated debt. 
   What choice does this person have if the protection of the bankruptcy laws is unavailable? No choice at all. The care must stop, and the person being cared for goes into a public institution with higher costs to the taxpayers and, more important, untold damage to the family. 
   I challenge my colleagues to tell us how the simple exception to the rigid IRS standards set out in this amendment will lead to abuse. Are people going to go out and arrange for unreasonably extravagant care for their family members in order to file for bankruptcy and get out of debt? I don't think so. In fact, I think it is insulting. 
   No, the millions of Americans who selflessly care for their loved ones make a sacrifice that we should honor and encourage. Passing this amendment would be a small step toward recognizing that crucial service to our country that they provide. I urge my colleagues to step back from the misery that this bill might very well inflict and adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside so I may offer this amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, after years of persistent lobbying and a flood of political donations, three industries may soon have a lot to celebrate--the  insurance, banking and securities industries will have a huge victory if we pass this conference report today. 
   I do want to note that some of those Senators who helped to craft this legislation are among the very best Members of the Senate. 
   While I oppose this measure, I certainly commend them for their dedication and hard work on this bill. 
   Nevertheless, with this legislation, this Congress is declaring the ultimate bank holiday--giving banks, insurance companies and securities firms a permanent vacation from the Glass-Steagall Act and other Depression-era banking law reforms. 
   Advocates of this legislation will tell you that it is terrific for consumers, offering them one-stop shopping for all their financial and insurance needs. 
   But the reality is far more complicated and far less appealing--it is likely to cause a merger-mania in the industry that could severely limit consumer choice and spur a rise in banking fees. 
   This conference report also raises serious issues about consumer privacy. Privacy advocates worry that it will give bankers, insurers and securities firms virtually unlimited license to share account data and other sensitive information. 
   To top it all off, this legislation undermines the Community Reinvestment Act. 
   Higher bank fees, reduced consumer choice and fewer protections for low-income loan assistance--these don't sound very good to most consumers, Mr. President. But they sound good to the industries that will benefit from this legislation. This conference report is music to the ears of the industries that have been lobbying for these changes for decades. 
   And this lobbying campaign has left a trail of political contributions that is nothing short of stunning. A recent study by Common Cause put the political contributions of these special interests at $187.2 million in the last ten years. 
   That is why I am going to take this opportunity to Call the Bankroll. This lobbying effort for so-called financial services modernization is truly breathtaking, because it combines the clout of three industries that on their own are giants in the campaign finance system, particularly the soft money system. 
   Together the power of their combined pocketbooks were a powerful force propelling this legislation through Congress. 
   One of these industries, the securities and investment industry is a legendary soft money donor, and I will just highlight a few such firms that have lobbied on behalf of this legislation. 
   Merrill Lynch has long called for banking deregulation. The company, its subsidiaries and executives gave more than $310,000 in soft money during the 1998 election cycle. 
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which gave more than $145,000 in soft money in 1997 and 1998, was also a key part of the lobbying team on this issue. In fact the Washington Post reported that the company's chairman, along with several other corporate heads, made calls to White House officials the very night the conference hammered out an agreement on this bill. 
   Lobbyists lined the halls outside the room where the conference met to reconcile the House and Senate version of the bill, and as we know, that is standard procedure on Capitol Hill. 
   As usual, corporate lobbyists lined the halls, while the consumers who will bear the impact--and consumer advocates agree it will be an adverse impact--of this bill, were left out in the cold. 
   The banking industry was also there that night, of course, since this legislation is a bonanza for them too, revolutionizing the kinds of services that banks can offer. 
   Citigroup was there, and so was the presence of the more than $720,000 that Citigroup and its executives and subsidiaries gave in soft money to the political parties in the 1998 election cycle. 
   That is a huge sum, Mr. President, especially for an election cycle in which there was not even a presidential election. 
   And in the current election cycle Citigroup is off to a running start with $293,000 in soft money from Citigroup, its executives and subsidiaries. 
   That is more than $1 million from Citigroup, it's executives and subsidiaries in just two and a half years. 
   The powerful banking interest BankAmerica, its executives and subsidiaries also weighed in with more than $347,000 in soft money in the 1998 election cycle, and more than $40,000 already in the current election cycle. 
   And let's not forget the insurance industry. They have a massive stake in this legislation as well, an interest that is well-reflected by the size of the industry's soft money contributions. 
   For instance, there is the Chubb Corp and its subsidiaries, which gave nearly $220,000 in soft money contributions in 1997 and 1998, and has given more than $60,000 already in 1999. 
   Then there is the industry lobby group, the American Council of Life Insurance, which also gave heavily to the parties with more than $315,000 in soft money contributions in 1997 and 1998, and more than $63,000 so far this year. 
   In the end, what do all these contributions add up to? They add up to tremendous access to legislators and broad influence over the process by which this legislation was crafted--access and influence that the average consumer can't even begin to imagine, let alone afford. 
   This is a serious problem, and I think everyone in this Chamber knows it. 
   The American people certainly know it. 
   They think our votes are on the auction block, and who can blame them. 
   Who can blame them, and more than that, who can show them why they should think otherwise? 
   That is a question I ask my colleagues, and I think we all know the answer.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the amendment of the Senator from California to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. First, let me thank Senator FEINSTEIN for her leadership on this critical issue. This very provision is incorporated in my own HOPE for Africa bill, S. 1636, and I am especially pleased she is offering that language as an amendment to this bill today. 
   AGOA's aim is to strengthen economic ties between the United States and the diverse states of sub-Saharan Africa, fostering economic development and mutually beneficial growth. I think that we can all agree that this is a worthy goal. The disagreement is about how we get from here to there. 
   It is my belief that no U.S.-Africa trade bill will succeed unless it addresses the underlying context for growth and development in Africa. The United States needs to pass legislation that will help set the stage for a real economic partnership. 
   The Feinstein-Feingold amendment is a good start because it is impossible to address Africa's economic and social development problems without taking serious action to combat the region's HIV/AIDs epidemic. 
   In 1998, four out of every five HIV/AIDs-related deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, HIV/AIDS kills over 5,000 Africans each day. 
   Common decency tells us that this is a humanitarian catastrophe. Basic logic also tells us that it is economically devastating. 
   AIDS attacks the most productive segment of society--the young adults who would otherwise be the engine in Africa's economy. And it leaves far too many children orphaned, preparing to take their place in society without the guidance and security that their parents would have provided. 
   And the health-care costs associated with AIDS are astronomical. Life-savings medications can cost $12,000 per year--an impossible burden in countries where average per-capita annual income often barely exceed $1,000. 
   How can the United States expect to find a strong economic partner in Africa if it ignores these facts? 
   This amendment does not hide from these realities. It approaches them head-on, by prohibiting U.S. funds from being used to change the intellectual property laws of African states. 
   That means that taxpayer dollars will not be spent to help pharmaceutical companies undermine the legal efforts of some African states to gain and retain access to lower cost pharmaceuticals. 
   It is important to be clear--this amendment does not allow African states to ``get away with something.'' It explicitly refers to the legal means by which these countries are entitled to address their public health emergencies. 
   These legal methods, which are permitted under the agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, or TRIPS, lower prices for consumers by creating competition in the  market for patented goods through a procedure called compulsory licensing. TRIPS is an agreement administered by the World Trade Organization. 
   Compulsory licensing does not ignore the rights of patent-holders. Pharmaceutical companies holding patents on HIV/AIDS drugs are paid a royalty under these arrangements. 
   This amendment simply prohibits the United States from spending money to undermine an entirely legal fight for survival that is being waged in Africa today. 
   It is legal. It is the right thing to do. And ultimately, it is in America's interest, as healthier African people will undoubtedly lead to healthier African economies.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to very much thank the chairman and manager of the bill for accepting amendment No. 2408, which I offered and was cosponsored by Senator DURBIN of Illinois, with regard to anticorruption efforts and the desire to do something about the fact that bribery is an important problem worldwide. It poisons the business environment and distorts the normal practices of the marketplace. Bribery undermines democracy and leads to a lower global economy, and when corruption goes unchecked, everybody loses. 
   To pass the U.S. trade package without addressing corruption simply doesn't make sense, particularly if the package claims to actually promote growth and opportunity in Africa. Of the 16 sub-Saharan African states rated in the Transparency International 1999 Corruption Perception Index, 12 ranked in the bottom half. 
   The amendment Senator DURBIN and I have offered expresses a sense of Congress that the United States should encourage the accession of sub-Saharan African companies to the OECD Convention combating bribery of foreign officials in international business transactions. The OECD Convention criminalizes bribery of foreign officials to influence or retain business. Some have had said OECD standards are too demanding for the developing economies of Africa. But if we are going to engage in a new economic partnership with Africa, I think we need to leave this double standard behind. Transparency, integrity, and the rule of law are as important in Mali and Botswana as they are right here at home. 
   Ever since Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, under the leadership of one of my predecessors, Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin, we have shared a consensus in this country that economic relations depend upon a foundation of fair play. This amendment incorporates that reality in African trade regulations. This anticorruption amendment also sends an important signal. It tells sub-Saharan states that responsibilities come with benefits in any trade partnership. If this Congress is serious about engaging Africa economically, we have to make these responsibilities crystal clear. 
   I, again, thank the Chair for accepting this amendment. I also commend Senator DURBIN, who has taken the lead--and I joined him--on another amendment having to do with this corruption issue. I am hopeful and optimistic that item will be accepted as well. 
   We have provided two different important provisions that will move forward with regard to the corruption problem in general and specifically with regard to the African nations.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with regard to amendment No. 2409, 
   I urge Members to look at the Statement of Policy in the text of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. In this section the bill asserts congressional support for a series of noble causes, such as supporting the development of civil societies and political freedom in the region, and focusing on countries committed to accountable government and the eradication of poverty. 
   But then those causes seem to disappear. The implication is that the United States plans to support for these worthy goals--goals that are in our own self-interest--through a series of limited trade benefits. 
   Nowhere does AGOA mention the role that development assistance plays in pursuing the very ends that it advocates--the eradication of poverty and the development of civil society. 
   This omission sends an alarming signal. It suggests that the United States may delude itself into thinking that trade alone will stimulate African development. 
   Trade alone cannot address the crippling effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has lowered life expectancies by as much as seventeen years in some African countries. Striking at the most productive segment of society--young adults--HIV/AIDS has dealt a brutal blow to African economic development, and has left a generation of orphans in its wake. 
   And trade alone will not provide sufficient access to education or to reproductive health services for African women--yet both elements are crucial to developing Africa's human resources. 
   This amendment expresses a sense of Congress that the HIV/AIDS epidemic and chronic food insecurity should be key priorities in U.S. assistance to Africa. It also prioritizes voluntary family planning services, including access to prenatal healthcare; education and vocational training, particularly for women; and programs designed to develop income-generating opportunities, such as micro-credit projects. 
   This amendment also mandates that the Development Fund for Africa be re-established for aid authorized specifically for African-related objectives. The DFA allows USAID more flexibility in its Africa program. Perhaps most importantly, it is symbolic of U.S. commitment to African development. 
   In addition, my amendment requires USAID to submit a report to help the United States to get smarter about how it administers development assistance, and will ensure that our assistance fosters dynamic civil societies across the diverse nations of Africa. 
   This amendment sends an important signal. Even as the United States considers closer trade relations with sub-Saharan Africa, this country will not abandon its commitment to responsible and well-monitored development assistance. 
   Mr. President, I understand that a point of order is likely to be raised to this amendment. I understand the consequence of that. But I want to offer the amendment. I call up amendment No. 2409.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the two floor leaders--the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee--for allowing me to make this modification to my amendment. 
   I understand they will be opposing it, but I very much appreciate their willingness to allow me to offer it in the form I want. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act is all about increasing our level of trade with sub-Saharan Africa. That's a worthy goal, because the current level of trade between the American and the African people is depressingly small. Africa represents only 1 percent of U.S. imports, 1 percent of U.S. exports, and 1 percent of U.S. foreign direct investment. AGOA's supporters want to see those numbers increase, and that is what I want as well. However, the principal trade benefit appearing in AGOA is temporary preferential access to the U.S. market for textiles and apparel. This kind of legislation discourages the economic diversification that Africa needs to build economic strength. 
   AGOA does renew the GSP program, but does not amend it to provide duty-free benefits for many of Africa's primary exports. This amendment, if accepted, will make the African Growth and Opportunity Act much more meaningful in terms of potential trade, while at the same time ensuring that this legislation does no harm. It expands the list of African products eligible for duty-free access to U.S. markets, while at the same time adding important qualifications to ensure that growth does not come at the expense of human development. 
   My amendment would make goods listed under the Lome Convention eligible for duty-free access, provided those goods are not determined to be import-sensitive by the President of the United States. Products covered include all of sub-Saharan Africa's industrial products, all primary mineral products, and most of Africa's agricultural products, such as fruits, nuts, cereals, cocoa, and basketware. These provisions mean more trade opportunities for more African people. 
   That's an important idea--opportunities for African people. In fact, unlike the African Growth and Opportunity Act as it stands now, this amendment would ensure that Africans themselves are employed at the firms receiving benefits. My amendment requires that any textile firm receiving trade benefits must employ a workforce that is 90 percent African. In addition, my amendment requires that 60 percent of the value-added to a product comes from Africa. These provisions hold out an incentive to African governments, businesses, and civil societies to develop their human resources. And that would not only be good for Africa, but it would be good for America as well, as our trade partners in the region gain economic strength. At the same time that this amendment does more for Africans, it also takes important steps to protect American jobs from being lost to transshipment. 
   Trans-shipment occurs when textiles originating in one country are sent through another before they come to the United States. In this way, the actual country of origin can ignore U.S. quotas. Approximately $2 billion worth of illegally transshipped textiles enter the United States every year. The U.S. Customs Service has determined that for every $1 billion of illegally transshipped products that enter the United  States, 40,000 jobs in the textile and apparel sector are lost. 
   Those who think that transshipment isn't going to be a problem in Africa had better think again. An official website of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation quoted an analyst as saying that:  
   Setting up assembly plants with Chinese equipment, technology and personnel could not only greatly increase sales in African countries, but also circumvent the quotas imposed in commodities of Chinese origin imposed by European and American countries.  
   The Chinese know that standard United States protections against transshipment are weak and easy to defeat. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act, as it currently stands, relies on the same old weak protections that have led to these statistics--the same textile visa system that China and the other countries have manipulated in the past. This inadequate system requires government officials in the country of manufacturing to give textiles visas before those textiles can be exported, in order to certify the goods' country of origin. But often, corrupt officials simply sell visas to the highest bidder. 
   My amendment would create a new system--one that makes the U.S. importer responsible for certifying where textiles and apparel were produced. This gives U.S. entities a strong financial stake in the legality of their imports. Instead of relying on foreign officials, this standard relies on the American companies who operate right here, under American law. This amendment also requires foreign governments to cooperate with Customs Service investigations into transshipment, or risk losing their trade benefits. 
   If we pass this amendment, countries that want to skirt U.S. trade regulations will have to re-think their designs on Africa. As the Senate moves to increase the levels of legal trade between the United States and Africa, we must think carefully about the context in which we conduct our trade relations. Labor rights, human rights, and environmental protections are given short shrift by the current version of the African Growth and Opportunity Act. This is a recipe for social unrest and distorted development, and it is clearly in the United States' best interest to address these issues. 
   We are all affected when logging and mining deplete African rainforests and increase global warming. We are all degraded when the products we buy and use are created by exploitation and abuse. And we all reap the benefits of an Africa where freedom and human dignity reign, creating a stable environment in which business can thrive. American ideals and simple good sense require that we be vigilant in this regard. This amendment contains provisions to address labor rights, human rights, and environmental protection. Mr. President, Africa labor unions have been opposing AGOA for good reasons. This amendment takes their concerns seriously. It clearly spells out the labor rights that our trade partners in Africa must enforce in order to receive benefits. These include the right of association, the right to organize and bargain collectively, a prohibition on forced labor, minimum age of 15, and provisions for acceptable conditions with respect to wages, hours, and safety. 
   This amendment also provides for a monitoring procedure that involves the Africa Region branch of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in compliance reporting. These provisions go far beyond the labor protections in the current bill, which are linked to GSP--and they do so for a reason. GSP labor rights provisions are rarely enforced. Some African countries--such as Equatorial Guinea--receive GSP currently yet do not allow the establishment of independent free trade unions. Clearly, GSP is not enough to ensure the growth and opportunity are not exchanged for abuse and exploitation. 
   This amendment would also deny benefits to countries engaging in significant human rights abuses. Mr. President, that is stronger language than AGOA currently contains, and it sends a clear signal about the kinds of partners the United States is seeking in Africa. As it stands, AGOA contains no environmental provisions whatsoever. Yet in some African countries like Tanzania, 85 percent of the population lives directly off the land. Clearly, development in Africa is contingent on environmental sustainability. My amendment grants additional trade benefits to U.S. and other foreign investors from developed countries when they use the same environmental technology and practices in Africa that they use at home. This amendment makes AGOA more important and more responsible. If we are serious about engaging in Africa, let's make a genuine effort, rather than a token one. Let's make a responsible effort rather than an indifferent one. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I hope Senators are not confused by the comments of the Senator from New York. Certainly, the 90-percent requirement with regard to workers in Africa is one of many provisions in this. This is not the same amendment as yesterday. This involves labor protections, human rights protections, environmental protections, expanding the list of goods. This is a much broader alternative. In fact, it is essentially the HOPE alternative. So I hope the Senators vote for this. Although we received 44 votes on the transshipment amendment, this is by no means a vote on this particular provision. I want to be clear about that.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as I have said before, unless the African Growth and Opportunity Act is significantly improved, it will fail to stimulate any meaningful growth in Africa; it will fail to provide significant opportunities for commerce or development; and, in fact, if we do not make some changes, it may do harm to both Africans and Americans. So what this amendment does is take an important step toward preventing harm and improving this trade legislation. 
   Mutually beneficial economic legislation has to be fair to all parties involved. The African Growth and Opportunity Act must be amended to adequately address the problems of transshipment, not just to make certain that it is fair to Africans but also to ensure Americans are not cheated and that American law isn't broken. 
   Let me talk a little bit about transshipment. Transshipment occurs when textiles originating in one country are sent through another before they come to the United States. What this does is, the actual country of origin seeks to disguise itself and therefore ignore our U.S. quotas. This is not a minor matter. Approximately $2 billion worth of illegally transshipped textiles enter the United States every year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a little confusing. We are debating several amendments at once. I would like to see if we could get a little back and forth going. I wanted to respond to the chairman's comments about my amendment, but then he went into several arguments about the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. I am worried it is going to be awfully hard for people to follow this. 
   Let me return to and respond to the concerns of the chairman with regard to the amendment I have offered, to try to do something about this problem of transshipment, this problem that some countries--very likely China--will take advantage of this new Africa Growth and Opportunity Act to ship a lot more of their goods through Africa into the United States, and not only harm the African nations and people who are trying to benefit from this but harm American jobs. 
   Every $1 billion of transshipped goods into this country apparently costs about 40,000 American jobs in the textile-related area. 
   When the chairman suggests we are trying to discourage legal trade by this amendment, that is the opposite of what we are doing. We are trying to prevent this kind of circumvention of  the spirit and intent of the law by unfair and what should be illegal transshipment. 
   The Senator has suggested somehow there is a constitutional problem with imposing some penalties on importers who are given some responsibilities in this regard. I was not clear on what the constitutional provision was. I assume it is the notion of taking property without due process of law. But if we take a look at these penalties, what we are trying to do is make absolutely sure the importer cooperates with the Customs Service in order to make sure what is happening is not a scam by a government, such as the Chinese Government, to transship its goods through Africa. 
   Let's look at the actual language the Senator has complained about. He refers to the use of ``best available information.'' All that is required for an importer is that an importer has to cooperate. Let me emphasize this for my colleagues. It says:  
   If an importer or retailer fails to cooperate with the Customs Service in an investigation to determine if there was a violation of any provision of this section, the Customs Service shall base its determination on the best available information.  
   The only time this ``best available information'' is even utilized is where the importer has not been willing to cooperate. I think that is entirely reasonable. The Senator refers to these penalties as draconian, as too severe. Let's remember what this bill does. It gives these importers a golden opportunity, a new opportunity to make a lot of money through these new trade opportunities with Africa. I do not think it is draconian to ask these importers to take reasonable steps to avoid the kind of abuse China obviously intends to pursue in this area. 
   The penalty for the first offense is a civil penalty in the amount equal to 200 percent of declared value of merchandise, plus forfeiture of merchandise. In light of the new opportunities this gives these importers, I do not see this as draconian. I see this as a penalty that is commensurate with the kind of opportunities they are provided. I assume these importers in good faith do not want to facilitate Chinese 
   circumvention of our laws and our quotas. I assume their goal is a good-faith desire to make a profit by trading with these African countries. So we need to do something other than what is the current law, and all the bill does in its current form is reiterate the current law that does not work because it relies on foreign officials to certify these products are really African goods. 
   That is not good enough. We need to place some responsibility on the importer who is subject to American law. This is the critical point. Either we are going to simply pass this bill, which, frankly, already is very unbalanced and not sufficient to protect American workers, or we are going to try to fix it. Surely, one area we need to fix is this transshipment problem. 
   Let me quote, again, these web sites of the People's Republic of China, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. They say, about the current law which this bill continues:  
   There are many opportunities for Chinese business people in Africa. Setting up assembly plants with Chinese equipment and personnel could not only greatly increase sales in African countries, but also circumvent the quotas imposed on commodities of Chinese origin imposed by European and American countries.  
   The opposition to this amendment simply wants to allow the Chinese Government to continue this program. They provide no tough penalties, no obligation for people we can do something about, such as importers and people under American law. They want to let the good times roll for these Chinese companies and governments that are trying to undercut American jobs. 
   I think that is wrong. Clearly, if there is anything should be adopted, it should be some cracking down on the extremely abusive practice of transshipping. Let's not let these African countries be pawns for the Chinese goal of undercutting American jobs. 
   Our amendment will strengthen this bill. It certainly will not weaken the bill. It will make the bill a much more honest attempt to make sure this fosters a trade relationship between the United States and the countries of Africa--not a conduit for Chinese abuse of American quotas. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the African Growth and Opportunity Act, we have to keep asking ourselves the key question: Growth and opportunity for whom? 
   It is an important question because the Africa trade legislation we are now considering does not require that Africans themselves be employed at the firms that are going to receive the trade benefits. In fact, AGOA, as it now stands, actually takes a step backwards for Africa. The GSP program requires that 35 percent of a product's value added come from Africa, but this legislation actually lowers the bar to 20 percent. 
   Under this scheme, it is possible that a product would meet the 20-percent requirement and qualify for AGOA benefits. For example, if non-African workers physically standing in West Africa simply sewed a ``Made in Togo'' label on apparel and then shipped it to the United States, that is all they would have to do. It makes something of a mockery of how this is supposed to help African countries and African workers. 
   This plan undercuts the potential for trade to boost African employment and encourages transshipment of goods from third countries seeking to evade quotas. As I said before on the other amendment, the U.S. Customs Service has determined that for every $1 billion of illegally transshipped products that enter the United States, 40,000 jobs in the textile and apparel sector are lost. 
   So this amendment would also fight transshipment but in another way, requiring that 60 percent of the value added to a product has to come from Africa. It is a significant improvement over the 20 percent of the bill. I think it is an appropriate improvement over the 35 percent of the GSP standard. 
   This amendment also emphasizes African opportunities. It requires that any textile firm receiving trade benefits must employ a workforce that is 90-percent African. This doesn't mean that all 90 percent of the people have to come from a particular African country where the company might be or the activity might be, but they do have to be citizens of an African country. 
   This provision holds out an incentive to African governments, businesses, and civil society to develop their human resources. That would not only be good for Africa; it would be good for America, as well as our trading partners in the region gaining economic strength. 
   Without these amendments, this legislation offers neither growth nor opportunity to Africans themselves. In fact, unless the Senate makes these changes, we will simply see a continuation of a disturbing trend. 
   In the first 4 years of this decade, corporate profits in Africa average 24 to 30 percent compared with 16 to 18 percent for all developing countries. But real wages in Africa continue to fall, as they have for nearly three decades now. The number of African families unable to meet their basic needs has doubled. It would be irresponsible to pass an African trade bill that reinforced this dangerous disconnect between corporate profits and African wages. 
   I know my colleagues who support the African Growth and Opportunity Act do so because they genuinely want to engage with the continent. I share their goal, and I believe this amendment would push U.S. Africa policy in that direction by linking economic growth and human development protecting both African and American interests. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in response to the chairman's remarks, I believe those provisions would be enforceable. We already have a mechanism where an import's country of origin must be verified. The consent must also be verified. I suggest we use the same mechanisms in place to certify African value content. In fact, it was indicated under GSP that it is a 35-percent requirement and under this bill is a 20-percent requirement. 
   The question doesn't seem to be whether we can enforce it or identify it; the question seems to be, What should the percentage be? 
   In response to the broader point that somehow this is going to be unfair to the countries of Africa, it is just the opposite. What we are trying to avoid  with this amendment is, in effect, the exploitation of African countries as a way for other countries to get away with something they can do right now very easily; for example, the Chinese willingness here to use transshipment through African companies to undercut American jobs. All we are trying to do is have a reasonable assurance, in two ways, that Africans are actually having a chance to do the work and they are actually contributing to the product. 
   A 60-percent requirement is not 100 percent, it is a reasonable level. It still leaves room for joint activities with other entities. And a 90-percent requirement is not restricted, as the chairman has suggested, to one country, but 90 percent have to be African citizens of any one of the over 50 African countries. It still leaves a 10-percent possibility for workers from other countries. If we don't do this, this 
   proposal has nothing to do with making sure African workers get an opportunity to have a decent living and to have these economic opportunities. This bill has to be a two-way street at some level, Mr. President; it is not that now. This amendment is a good-faith effort to make it more balanced and to be fairer to African workers. I strongly suggest it is a modest step that needs to be taken to improve this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I wish to ask a question. Our bill only provides that 90 percent of the people who work in the firm have to be citizens of an African country. It does not suggest in any way anything about their ethnic or racial background. I am very sensitive to that. I wonder if the Senator is aware that that is the only requirement, so anyone who is a citizen of any one of the African countries, regardless of their background, would be within the 90 percent.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in response to that, I recognize the argument regarding American history. Surely there is a different scenario when we talk about African countries. 
   The problem I am trying to address--and I appreciate the Senator's point--is that we are fearful, with good reason, that African countries will be used as a conduit to allow the kind of activity the Chinese entities obviously intend to pursue, which is to essentially run these products through an African country, stamp the label on it, not really let Africans play a significant role in producing the product, and undercut our quota laws. That is the reason for doing this. I don't think it is particularly difficult to administer or to do when we suggest we are talking here about citizenship of an African country without any other criteria. 
   We do allow for migration in Africa. We allow for Africa seeking out opportunities where they find them. We are trying to make sure this is some nexus between this legislation and the opportunities for Africans to benefit, as well as large corporations that may benefit. This is an attempt to make the bill better. I think it is one that is not too difficult to achieve. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment simply intends to try to make sure that the African portion of this legislation does not become a mechanism whereby governments or businesses from China, for example, ship their goods through Africa as a way to evade American quotas. 
   This is another process called transshipment. During the debate, I pointed out that on a web site of the Chinese Government, they essentially say this is exactly what they are going to do. It is what they are already doing. 
   We have put some responsibility on importers. American importers will have the benefit of this bill to make sure they vouch for the legitimate content of this product having some characteristic of being actually from Africa. It is a very important provision to make sure this bill has some balance and it doesn't threaten American jobs. The figures I quoted indicate that for every $1 billion in illegally transshipped goods, it costs about 40,000 American jobs in the textile and related areas. 
   This is a very straightforward amendment that opposes the practice of transshipment I think every Member of this body would like to support.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to respond to both the chairman and the ranking member. 
   They have suggested, it seems to me, that somehow this provision automatically involves imprisonment. That is simply not correct. Under the first offense, there is only a civil penalty involved for the importer in the amount equal to 200 percent of the declared value of the merchandise. A second offense then would involve perhaps up to 1 year of imprisonment. It is only in a third offense that it would be 5 years. 
   It is simply not correct to suggest that if somebody makes a mistake once, suddenly they are going to be imprisoned. It is not nearly as harsh as that. It is a reasonable series of penalties for people who are going to get enormous benefit under this legislation.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the publication of Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac. The publication of this work has been celebrated in my home state throughout 1999, most recently with a major national conference on the future of the land ethic at the beginning of this month. However, October 27, 1949 is the date that Oxford Press released the first edition of the book. 
   Aldo Leopold is considered to be the father of wildlife ecology. He was a renowned scientist and scholar, exceptional teacher, philosopher, and gifted writer. It is for this book, A Sand County Almanac, that Leopold is best known by millions of people around the globe. The book has been acclaimed as the century's literary landmark in conservation. It led to a philosophy that has guided many to discovering what it means to live in harmony with the land. 
   When Leopold died in 1948, he had yet to see his Sand County Almanac in print, and it was through the efforts of his son Luna that the first version of A Sand County Almanac was made available to the public. 
   Aldo Leopold's authority as a philosopher of conservation came from a lifelong love of wilderness and the recognition of his need to be surrounded by ``things natural, wild, and free.'' Upon graduation from Yale University, Leopold went to work for the United States Forest Service in 1909, helped to found the Wilderness Society, and in 1924 was responsible for the institution, through administrative action, of the first of the United States' Wilderness Areas, the Gila National Forest in New Mexico. From 1933 until his death, Leopold held a chair in game management at the University of Wisconsin. 
   Although Leopold's love of the land is apparent in the book, his book does not cry out in defense of particular tracts of land about to go under the axe or plow. Rather Leopold deals with the minutiae of often unnoticed plants and animals, all the little things that one might overlook in the task of managing lands but which must be present to add up to healthy ecosystems. 
   Part I of A Sand County Almanac is devoted to the details of a single piece of land: Leopold's 120-acre property in central Wisconsin, abandoned as a working farm years before because of the prevalence of sandy soil from which the ``Sand Counties'' took their nickname. It was at this weekend retreat, Leopold says, ``that we try to rebuild, with shovel and axe, what we are losing elsewhere.'' 
   Month by month, Leopold leads the reader through the progression of the seasons with descriptions of such things as skunk tracks, the songs, habits, and attitudes of dozens of bird species, cycles of high water in the river, the timely appearance and blooming of several plants, and the joys of cutting one's own firewood. Part of Leopold's request, toward the end of the book, that we attach values to the things in nature that have no apparent economic worth. At the time Leopold's Wisconsin sand farm itself was economically valueless because of its unsuitability for crops, timber or pasture. However, from Leopold's essays one comes to realize that here is a parcel of land that is anything but worthless; the property that yields to its owner the multitude of joys and insights that Leopold describes is a rich piece of ground indeed. 
   In Part II of A Sand County Almanac, titled ``The Quality of Landscape,'' Leopold takes his reader away from the farm; first into the surrounding Wisconsin countryside and then even farther. Leopold describes an Illinois bus ride, a visit to the Iowa of his boyhood, on to Arizona and New Mexico where he first worked with the U.S. Forest Service, across the southern border into Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexico, north to Oregon and Utah, and finally travel across the northern border into Manitoba, Canada. 
   In each of these places, Leopold outlines the natural history of the region. Leopold understood the difficulty of the choices before us, and certainly knew the paradox with which we are faced: ``But all conservation of wildness is self-defeating,'' he writes, ``for to cherish we must see and fondle, and when we have seen and fondled, there is no wilderness left to cherish.'' 
   In the final pages of A Sand County Almanac, Leopold introduces the concept of a ``land ethic'' and a plea that such an ethic be adopted. Leopold defines philosophical ethics as ``the differentiation of social from anti-social conduct'' for the common good of the community, and declares that a land ethic, wherein the ecologies in which we erect our developments would be considered an integral part of the community, amounts to the same thing as social ethics. A land ethic, in the author's terms, means a ``willing limitation on freedom of action in the struggle for survival.''

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to briefly comment on a significant development in the fight for campaign finance reform. This morning, a bipartisan group of Senators, led by the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. HAGEL, announced a new campaign finance reform proposal. Let me say that I and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, warmly welcome the heightened participation of this new group of Senators, which includes the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. LANDRIEU, who has been, from the day she came to the Senate, a strong supporter of campaign finance reform. I also note that it includes five Republican Senators who have previously never voted for a campaign finance reform measure that includes limits on soft money. 
   As I predicted last week on the floor, the wall of protection for the current system of unlimited soft money contributions to the political parties is rapidly crumbling. While I am pleased by this development, I am not surprised. The soft money system is indefensible. I think we saw that during our abbreviated debate last week. Opponents of reform didn't defend soft money; they tried to divert our attention from it. They actually questioned whether there is anything corrupting about unlimited contributions from corporate and union treasuries to the political parties. 
   As the chairman of the Global Board of Directors of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu wrote in the New York Times when he heard about these comments on the floor:  
   You could almost here the laughter coming from boardrooms and executive suites all over the country when Senate opponents of campaign finance reform expressed dismay that anyone could think big political contributions are corrupting elections and government.  
   I think the new initiative, led by the Senator from Nebraska, recognizes the opponents of reform have now retreated to an untenable position. They are defending the indefensible. To say there is nothing wrong with unlimited contributions to the political parties, that this is somehow the ``American way,'' is to live in a fantasy world the American people simply will not accept. 
   The public knows soft money is wrong. The public knows soft money is corrupting. And the business community knows it, too, as the Global Chairman of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu so well expressed. 
   While the Hagel proposal does not ban soft money completely, which I believe is an essential element of an acceptable campaign finance reform bill, it does limit it significantly. So what you have here is a whole new group of Republican Senators, as well as some Democrats who are obviously saying it is not unconstitutional to limit soft money. In fact, they are obviously seeing the abuse of $300,000 or $500,000 contributions and they want to do something about it. So I am looking forward to working with Senator HAGEL and the others to reach common ground. 
   When campaign finance reform left the floor last week, we had a total of 55 Senators who had voted in favor of reform. Now, with this new initiative, there are five more Senators who apparently are prepared to vote to change this system. I think that is very significant, as I am sure my colleagues know, because what is 55 plus 5? It is 60. If we can bring all of these Senators together on a package they can all accept, we can break the filibuster. What we need now is real hard work, bipartisan work. We need to bridge our differences. If we can do that, we can defeat the defenders of this corrupt system and give the people a cleaner and fairer campaign finance system for the new century. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I've already stated my opposition to this Africa trade bill. At best, it does virtually nothing for Africa, and at worst it actually harms African economies while doing little for the United States. 
   Instead, the Senate should support legislation that works with the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa to diversify and strengthen African economies and fight the real enemies of economic progress on the continent: the overwhelming debt burden and the devastating AIDS epidemic. 
   There are many sound policy reasons for opposing this bill, which carries the slightly Orwellian title, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act or AGOA. These reasons have been well articulated during this debate. 
   But today I come to the floor to talk about who supports AGOA--a long list of wealthy corporations who will reap huge benefits if AGOA becomes law. 
   I don't think my colleagues will be surprised to learn that many of these corporate interests are also powerful political donors who know how to use the current campaign finance system to lobby Congress when their interests are at stake. 
   Many supporters of AGOA can be found among the members of Africa Growth and Opportunity Act Coalition, Inc. I'm not making this up Mr. President. This corporation was established, according to its website, to ``demonstrate to the United States Senate that there is significant public support behind enacting the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (H.R. 434).'' 
   I argue that the support this coalition really demonstrates is not broad-based support from the American public, but the very narrow support of the few but powerful members of the coalition themselves--Amoco, Chevron, Mobil, The Gap, Limited Inc., Enron, General Electric, SBC Communications, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Caterpillar and Motorola, to name just a few. 
   Our campaign finance system allows these companies to be heard on the issue of Africa trade not only because of their business concerns, but because of the legal loophole they have at their disposal to influence this policy debate--unregulated, unlimited soft money contributions. 
   This coalition has the weight of millions of dollars of soft money behind it, Mr. President. 
   We know these corporations have the wealth and clout to be heard in Congress on this bill, so the only question is--what does AGOA offer them? 
   AGOA provides millions in benefits to help corporations invest in Africa--corporations that are often already investing there in the first place, and many corporations that, not coincidentally, comprise the AGOA coalition. 
   AGOA is a huge windfall for many American corporations, but it does little or nothing for African nations or African people or working Americans. 
   It doesn't make an effort to stimulate African economies by helping small businesses in Africa, or adequately guard against transhipment of goods through Africa, which will rob Africans of the benefits AGOA is supposed to intend. 
   Essentially it offers the status quo, plus a multi-million dollar bonus in tariff reductions for American corporations that already do business on the continent. 
   Mr. President, just to give an idea of the soft money donations that give the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act Coalition, Inc., so much clout, I'd like to Call the Bankroll on this industry coalition, as I do from time to time on this floor, for the benefit of the public and my colleagues. 
   First the total numbers. The companies that are members of this coalition gave a total of $5,108,735 in soft money to the political parties in the `98 election cycle. Over $5 million in one cycle, Mr. President. That is an extraordinary figure. Our parties have received over $5 million in financial support from this industry coalition that was organized to lobby for this bill. Are we really comfortable with that? Does that not give us just a little pause? 
   Two major U.S. retailers and coalition members, Gap Inc. and The Limited Inc., have a particularly strong interest in passing AGOA, since they can benefit from importing cheap textiles. Let's look at their soft money contributions specifically. 
   During the 1997-1998 election cycle, Limited, Inc. gave the political parties $553,000 in soft money donations, and in just the first six months of 1999, Limited Inc. gave the parties more than $160,000 via the soft money loophole. 
   The Gap also played the soft money game during this period, with more than $185,000 in the 1998 election cycle and nearly $54,000 already during the current election cycle. 
   And that's not all, Mr. President, not by a long shot. 
   I'd also like to turn my colleagues attention to the wealthy donors who would like to secure enactment of the Caribbean Basin Initiative or ``CBI'', which was combined with the AGOA in the managers' amendment. 
   The soft money donations from one donor with a huge stake in seeing CBI passed are particularly interesting, and bear mention during this debate. 
   Fruit of the Loom stands to gain $25 to $50 million from so-called CBI-NAFTA parity, which essentially removes tariffs on the goods Fruit of the Loom imports from its places of production in the Caribbean basin. 
   Fruit of the Loom stands to gain at least $25 million, Mr. President, and the loss from eliminating duties on apparel from the Caribbean will run U.S. taxpayers at least $1 billion in lost revenue over five years, according to an article from this week's Time Magazine.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me quote from President Bush's letter, sent on the occasion of CED's 50th anniversary in 1992. He said: ``From its inception in 1942 through the recent end of the Cold War, the CED and its trustees have made significant contributions toward the social and economic development of the United States around the globe.'' 
   So, far from being little known and obscure, CED has been a leading voice of the business community in its interaction with government for over 50 years. It is a nonpartisan group that has had a significant role in government policy in education, job training  and employment, international economics, and budget and fiscal issues. CED Trustees have held numerous high level government posts, and come from both political parties. The current Chairman of CED, Frank Doyle, is the retired Executive Vice President of General Electric, who has served as a U.S. Representative to the OECD and the European Community. 
   It's also fascinating, Mr. President, that the Senator from Kentucky implied during our campaign finance debate that CED's endorsement of campaign finance reform was insignificant because he has gone to great lengths to try to dissuade it from its view. 
   Indeed, this summer, the Senator from Kentucky wrote to up to 20 business executives to urge them to resign from CED because of its position on campaign finance reform. The Senator from Kentucky charged that CED's position was part of a campaign to ``eviscerate private sector participation in politics,'' and ``ban corporate political activism.'' He criticized CED for aligning itself with groups like the Sierra Club on this issue. 
   The chairs of the subcommittee that developed the CED report, which by the way was adopted without dissent either from the subcommittee or from the 56 member Research and Policy Committee that gave it CED's official imprimatur, replied to the Senator from Kentucky that they thought it ``entirely appropriate for groups with diverse interests to speak out jointly on an issue that they believe threatens the vitality of our participatory democracy.'' And they flatly rejected the charge that they want to silence the private sector.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, far from having its intended effect, the Senator from Kentucky's letter, which many believe smacks of intimidation, seems to have emboldened CED and its membership. At last count, 212 business and civic leaders have endorsed the CED report, and not a single member of CED has resigned in response to the Senator from Kentucky's tactics. Not a single one. 
   It was amazing to me, Mr. President, that we heard Senators on the floor during the campaign finance debate questioning whether our current system is corrupting. But the Senate has heard me talk about the corruption of the system a lot. It's no surprise that I think this system has a corrupting influence on the Congress. But for those who are skeptical of this view, perhaps the words of the CED trustee who chaired the subcommittee that developed CED's recommendations on campaign finance, will carry more weight. Listen to the words of Mr. Edward Kangas, who is the Chairman of Global Board of Directors of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, in an opinion piece in the New York Times that appeared after the first days of our campaign finance debate here in the Senate. 
   ``You could almost hear the laughter coming from board rooms and executive suites all over the country when Senate opponents of campaign-finance reform expressed dismay that anyone  could think big political contributions are corrupting elections and government.'' Mr. Kangas continues: ``For a growing number of executives, there's no question that the unrelenting pressure for five- and six-figure political contributions amounts to influence peddling and a corrupting influence. What has been called legalized bribery looks like extortion to us.''  
   Mr. Kangas doesn't mince words on how the system appears to someone who has been part of it. He says:  
   I know from personal experience and from other executives that it's not easy saying no to appeals for cash from powerful members of Congress or their operatives. Congress can have a major impact on businesses. The solicitors know it, and we know it. The threat may be veiled, but the message is clear: failing to donate could hurt your company. You must weigh whether you meet your responsibility to your shareholders better by investing the money in the company or by sending it to Washington.  
   This is an incredible indictment of the system that a minority of this Senate is preserving through a filibuster. These words from a business leader plainly and powerfully answer the arguments from the Senator from Kentucky and others that there is nothing corrupt or corrupting about soft money. This is not some liberal ``do-gooder'' speaking here. This is a respected business person, chairman of the Board of Directors of an international accounting firm, a participant in this system. 
   He says, ``The threat may be veiled but the message is clear. Failing to donate could hurt your company.''

The Campaign for America is an organization founded by Jerome Kohlberg, former founding partner of the firm of Kohlberg, Kravitz. That organization sent us a letter during the recent campaign finance debate, signed by, among others, Warren Buffet, Arjay Miller, who is the former President of Ford Motor Company and Dean Emeritus of Stanford Business School, and Bob Stuart, former Chair of Quaker Oats. These prestigious business leaders write: ``We believe the current soft money system works against the public interest and against the interests of business. .....

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, business support for campaign finance reform is real and it is growing. Businessmen are tired of being the fall guys of American politics. They are tired of seeing politicians with their hands out for money. They are tired of the ever increasing demand for ever larger checks. They are tired of the feeling like they are being shaken-down for their contributions, like political donations are a form of protection money. 
   They are tired of the public's perception that when business wins an argument in Congress it wasn't because its position was right but because they gave big soft money donations to the political parties. That is certainly a risk with this particular Africa trade bill, as my Calling of the Bankroll at the beginning of this presentation showed. 
   I want to commend the leaders of the business community for joining this cause, and standing up to the pressure from those who want to preserve this corrupt system. In the end, they are on the right side of the issue, not only for business, but for the American people. 
   I have to ask my colleagues, Mr. President, how can this body continue to allow soft money contributions to flow to the political parties' warchests--unregulated, unchecked, and doing untold damage to the public perception of the way we do business in this Chamber? 
   How long can we expect the public to put up with a U.S. Senate that refuses to shut down such an egregious loophole, and chooses instead to perpetuate a soft money system that taints everything we do on this floor? 
   That's right. I'll say it again. Everything we do on this floor is called into question by the soft money system. And that includes this Africa and Caribbean trade bill. The $5 million in soft money contributions by the industry coalition created supposedly to show public support for this bill casts a shadow on this debate. It's the 800 pound gorilla, as I've said before, that is sitting over there on the floor and that we all ignore. 
   Until we close the soft money loophole, the shadow will get darker and darker, and the gorilla bigger and bigger. Until we close that loophole, our constituents have every right to be skeptical of whether we work for them, or for the big contributors. Until we close that loophole, the concept of one person, one vote--a basic and fundamental tenet of our democracy--is in serious jeopardy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to this Chamber concerning the tragic news we received yesterday morning that our friend and colleague, John Chafee, passed away on Sunday. 
   John Chafee was a leader who moved the Senate to do great things. He embraced the bipartisanship we are so quick to reject in this Chamber, and he did so with a dignity and integrity that made us proud to serve with him in this body and to call him a colleague and to call him a friend. 
   John constantly worked to bring his colleagues together and to bring his keen intellect and spirit of fairness to bear in an effort to move legislation forward. Whether he was working on health care, the environment, constitutional issues, or Government reform, he approached every issue on its merits and found ways to overcome partisanship to work together. 
   In an atmosphere which asks us to take sides and defend our ground, John Chafee instead sought common ground, and he sought it with an uncommon commitment to what was best for our Nation. And always, as he worked to foster bipartisanship and civility, he held fast to the principles that guided him: a deep commitment to fiscal responsibility and a dedication to protecting our children, preserving our environment, and striving for better health care for every American. 
   I had the honor and pleasure of working with Senator Chafee on a number of issues that affected my State of Wisconsin and the entire Nation. As a distinguished veteran and one of the Senate's greatest patriots, Senator Chafee had the courage and the commitment to constitutional freedom to be a vocal opponent of a constitutional amendment on flag desecration. 
   When he spoke against the amendment before the Judiciary Committee in April, he criticized the measure as the first 
   amendment to the Constitution that would limit, not expand, our freedoms in that great document. But most of all, this great patriot was deeply troubled by state-mandated patriotism. John Chafee said:  
   We cannot mandate respect and pride in the flag. In fact, in my view, taking steps to require citizens to respect the flag sullies its significance and symbolism.  
   With this issue and so many others, it was Senator Chafee's thoughtful and fair-minded approach that commanded my utmost respect and admiration. 
   His work in the area of conservation was legendary. He won huge gains in the fight to protect the environment, including perhaps his greatest achievement, his vital improvements to the Clean Air Act during its reauthorization in 1990. 
   Senator Chafee also was a dedicated advocate for the reauthorization of the Superfund Program and the Endangered Species Act, and though his attempts at reauthorizing these programs were unsuccessful in recent Congresses, in characteristic fashion he managed to carve out significant common ground between the parties on both issues. 
   John's efforts on these issues were a great service to the Nation, as was his support for another issue recently before this body--campaign finance reform. While John and I did not always see eye to eye about each aspect of campaign finance reform, he characteristically found common ground on which we could agree and lent his invaluable credibility to our efforts. 
   I was also fortunate enough to work with Senator Chafee in the area of health care reform where he displayed an unparalleled commitment to improving access and quality of health care for those most in need. His ability to rise above partisanship enabled him to do the real work of the people, working in bipartisan coalitions to address problems in the managed care system and doing the vitally important work of examining health promotion, disease prevention, and improving health care quality. 
   Most recently, I had the pleasure of working with Senator Chafee to draft  legislation to refine portions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that have adversely affected home health care agencies. 
   In everything he did, John Chafee brought a quiet dignity to his work and to the work of this body. We all benefited from the spirit of civility and bipartisanship he fostered during his 23 years in the Senate. I hope we can cherish and nurture that spirit in the years to come. 
   I extend my deepest condolences to John's family, his wife Ginny, his 5 children, and 12 grandchildren. John Chafee was a hero in battle, a distinguished Secretary of the Navy, a great leader as Governor of Rhode Island, and a towering figure in the Senate for more than two decades. His life was an inspiration to all those who believed public service can, indeed, be an honorable profession. All of us who had the opportunity to work with him will cherish his memory and do our best to honor his legacy to the Nation. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask I be yielded such time as I shall consume. 
   I especially thank the Senator from Michigan for his great determination on this issue. I am certainly going to join him on this. 
   I will vote ``no'' on the motion to proceed in a few minutes, but it is not because I oppose moving to the late-term abortion bill at this time. Supporters of campaign finance reform are prepared to move that bill by consent, which keeps the campaign finance bill as the pending business of the Senate--that is all we are trying to do--and thereby allows the Senate to return to it once the late-term abortion bill is completed. 
   This vote we are going to have in a few minutes is not about whether we will debate late-term abortion. Everybody here is prepared to do that. It is about whether we will keep working on the campaign finance bill after a short hiatus to do other business. 
   I want to be clear: Senator MCCAIN and I are ready to move forward in debating our bill. I thought we had an exciting series of votes yesterday, the upshot of which is, we have three new supporters of reform. We need to keep up the pressure for reform. We did not have adequate time on the floor to do that. The majority leader promised on the record 5 days of debate. We had 4 days, and 1 of the days was yesterday when all we did was vote on cloture. 
   I say to my Republican colleagues who say they want the chance to offer amendments, now that we have had those two cloture votes, we can do that. There is every opportunity now to offer amendments. There are a variety of ways to clear places on the amendment tree so the debate can proceed and we can see if we can work something out and actually pass the bill. 
   I appreciate the candor of the Senator from Pennsylvania, who just said, as I understand it, we had a fair debate. This is not what some of the other Republicans said. He also indicated there had been an opportunity to offer amendments. That is what the Senator said. That is the opposite of what many of the opponents of reform said. Which is it? Was there an opportunity to offer amendments or not? Maybe it is an academic debate at this point. It is a very interesting difference in the way the last few days have been characterized. 
   What really counts is that amendments can be offered right now. If there is any Senator out there who is saying he has not had that chance to offer amendments, they should vote to have the Senate continue on the campaign finance reform bill and come down and offer an amendment. Now is not the time to put campaign finance reform back on the calendar, which in this case means the back burner. It is time to come together and work to find a consensus. 
   Whatever different spin is put on this issue, the bottom line is this: The soft money system is wrong and it must be ended. Mr. President, 55 Members of this body have now voted for reform. The time has come to finish the job. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this motion to proceed and help the Senate take a step toward doing that. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be equally divided.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity to state my position on S. 1692, and to explain the reasons why I will again oppose this legislation. 
   I respect the deeply held views of those who oppose abortion in any circumstances. I have always believed that the decisions in this area are best handled by the individuals involved, guided by their own beliefs and unique circumstances, rather than by government mandates. 
   Second, like most Americans, I would prefer to live in a world where abortion is unnecessary. I support efforts to reduce the number of abortions through family planning and counseling to avoid unintended pregnancies. 
   I support Roe v. Wade, but I also understand that some restrictions on abortion can be constitutional when there is a compelling State interest at stake. I have previously voted to ban post-viability abortions unless the woman's life is at risk or the procedure is necessary to protect the woman from grievous injury to her physical health. That is why I will vote for the Durbin alternative to S. 1692. I conduct a Listening Session in every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year. In 1997 and 1998, hundreds of Wisconsin citizens came to talk to me about their serious and sincere concerns that, in some nearby states, abortions are being performed very late in pregnancy for reasons that they believe are not medically indicated. I support legislation that will actually reduce the total number of late-term abortions while providing reasonable exceptions when necessary to deal with serious medical situations. I am disappointed that the proponents of S. 1692 have steadfastly refused to accept any amendment, no matter how tightly crafted, which would include provisions to protect women's physical health. This intentionally polarizing approach is the reason people suspect that the objective of the bill is to further a political issue rather than change the law. 
   I am concerned that S. 1692 will not stop a single abortion late in pregnancy. The bill, by prohibiting only one particular procedure, creates an incentive for an abortion provider to switch to a different procedure that is not banned. The Durbin alternative amendment would stop abortions by any method after a fetus is viable, except when serious medical situations dictate otherwise. 
   I am supporting the Durbin amendment because it recognizes that, in some circumstances, women suffer from severely debilitating diseases specifically caused or exacerbated by a pregnancy or are unable to obtain necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition while carrying a pregnancy to term. The exceptions in the Durbin amendment are limited to conditions for which termination of the pregnancy is medically indicated. It retains the option of abortion for mothers facing extraordinary medical conditions, such as: breast cancer, preeclampsia, uterine rupture, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, for which termination of the pregnancy may be recommended by the woman's physician due to the risk of grievous injury to the mother's physical health or life. In contrast, S. 1692 provides no such exception to protect the mother from grievous injury to her physical health. At the same time, by clearly limiting the medical circumstances where post-viability abortions are permitted, this legislation prohibits these procedures in cases where the mother's health is not at such high risk. 
   I also feel very strongly that Congress should seek to restrict abortions only within the constitutional parameters set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court. I would have preferred that S. 1692 had been reviewed by the Judiciary Committee on which I serve, rather than having been placed straight on the Senate calendar. I believe S. 1692 raises significant constitutional questions, and with court decisions in 19 of the 21 states where state legislation similar to S. 1692 has been challenged, the Judiciary Committee should have reviewed this bill prior to its consideration on the Senate floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in congratulating my dear friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, on his 10,000th vote cast as a member of this body. 
   What a great milestone Senator LEAHY has reached. What a great testament to the commitment of my dear  colleague to his duty as a representative of the people of the state of Vermont. Senator LEAHY now joins an exclusive group of only a handful of Senators who have cast at least 10,000 votes. At a time when many Americans are skeptical of Congress and the political process, it is re-assuring to know that my colleagues, like Senator LEAHY, take their responsibility to their constituents seriously. Even with modern transportation, it is a challenge not to miss this important responsibility of casting votes. 
   Senator LEAHY has been an exemplary Senator. And it's not just the act of voting that matters. I also commend Senator LEAHY for his hard work, dedication, insight and adept ability to work in a bipartisan manner--skills that he has brought to this floor, as well as to his role as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. His leadership has been invaluable to the work of the Committee, as well as the work of moving bills on the Senate floor. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been proud to work with him on innumerable pieces of legislation affecting everything from civil rights to immigration to crime. 
   Mr. President, I once again congratulate my dear colleague, Senator LEAHY, and wish him well in continuing his outstanding work for the American people.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the assistant minority leader for his very kind remarks and his very strong remarks on the need to stay on this bill. I also thank the leader, Senator DASCHLE, for his strong remarks in support of reform in the presence of so many Democratic colleagues on the floor at that time right after the vote was taken. Of course my gratitude goes to the Senator from Arizona for continuing to fight. 
   We are making progress. The story has not yet been told on this floor of what just happened on this vote. Certainly I do not share the interesting account of the Senator from Kentucky, who seems elated that three Republicans who have stuck with him all the way did not vote with him this time. That is what just happened. That is what nobody is pointing out. 
   Day after day after day in this effort I am asked: What other Republicans are you going to get to support you, RUSS? I am never sure because, obviously, each Senator makes his or her own decision. They often do not make their decisions until the last minute because these issues are often tough calls. But we finally had a vote where we found out we have a lot more support than some people thought. This is why games have been played in the last couple of days. This is why we had the Senator from Kentucky voting not to table a soft money ban last night. I don't think he has changed his mind. But he urged every one of his Republican colleagues last night to, in effect, vote to ban soft money after they just stood out here for 2 or 3 days and argued against a ban. 
   Why? Why would they do that? Why did we not meet this morning? Why  didn't the Senate do anything this morning? Here we are, near the end of one of the most difficult floor periods in a Congress, with appropriations bills and many other matters before us, with the leadership telling us over and over again we need to get all this work done, but we did not meet this morning. I will tell you why. Because the Senator from Kentucky knows his support is slipping. He may have even known we would pick up the support--and I say this to members of the press and others who always ask me this: Who is going to support you? This time we had Senators from Delaware and Arkansas and Kansas vote with us, including Senators who have never voted with us before. 
   I recognize there are still some tough issues to resolve for some of the Senators who voted with us. But this is an exciting development. Last year the big deal was we had not gotten a majority. Then we got a majority. The natural question is, How do you get to 60 votes? My answer is, one at a time. But today we took three steps in that direction. I think that tells you what is going on. They want to move off this bill because we are moving in the right direction. We are not there yet but, boy, we are getting closer. 
   What will bring us to the end of this process, a fair end of this process? First of all, the understanding we had is that we would have 5 real days of debate and amendment. You cannot count starting at 7:30 at night on a Wednesday when Senators had left the Capitol as a day. So we are entitled, under this understanding, to come back in here the rest of today and tomorrow and debate this issue. We had three full days on this bill--Thursday, Friday, and Monday. On two of those days we had no real votes. Then today, the fourth day, we didn't come in until 1:15 pm. That is not the five days of debate that we were promised. 
   I know there are other Senators on the Republican side who want to join us, who want to add to the 55. But they want something every Senator has a right to want. They want a chance to offer amendments. They have some ideas they would like to add to this soft money ban that I think could be acceptable, and they could finally help us break down this absurd roadblock to banning this form of corruption that is affecting the Senate. 
   Make no mistake, three new Senators have voted with us. They do not represent an ideological group from the left or the right. They are just different Senators who, I believe, have finally had it with this soft money system. This is why the Senator from Arizona and I used the strategy of simplifying this bill, of saying let's at least have an up-or-down vote on soft money. That is what we just had. I find what these Senators did very encouraging. I thank them because it takes guts. It is tough to stand up to your leadership on this. They did it. I am grateful for this vote. It is very significant. 
   So we should not leave the issue now. This is the time to let those Senators, and other Senators who have indicated an interest in banning soft money, come to the floor, offer their amendments, and see if we can fashion a compromise that could cause the Senate to be proud and to join the House in trying to actually do something about this problem. 
   I thank all the Senators who will assist us in preventing this matter from coming off the floor. It belongs on the floor. It is the most important issue before this country, and we need to continue to work on it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has been waiting a long time. 
   I will yield to him in 1 minute. But I want to make a quick point with regard to speech comments by the Senator from Colorado. 
   He and I had a good discussion the other day about this issue. I enjoyed it.  But he said that a soft money ban would be unfair to the Republican Party. And this very much reflects the comments of the Senator from Kentucky, who has made similar comments, that a soft money ban would somehow unfairly limit the ability of the Republican Party, as opposed to the Democratic 
   Party. 
   I find this very odd, since the comments this weekend of the chairman designate of the Democratic National Committee, the mayor of Philadelphia, Ed Rendell, who is the chair of the DNC, who said in a column, or was quoted in a column by David Broder:  
   ``If the Republicans pass McCain-Feingold, we would be shut down,'' Rendell said.  
   So both parties apparently think it is the end of the line for them if we ban soft money--but only for one of them. I ask, how is it possible, since this whole soft money thing only happened 3 or 4 years ago in terms of the vast amounts of money? We certainly had political parties before this--pretty good political parties. How can both parties be right? How can the Senator from Colorado be right and Mr. Rendell be right? 
   The fact is, both parties have become addicted to soft money, and they do not want to give it up. There is no reality to the notion that the parties will be crippled or any particular party would be severely harmed by the soft money ban. 
   Mr. President, I wanted to make that point. At this point, since we are roughly trying to go back and forth, I hope the Senator from Massachusetts could proceed.

   I would ask the Senator from Arizona, when we take this vote on tabling, will you regard this vote on the Reid amendment as a true test of the question we have been asking our colleagues, and that question is, Are you for or against soft money? 
   Would the Senator from Arizona regard that vote as a procedural vote or a vote up or down on the question of whether you are for or against soft money?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Again, I ask a further question. I appreciate that answer because I think the problem we have had is we have not had a chance to get to the question of whether you are for or against unlimited contributions. For year after year, it appears that--and I ask the Senator from Arizona to confirm--we keep trying to get to this vote, but we never seem to be able to get right at it; the bill is pulled or a tabling motion is made on the overall bill or something, a cloture motion is filed. It is amazing, after 5 years, we have never gotten to this. But apparently we are about to. 
   Let me ask one other question, if I could, because the Senator from Oregon consulted me on this. Senator WYDEN, who does not limit himself to supporting our efforts, has been, in my mind, one of the strongest advocates of campaign finance reform in this body. He has been creative and has a number of interesting ideas of his own that I like very much. He asked me--and I certainly think you will answer the same way I did--whether or not, after this motion is disposed of one way or another, Senators will still have the chance to amend the bill.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, in a few minutes, the Senate, for the first time--let me reiterate that--for the first time, the Senate will go on record on the central issue in this debate: Should the Senate ban soft money? 
   It is a simple question that has a simple answer. And soon, finally, we will see where each Senator stands. 
   The fact that our current campaign finance system has created an appearance of corruption justifies Congress acting to ban soft money. In fact, if we don't act, we create the appearance that we don't care about corruption. Creating a legislative record of the appearance of corruption is critical because the Supreme Court has held that not just actual corruption but an appearance of corruption is adequate reason for the restrictions on the speech represented by campaign contribution limits. 
   Madam President, this is the central misunderstanding or flaw in the opposition's position. They have premised everything in this debate on the idea that you have to show individual Senators who are guilty of corruption. Well, of course, that isn't the standard at all. That isn't the law. Let me quote from the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley v. Valeo because this is a crucial concept that opponents of reform often seek to ignore. The Court said:  
   Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.  
   Madam President, I really don't think there is any doubt that our current system presents the appearance of corruption. And it isn't just soft money. We see it every day in the newspapers, and we hear it on television talk shows. It is portrayed as common knowledge, conventional wisdom, on radio talk shows that the votes of politicians are bought and paid for by special interests. When the Senator from Kentucky stands up and says that ``people contribute to our campaigns because they agree with what we are doing,'' I am sure he is sincere, but the public thinks there is something more than general feelings of support or like-mindedness at work when somebody hands over hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
   Let me give some examples of news stories in just the last three weeks that drive this point home. All of them make it perfectly clear to me, and I think to almost any American, that political donations are generally a way of attempting to buy influence and access. All of them add to the record that there is an appearance of corruption out there that justifies the Congress taking action to ban soft money. 
   Madam President, if this applies to hard money contributions, it surely must apply far more easily and obviously to soft money contributions.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this article reports that former Representative Bill Paxon, who retired last year, has signed with the law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer and Feld. Akin Gump is one of the powerhouse lobbying firms in Washington. Its partners include big name Democrats Robert Strauss and Vernon Jordan. Paxon is not a lawyer, so his title is ``senior advisor.'' What that means is that he will be a lobbyist and ``rainmaker'' for the firm. 
   Apparently, Akin Gump, a firm known for its Democratic Party ties, hired Mr. Paxon to ``mend fences'' with the Republican Party. And how does Mr. Paxon do that? According to this article, the main thing he does is raise money for Republican Members of Congress and the Republican Party. The National Journal reports that Paxon has helped host 20 fundraisers for the Speaker of the House, the House majority whip, the assistant majority leader in the Senate, and other Republican office holders. He has also raised more than $250,000 for an NRCC dinner, and another $150,000 for a Republican House-Senate dinner this year. He has raised over $100,000 for Presidential candidate George W. Bush. 
   Let me quote from the article:  
   Not surprisingly, NRCC chairman, Tom Davis of Virginia, is a huge Paxon fan. ``Bill is still a very integral part of the culture over here,'' said Davis, who talks to Paxon a couple of times a week. ``He's been helpful in building bridges to groups. I consider him a right arm up here.''  
   The article reports that Mr. Paxon participates in a weekly meeting that lobbyists hold with Majority Whip DELAY and meets regularly with Speaker HASTERT.  
   The article continues:  
   Paxon's fundraising skills, plus the experience he gained during five terms in Congress, have seemingly proved magnets for new business. Although he is barred by ethics rules from lobbying on Capitol Hill until next year, Paxon said he offers clients a cornucopia of other services.  
   Madam President, let's leave aside the revolving door problems in Mr. Paxon participating in weekly meetings that Mr. DELAY holds with lobbyists. Can there be any question that that is an appearance problem? Here we have a former Member of Congress whose stock in trade is raising big money for congressional leaders and candidates. Do we really blame the public for thinking he is getting special treatment for his clients? 
   Mr. DAVIS calls him an integral part of the culture over here. Just what kind of culture is this? Certainly not the kind of culture I would be proud to tell my children and grandchildren about. Certainly not a culture that we should nourish and preserve for the future of our democracy. 
   He is a right arm for the congressional leadership? The public might be excused for asking: Just who is the right arm for whom in this relationship? 
   Exhibit B. On October 5, the day before the House considered the Patients'  Bill of Rights, according to press reports, officials for Cigna, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, and Aetna held a $1,000 per plate breakfast fundraiser for the Speaker of the House. Press reports the next day said that 15 or 17 health insurance industry lobbyists attended the event. Atlanta Constitution columnist Tom Baxter wrote the following:  
   The condition of the political ground could be judged by the keen attention of all the television networks to a breakfast fund-raiser this week at which insurance lobbyists arrived with checks for Hastert and others. Not that such scenes aren't common these days, but the timing made this a photo-op for campaign finance reform.  
   Indeed. I remember seeing reports on the national TV news about this event. And I thought to myself: ``what can the average American watching on TV think about this scene?'' ``How can anyone not think this is wrong?'' Actual corruption? We will never know. The appearance of corruption? Without a doubt. The headline of this AP news story tells it all: ``Insurers Give Speaker Thousands on Eve of Vote.''

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, an article that appeared in the Capitol Hill newspaper The Hill on September 29. Here's another great headline: ``Why 30 top Democratic lobbyists attended GOP chairman's bash.'' 
   This article reports however, that 30 top Democratic lobbyists attended a fundraising dinner for a Republican committee chairman at the home of Democratic super-lobbyist Tommy Boggs. 
   I bring this article to the attention of the Senate not to cast aspersions on any Senator. My interest in this article is in the views of lobbyists on fundraising, and the appearance it creates for the public that reads about it. 
   Let me quote from the article: ``Indeed, it would be tantamount to political suicide for Democratic lobbyists--or Republican lobbyists for that matter--who specialize in the [the issues] that are the focus of [the chairman's] committee and the lifeblood of their corporate clients, if they desert him in his hour of need.'' 
   Here are a few quotes in this article from lobbyists who were questioned on the irony of Democratic lobbyists making contributions to a powerful Republican chairman of a Senate committee. One said: ``In situations like this, I tend to be a strong fan of incumbency.'' Another said, ``Most lobbyists know which side their bread is buttered on.'' And this is what a staffer on the House side had to say: ``Any time you have a chairman of [a committee] running for reelection, and you're lobbying ..... issues before the committee, you risk having your issue blown out of the water if you don't contribute to his campaign. The game in this town is to support the incumbent. 
   Mr. President, I don't suggest that these lobbyists bearing gifts have swayed or will sway a chairman on substantive issues, but they sure are trying. And I have avoided using the Senator's name because I don't think he has been swayed. But we all have to admit that these kind of comments create a perception, an appearance, that campaign contributions are given because of the effect they will have on policy. 
   Madam President, let me anticipate a question by the Senator from Kentucky. Most of the fundraising in these articles is hard money fundraising, isn't it? It is all legal under our system. Thousand-dollar checks to candidates are permitted under the Federal election laws, aren't they? The answer, of course, is yes. But what strikes me is the obvious appearance of corruption that is present when a lobbyist specializes in throwing fundraisers for candidates or when members of Congress solicit even these relatively small donations from people with an interest in legislation, especially on the eve of a crucial vote. 
   Madam President, can there be any doubt that an outrageous appearance of corruption arises when the same Members of Congress are involved in raising hundreds of thousands of dollars of soft money in a single phone call for the political parties? As Justice Souter said just a few weeks ago at the oral argument in the Missouri case--``Most people assume, and I do certainly, that someone making an extraordinarily large contribution gets something extraordinary in return.'' 
   That brings me to another exhibit in our legislative record of the appearance of corruption--a story that appeared yesterday in the Washington Post about the effort that the Democratic party--my party--is making to raise soft money in order to retake the Congress. According to the article, the Democrat Congressional Campaign Committee increased its soft money fundraising from $5.1 million in 1994 to $16.6 million in the '98 cycle. It is now going after the really big givers with an innovation called Team 2000. The Post story describes Team 2000 as ``[A] new club for $100,000 and over donors who would be feted by the party at exclusive events, including a weekend of clambakes and sightseeing.'' 
   The article describes the wooing of Steven Wynn, owner of Mirage Resorts in Las Vegas, who gave a $250,000 contribution to the DCCC in May of this year. The article indicates that Wynn is angry about the impeachment of the President and with the Republican failure to stop the antigaming crusade of a Member of the House. 
   Incidentally, this information is not included in this particular article, but  I have learned that the Mirage Resorts gave an identical $250,000 amount to the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee in July of this year. 
   So I guess Mr. Wynn got over his anger and realized that he had better play both sides of the fence, as many big soft money donors do.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, how can we close our eyes to the appearance of corruption that this enormous fundraising effort provides? How can we close our eyes to the appearance of corruption that the double givers list that I have shown on this floor a number of times represents? Mirage Resorts is now on the list. Companies give hundreds of thousands of dollars to both political parties--hundreds of thousands of dollars to both political parties. What game are they playing here? 
   The Senator from Kentucky said on the floor last week, ``Well, they have a right to be duplicitous.'' Actually, Madam President, they are not being duplicitous. We all know they are giving to both sides. They are just playing by the rules as we have set them up. They are not doing anything that is dishonest. They are simply trying to cover their bases. Surely, the Senator from Kentucky doesn't think when AT&T gives a big contribution to the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee that it won't give money to the Senator from New Jersey's Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as well. 
   We all know why they do it, too--because in the candid words of a lobbyist, ``They know which side their bread is buttered on.'' Both sides--the bread is buttered on both sides. They play both sides of the fence so they can get their calls returned and their positions heard. That, my friends, is on its face an appearance of corruption. And if we are so caught up in this fundraising game that we can't see it, the disenchantment the public feels in its elected officials is well warranted. 
   Last week, the Senator from Kentucky suggested that press reports about the connection between campaign donations and legislative actions arise from the desire of newspapers to  sell more copies or talking heads to get air time. But the newspapers didn't create the appearance problem. We did. 
   I am reminded of what the great Senator, Robert La Follette, from my home State of Wisconsin, said in response to those who argued that the press of his day--the early 1900s--was somehow spreading hysteria about the power of the railroads over Congress. La Follette said: 
   It does not lie in the power of any or all of the magazines of the country or of the press, great as it is, to destroy, without justification, the confidence of the people in the American Congress....... It rests solely with the United States Senate to fix and maintain its own reputation for fidelity to public trust. It will be judged by the record. It can not repose in security upon its exalted position and the glorious heritage of its traditions. It is worse than folly to feel, or to profess to feel, indifferent with respect to public judgment. If public confidence is wanting in Congress, it is not of hasty growth, it is not the product of ``jaundiced journalism.'' It is the result of years of disappointment and defeat.  
   Years of disappointment and defeat--that is what the American people have had as the soft money system has grown and Congress has done nothing about it. The system of soft money looks corrupt. Indeed, it is corrupt. And it makes us, as its beneficiaries, look corrupt. 
   There is no other way to put it. There is an appearance of corruption. There is an appearance of cravenness. There is an appearance of a smug confidence that the American people will not laugh out loud in disgust at the assertion that there is no corruption near. There is an appearance of something terribly, terribly wrong that we refuse to fix. 
   If that offends people in this Chamber, so be it. We had better get rid of this system so they won't be offended anymore because I am not going to stop talking about it until we do. 
   Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for his question. 
   The example of the farmer is a wonderful example, because of what has happened in Wisconsin in the last 18 years. We have lost something like 18,000 dairy farmers, so farmers in my State are in no position to be giving even $10 or $25 contributions. 
   When they hear, as the Senator is suggesting, that a person can give even $1,000, the possibility of doing that is pretty much off the charts. When they hear that somebody can actually for the first time in this century give $100,000, it is absolutely disappointing. And it must make them even more despondent. They have enough problems already. 
   But to think they can't have their vote count for what it used to count--we always had in Wisconsin the notion that the farm vote kind of shifted the balance, it is the swing vote traditionally in Wisconsin. But in this kind of system where soft money ads can make a farce out of an election, they feel--I know from firsthand conversations--quite left out of the process and quite dispirited.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I don't think there is any possibility that he feels his voice is as strong as it used to be. A typical farmer in Wisconsin with a certain amount of cows and a certain amount of 
   acreage and a family, those are things that he had. He knew he had those things, and he had his vote counting the same as everybody else's. That is where the whole progressive movement in Wisconsin and the efforts of Robert La Follette came from--a lot of these farmers who were able to put their votes together to elect people who would really represent them.

   We have to send this message and we have to do even better. We have to actually pass a ban on soft money as a first signal to that farmer that we will do the rest of the job and actually return the notion of one person-one vote to that farmer.

These are Republicans who I have grown to know and enjoy working with who together have worked to try to do something to ban soft money. So this is an example of how this institution can work well in terms of our cooperation and bipartisanship.

   Quite a number of them had come out to the floor this afternoon to say they were against banning soft money. So they had a chance to vote not to ban soft money. Why didn't they do that? They threw the vote. They all came out here and unanimously voted not to table the McCain-Feingold bill, which simply bans soft money. Now they do not want to have us meet tomorrow morning.

Is the Senator from New Jersey aware the $276 million estimate of issue advertising in the 1998 cycle, which the Senator has there I believe, includes all issue advertising, not just ads that are so-called phony issue ads?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Fair enough. I wanted to establish that. The chart the Senator from New Jersey is using relates to an entire election cycle, a 2-year period, and it covers all sorts of ads. That means all kinds of true issue ads and so-called phony issue ads, as well as political party ads, are included in his chart. 
   All three categories are in there. That is the basis on which he makes his argument. Is he aware the Shays-Meehan bill--which, of course, Senator MCCAIN and I essentially wrote in the first place--that he has offered as an amendment would have no effect on any ad aired before the last 2 months of an election campaign?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I think this is an extremely useful exchange that really goes to the core question about this legislation. I want to thank the Senator from New Jersey, even though we may come to different conclusions about specific tactics in what we do here. I thank the Senator for allowing us to talk about this because this is really what it is all about. Let me first reiterate my concern and ask a question about the totality of the ads the Senator suggested on his charts. 
   Would the Senator concede that when you are dealing with ads that simply have to do with legislation, prior to 60 days, let's say, for example--the kind of tobacco ads we have seen; the ads we have seen about the Patients' Bill of Rights, the so-called Harry and Louise ads during the health care debate--there is no way under either Shays-Meehan or under McCain-Feingold, or even under any other legislation, we could prohibit those ads? Is that something with which the Senator would agree?

   If it is the case, as the Senator from New Jersey suggests, that banning soft money will cause money to flow to phony issue ads, I think it is also rather difficult to dispute--in fact, you seem to concede--if we prohibit that, that the money will just flow to generic issue ads as well.

   I don't doubt for a minute that the Senator is right, that the attempt will be made to evade the intent of the law, and in some cases it could succeed. But is the Senator aware that the McCain-Feingold soft money ban, the bill we have introduced, will 
   prohibit Federal candidates from raising money for these phony outside groups such as the organization that is connected with Representative DELAY? Are you aware that that provision is actually in this soft money ban?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I further ask the question--I do appreciate these answers--I think when you look at the tough provisions we put in this bill, although nothing is ever perfectly complete if somebody is willing to violate the law and take their chances, but what we are talking about here is corporate executives, CEOs, who now give money directly to political parties, taking the chance of running afoul of these new criminal laws. 
   I have this chart. It is a list of all the soft money double givers. These are corporations that have given over $150,000 to both sides. Under the Senator's logic, these very same corporations--Philip Morris, Joseph Seagram, RJR Nabisco, BankAmerica Corporation--each of these would continue making the same amount of contributions; they would take the chance of violating the law by doing this in coordination with or at the suggestion of the parties, and they would calmly turn over the same kind of cash to others, be it left-wing or right-wing independent groups? 
   I have to say--and I will finish my question--I am skeptical that if they cannot hand the check directly to the political party leaders, they will take those chances. 
   I share your suspicions about some group trying to funnel this money. There is no question that some of that will happen. But wouldn't you concede there has to be some serious risk, in our soft money ban, for these corporations to pull this kind of a stunt?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. One more question, because the Senator from New Jersey has been very generous in responding. 
   The proposition you are advancing appears to be--given this chart, Philip Morris did give almost $500,000 to the Democrats, although they gave $2.5 million to the Republicans--apparently the Senator believes, one way or another, Philip Morris is going to see to it that that kind of money--$500,000-- sees its way to the Sierra Club or NARAL or some kind----

<DOCNO>106-feingold-wi-17-19991015</DOCNO>

   Mr. FEINGOLD. But it will go to that kind of a group. 
   The point I want to reiterate--and I put it in the form of a question--is that the suggestion that a party soft money ban that includes some new tough provisions to protect against evasions of the law would not make a difference, I think, is problematic. 
   We are talking about making these subterfuges, which are currently legal--maybe at the most they are stretching the law--illegal. What Mr. DELAY is doing, from the other body, apparently is right on the line, some would say. Maybe it is legal; maybe it isn't. But we can't say for sure it is illegal. We are making sure in our bill that it is a crime to do this sort of thing. 
   Don't you think it would make a significant difference and raise the bar on the risk for these companies and those individuals to play this game? Isn't it worth taking the chance by banning soft money and having these tough provisions? Isn't it worth giving it a try?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I am very glad the Senator asked me that question. Again, you come to the heart of the matter. Let us look at the language of the bill we have put forward. 
   It does not talk about only what the gentleman from Texas--as we should perhaps refer to him on the floor--would do directly. The language is clear. It says: A candidate, an individual holding Federal office, agent of a candidate or individual holding Federal office, or an entity directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained, controlled by, or acting on behalf of one or more candidates--cannot raise this money. 
   We deal with the indirect problem. It is not possible to have B.B. DeLay become the shell person to do this without running the risk of violating the law. 
   Since you asked me a question this time, I will answer in the form of a question back to you. How can you say to me that we only deal with some of the soft money when the whole exchange we just had made you concede--you clearly conceded--that you can't deal with all the soft money, that there is no way you could ever deal with----

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I think, in the scenario you described, there would be a heck of a case to suggest there is indirect coordination. What you have just described is an obvious scenario.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I would be delighted to have some sort of an investigation of whether or not that is a different organization and has no connection with the party. But if the Senator has some concerns about how we drafted this, if he thinks we need to take the language and tighten it up--I think it is pretty tight--but we would be delighted to try to make this tougher. You are right. We shouldn't let anybody do this by ruse. What you described is a ruse.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to make one comment, if I could, in response to that. Excuse me, to the Senator from Utah. 
   Let me again thank you and, of course, reiterate, I helped write those provisions in Shays-Meehan. I would love to see them passed. It would do more than the bill we are now proposing. But the notion that it isn't worth it, if that is all we can do--and that is something we disagree on and we will debate in a few minutes, I hope--the notion that it isn't worth it to ban these giant direct contributions to the parties, as well as the various attempted ways to try to get around the ban, which we seek to do, to not do that, to suggest that not doing that alone isn't worth it and it is worse than the status quo, to me, is absurd. 
   Let me reiterate, I do support the language of Shays-Meehan. 
   But the question that is crucial is whether or not it is at all possible to get 60 votes for that. I suggest stopping this is well worth doing. 
   I thank the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we have had an excellent debate so far. I am pleased to have an opportunity to make a few comments essentially in summary on what we have covered. 
   We have been debating an amendment. In fact, we have been debating two amendments. We have been debating two alternatives, both of which I like very much. One of them is the original version of the McCain-Feingold bill, which is very similar to the Shays-Meehan bill that has been offered, and the other is essentially the underlying bill, the approach of simply banning soft money. We think that is well worth doing if we can get nothing else out of the Senate. 
   I want to make it very clear. I, like my leader, the Senator from South Dakota, also support comprehensive reform. It is even a little bit amusing to me because I remember we had the first version of the McCain-Feingold bill. And when the decision was made to make it a little bit lighter in order to get more support, there was outcry by some that we had abandoned comprehensive reform. 
   What is now the Shays-Meehan bill was said at that time not to be comprehensive, but today the Shays-Meehan bill is being called comprehensive reform. 
   It is not comprehensive, I am the first to admit; not only that bill, not only our bill, but any of the bills that have been offered, including the original McCain-Feingold bill. I prefer public financing. So the question isn't: Is this bill comprehensive reform? There is no comprehensive reform being offered on the floor of the Senate in this debate. The question is whether we are advancing the cause of campaign finance reform in a meaningful way with these different alternatives. 
   I think either alternative, Shays-Meehan or the McCain-Feingold soft money ban, does advance the cause of campaign finance reform. 
   Then there are only two questions in deciding which approach to follow at this point in this Senate. The first question is: Can it pass? Can the legislation get over the filibuster in the Senate? The second question, and it is as important as the first question, maybe more important: Is it worth it to pass the bill assuming we can do it? That is the issue we have to address. 
   On the first question, what can be passed in this body? I would love and have fought long and hard for years to be able to pass a bill through this body that includes not only a ban on soft money but that also deals with the phony issue ads that almost every American knows are campaign ads. But unlike the Senator from New Jersey, I have taken the time to sit down individually with every Republican Senator who has not supported our side in the past, who I thought might support our side on a pure soft money ban or some other alternative. 
   I asked each Member what they want to see in a campaign finance reform bill. I did this largely with the help and special extra effort not only of Senator MCCAIN, but also the Senator from Maine. This was a process we undertook in May and June and that continues today. I believe these Senators were being sincere with me. Some said they would not support anything and enjoyed the conversation. Some told me maybe there was a way they could support a stronger bill. The underlying theme from these conversations was whereas they couldn't support the provisions having to do with phony issue ads, many of them were open to the possibility of simply banning soft money. Some said: Let's ban soft money and do a couple of other things, too. 
   There was a thread that came through all of these conversations. I can say to my colleagues with absolute certainty: I don't believe there is any scenario where the phony issue ads issue can be dealt with in this body on this piece of legislation. We cannot get 60 votes for it. And if we don't get 60 votes, the efforts in the House a few weeks ago that were so admirable are wasted. The House passed a bill that has both the soft money ban, and good provisions dealing with the phony issue ads. If we don't pass a bill in the Senate at all, we all know the process. This isn't Nebraska; it is not a unicameral legislature. There are two Houses. If we can't get a bill out of this body, there can't be a conference; or if the House can't agree to the Senate position, we can't have campaign finance reform. 
   As great as the Shays-Meehan approach or the original McCain-Feingold approach is, I guarantee, I know we can't get 60 votes for that approach in this Senate at this stage of the process. 
   It is fair to ask whether or not we can pass the soft money ban. We don't know for sure. But we do know this: This long, difficult battle has been won, one piece at a time. We are going to win it. The claim originally was, we only have a few supporters. Then the claim was, we just have Democrats and Senator MCCAIN and Senator THOMPSON; we don't have a third Republican. Then Senator COLLINS came on board. Then Senator SPECTER came on board. Then they said, there are only 49 votes; you don't have a 
   majority, so you can't win. Then we were very fortunate to gain the support of three Senators--Senators SNOWE, JEFFORDS, and CHAFEE, and we had a majority in the Senate. Then they said, you can't get 60 votes. 
   Fair enough. We know we need 60 votes, if people want to play the game that way--and it is the way it is often played in the Senate to win. For the last year, we have needed eight votes; we need eight votes. Because we had made the decision to listen to our Republican colleagues who were willing to listen, to try to just do a soft money ban if we can't do anything else, we now only need seven votes, as the Senator from Kansas, Mr. BROWNBACK, has cosponsored the McCain-Feingold bill to ban soft money. Now it is seven. 
   Maybe in a couple of days it will be five or three or two. The point is, in this game we lose and lose and lose and lose until we win, and we only have to win once. That is what legislating is all about. We can win. We must find out whether it is possible to win by finding out how many Members of this body answer the following question with a yes or a no. The question is, Are you for or against party soft money? 
   Do you think people should be able to give unlimited contributions to the political parties, $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, $1 million--even though corporations and unions have been prohibited from doing that for decades in the United States? That is the question. Are Members for soft money or are they against soft money? Are they for a system of legalized bribery or against a system of legalized bribery? That is the question. 
   I do believe there is no contest, no question as to which approach is most likely to break the filibuster. It is the approach of simply banning soft money. 
   That leads to the second question, and this is the excellent exchange we had with Senator TORRICELLI today. It was all about whether it will make a difference, whether it is worth it, whether it will do anything at all if we are able to only ban party soft money. It is a fair question because I don't think there is any doubt there will always be attempts to avoid the ban and have the money flow to other sources. 
   But my belief that it would make a huge difference to ban party soft money in this process is not some kind of utopian version. It is not some kind of a millennial fervor about being able to sever the connection between money and politics. I believe that is eternal. There will always be some connection between money and politics. 
   The question is whether we can do something to close an outrageous loophole that has caused America to not have a campaign finance reform system at all--which is exactly what the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. THOMPSON, has said on many occasions. That is the question. Is it worth closing this loophole? 
   Senator MCCAIN said it well. We may have to do more. Even this attempt may in 10 years be void. It is similar to tax reform. Nobody thinks when we do tax reform, as we did in 1986, that it is forever. It works for a while and we have to come back and do it again.  That is why the Senator from Arizona said we don't adjourn permanently. Problems recur. Thomas Jefferson even said we should have a revolution every 20 years. Surely, it is not such a bad thing if we have campaign finance reform attempted every 20 years. 
   I do think it is worth it. The reason I think it is worth it is because of the staggering figures I think many Americans are not aware of which are demonstrated on this chart. Do the American people know the kind of money that is being given to the political parties in this country, in a country that is supposed to be based on the principle of one person, one vote? How can they believe they are operating under a system of one person, one vote when enormous contributions can be given by corporations, unions, and individuals that make a farce out of the Watergate era reforms? 
   These figures bear repetition. In 1992, 52 people gave over $200,000 to one of the major political petitioners. That is a lot. But by 1996, 219 people had given over $200,000. What about over $300,000? In 1992, only 20 people had given $300,000 to the major political parties. That figure sextupled--120 people instead of 20 gave in 1996 that amount. 
   What about those who gave $400,000? These aren't groups that represent a bunch of individuals. These are one individual or one union or one corporation, each giving $400,000. Thirteen entities or persons did that in 1992, but in 1996 it was 1979. 
   Finally, $500,000, a half a million dollars--people or corporations or unions giving a half a million dollars to one of the political parties: there were 9 people or groups who did that in 1992; by 1996 it was 50. I can just imagine what that figure is going to look like in the year 2000. It will be enormous. In a system where people are supposed to generally have their votes count the same, some people get to give these unlimited contributions to the national political parties. 
   To tie this into the debate from yesterday about the issue of corruption and the appearance of corruption, I reminded my colleagues after the exchange here that the test that the Supreme Court has put forward as to whether you can ban contributions or limit contributions is whether there is corruption or the appearance of corruption. All I needed to do to drive this point home was to open up the newspaper this morning and on the front page of the Washington Post see this headline:  
   Microsoft Targets Funding For Antitrust Office.   
   Apparently Microsoft and their allies are not seeking to directly affect the litigation that is being conducted with regard to Microsoft by the Justice Department at this time; what they are trying to do, according to this article, is cut the overall funding for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. In this context, if somehow things don't look right, there is the ever present possibility that there would be an appearance of corruption. It just so happens on the plane out here, next to my seat there was a copy of Forbes magazine and the Forbes 400. I read the whole thing. 
   I found out to be in the Forbes 400 now it is not enough to have half a billion dollars. You are not on the team if you're only worth half a billion. You get kicked off the Forbes 400 list. You have to have $620 million to be on the Forbes 400 list. 
   Who do you think led that list? Who do you think was the lead in the whole thing? It was the Microsoft executive, of course, and Mr. Gates himself is so much more wealthy than the next wealthiest person that it is absolutely staggering. 
   One chart in the magazine article showed five or six people and how their wealth was greater than the wealth of various countries. They put the picture of the head of the person next to the wealth of the country. In this context, where Microsoft wants the Justice Department's budget cut, to have a scenario where corporations and unions and individuals can give unlimited amounts of soft money certainly creates the potential for an appearance of corruption. 
   I have no idea what Microsoft's or Bill Gates' actual contributions are, and I am not suggesting that they are making those contributions to influence the funding of the Justice Department. But for us to create a scenario where Mr. Gates could give unlimited amounts of money rather than the old $2,000 of hard money, or a Microsoft PAC could give more than $10,000, to just have it be unlimited I believe almost inherently, as the Supreme Court would say, creates an appearance of corruption that is bad for Microsoft, bad for the Justice Department, and bad for our country. 
   We have never permitted this in the past. We have never permitted corporations to give this kind of money. We have never permitted unions to give this kind of money. Essentially in the last 5 years, one way to describe this: This kind of negative influence of money and politics, which will always be there, has gone from the retail--$2,000, $10,000--to the wholesale side. We now have the wholesale purchase of public policy, or the appearance thereof, in this country. 
   I will simply quote from a Minneapolis Star Tribune editorial from October 13, 1999. This summarizes this very well, the fact that it is worth it to prohibit corporations and unions and individuals from giving unlimited contributions to the political parties. The editorial says: 
   Later this week, when the Senate tries again to pass campaign-finance reform, opponents will argue that Congress shouldn't abridge the right of citizens to express their opinions through their checkbooks. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republicans' legendary fund-raiser from Kentucky, told the Washington Post this week: ``Somebody needs to protect the right of Americans to project their message.'' 
   This is a plausible argument in a society that values free speech. Except that some of the people with the biggest checkbooks say it's a load of bunk. 
   Listen to Rob Johnson, corporate vice president for public affairs at Cargill Inc.: ``Even if money doesn't buy influence, it is perceived to buy influence. That perception erodes peoples' confidence in their government and their willingness to participate in the electoral process.'' 
   Consider Marilyn Carlson Nelson of the Carlson Companies, or James Porter, a vice president at Honeywell. Both are active in the Committee for Economic Development (CED), a New York study group of influential corporate executives. After researching the cost of political campaigns, the CED concluded last summer: `Candidates spend an inordinate amount of time fundraising, reducing the time they spend communicating their ideas to constituents.'' 
   If these powerful executives--the very people who might benefit most from checkbook politics--can see the corrupting influence of money in campaigns, it's astonishing that the Senate cannot. 
   And yet reform will almost certainly die in the Senate this month, for the third time in as many years. Though a promising bill just passed the House and has majority support in the Senate, reformers cannot muster the votes to break a GOP filibuster. 
   The point is not that big donors always get their way. Populists can point to the occasional victory--the recent House vote on patient' rights, for example, or President Clinton's veto of the big GOP tax cut. 
   The point is that big money has taken politics out of the hands of citizens and delivered it into the hands of cynics. Promising candidates refuse to run for office because they can't face begging for cash. Talented incumbents shirk their legislative work to raise money for the next campaign. Citizen volunteers drop out of politics because the old forms of participation--pounding lawn signs and calling neighbors--have given way to slick direct mail and vicious TV spots. Voters eventully understand that politcs no longer belongs to them. 
   The bill that comes before the Senate this week--a whittled-down reform written by Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Russell Feingold of Wisconsin--wouldn't revoluntionize politics. It would merely ban ``soft money,'' the unregulated form of contributions that has spiraled out of control in recent years. But banning soft money would at least be a start toward healthier politics. Alas, that start must likely await another year, and a Congress with more courage. 
   After three fruitless years, the reform effort has grown demoralizing. And yet the marathon debate is useful--it brings new critics to their feet, whets the outrage of intelligent citizens, and drives the obstructionists to ever more desperate tactics.  
   This is a good statement of why it is worth it to ban this kind of outrageous abuse of our American democracy. 
   Justice Souter said it very well at the oral argument in the Shrink Missouri Government PAC case just a few days ago; which I had a chance to attend. I know this was just a comment from the bench. We don't know what the ruling will be. But Justice Souter described exactly what these giant contributions have to mean to almost any American. He said:  
   Most people assume, and I do, certainly, that someone making an extraordinarily large contribution gets something extraordinary in return.   
   I am sure the Court will take notice, if we ever get to that point, that many Americans share that view, and it is very significant that one of the great Justices of the Supreme Court took notice that it gives him the feeling there is an appearance of corruption in this system. 
   To finally respond to the point the Senator from New Jersey made, the Senator from New Jersey said--I don't know what his historical basis for this is, but it is an interesting comment: ``We only get a chance once every 10 years to do campaign finance reform.'' He said that is why we had to do the Shays-Meehan approach rather than the soft money ban. 
   But this is what I know to be true. Not only is it worth it to ban soft money, but if we don't take this opportunity to at least ban soft money, there will be no campaign finance reform at all during the 1990s. The opportunity to have any campaign finance reform will have been destroyed by Congress after Congress after Congress. This is our chance to break down this system that is destroying anybody's sense that there is a system of one person one vote in the United States anymore. 
   This is a chance. This is the one we must take. This is the one on which we must have a yes-or-no vote early next week. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his question. I first compliment him. Not only has he, obviously, done a good job when he was in the role of being a leader for our political party committee, which involved fundraising, but he has always been an ardent supporter of campaign finance reform at the same time. He knows very well because he was involved. 
   The fact that people do not have a lot of money can keep them out of politics. It almost kept me out of politics. That is the reason I got involved in this issue in the first place. I certainly was not aware of what soft money was at that time. 
   In answer to the Senator's question, this clearly is not comprehensive reform; Shays-Meehan is not comprehensive reform. But when we get to the point of simply banning soft money, we 
   should take the opportunity. 
   In specific answer to his question about what happens when these amendments come up, all I can do is tip my hat and say let's follow the example of the other body which, on two occasions, has shown us what to do. 
   You have to be willing on some occasions to vote against a good amendment in which you believe--I am even prepared, if necessary, to vote against a bill that has my name on it--if you believe the reason for putting that amendment on is to destroy the chance to pass a reasonable and appropriate bill. They had to do that in the House. Members had to vote against amendments that had to do with disclosure, almost an indisputable principle. They had to vote against other amendments they liked very much in order to make sure they could pass a reasonable bill, such as the Shays-Meehan bill, that included a number of important provisions. 
   We have to be ready to do the same thing. I believe in some cases, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, the amendments that will be offered will be helpful and do not threaten our ability to win, but in some cases I think they are poison pills and we need to work together to defeat them. I am confident we have a majority of people in this body who are reformers and understand the importance of taking the vote you have to take in order to win this battle.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I can respond briefly, I cannot think of a more helpful remark than what the Senator from Nebraska just said. What he is talking about--and this is his nature--is to actually get something done. Not just posture but actually accomplish something. I am grateful because that is the discipline we are going to need when we start voting next week.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I have the distinct honor of submitting a resolution that commemorates one of the great vessels in our naval history and her crew members. I am joined by the senior Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. KOHL. 
   Mr. President, the U.S.S. Wisconsin is one of four Iowa-class battleships, the largest battleships ever built by the Navy. The four vessels, the Wisconsin, the Iowa, the New Jersey and the Missouri, served gallantly in every significant United States conflict from World War II to the Persian Gulf war. 
   At 887 feet, the Wisconsin carries a 108-foot, three-inch beam with a displacement of 45,000 tons. Her armor includes 9 sixteen-inch guns, 20 five-inch guns, 80 40-millimeter guns, and 49 20-millimeter guns. The 16-inch guns can lob shells roughly the weight of a VW Beetle to distances of up to 24 miles. The recoil of these might guns was so great that the deck had to be built of teak wood because steel plating would buckle from the stress. She was designed for a crew of 1,921 sailors, but she carried as many as 2,700 sailors during World War II and the Korean war. 
   Mr. President, the U.S.S. Wisconsin was built in Philadelphia and commissioned on 7 December 1943, exactly 2 years after the attack on Pearl Harbor. From the moment President Roosevelt selected the name of the vessel, Wisconsin citizens took an immediate interest. School children volunteered to christen the battleship. Some folks even recommended christening the Wisconsin with water from the Wisconsin River, instead of champagne. 
   In the summer of 1944, she underwent sea trials and training in the Chesapeake Bay. On 7 July, the Wisconsin departed from Norfolk, VA, on her way to war with the legendary Adm. William F. ``Bull'' Halsey and his 3rd Fleet. As U.S. Marines and infantry began their island-hopping strategy toward the home islands of Japan, Wisconsin sent her shells hurling with deadly accuracy into the Philippines. And coincidentally enough, the Wisconsin's first commander, Captain Earl E. Stone, was born in Milwaukee and attended the city's public schools and the State university before his appointment to the Naval Academy. 
   The Wisconsin then joined the 5th Fleet under another legendary commander, Adm. Raymond Spruance, and helped silence Japanese resistance on  Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and then joined in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Soon thereafter, the U.S.S. Wisconsin became part of Fast Carrier Task Force 38. She joined in attacks in the Philippine Islands, Saigon, Camranh Bay, Hong Kong, Canton, Hainan, and the Japanese 
   home islands. 
   After the Japanese surrender, the Wisconsin headed home with five battle stars to her credit. One amazing fact about her World War II service is that the Wisconsin didn't lose one crewman or get hit. 
   She spent the summer at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard where she underwent an extensive overhaul. Following a 2-year stint as a training ship, she returned to Norfolk and joined the Atlantic Fleet Reserve Fleet for inactivation. 
   By July 1, 1948, she was taken out of commission and mothballed. However, the Korean war reawakened the Wisconsin and her sister battleships. She departed Norfolk on October 25, 1951, bound for the Pacific where she became the flagship of the 7th Fleet. When the Korean war broke out, future Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, Jr., served as the Wisconsin's navigator and extolled her ``versatility, maneuverability, strength, and power.'' During the conflict, she covered troop landings; fired upon enemy troops, trains, trucks, and bridges all along the Korean coastline; and attacked important North Korean ports in Hungnam, Wonsan, and Songjin. In April 1952, she steamed toward Norfolk with another battle star. 
   Upon arriving in Norfolk, Wisconsin received her second overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Following a number of peacetime and diplomatic voyages showing the flag, she returned to Norfolk on June 11, 1954 for a brief overhaul before taking her role as a training ship. 
   On May 6, 1954, she was cruising off the Virginia Capes in heavy fog when she collided with the destroyer U.S.S. Eaton. Wisconsin returned to Norfolk with extensive bow damage, and a week later found herself back in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Shipyard workers fitted a 120-ton, 68-foot bow section from the unfinished Iowa-class battleship Kentucky. Working round-the-clock, Wisconsin's ship's force and shipyard personnel completed the operation in just 16 days. 
   On June 28, 1956, the ship was ready for sea. Wisconsin steamed from Norfolk five more times before heading for Philadelphia and deactivation in 1958. She remained on inactive status until 1986, when she was towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. In 1988, the U.S.S. Wisconsin was re-commissioned for a third time. 
   In 1991, she led the Navy's surface attack on Iraq during the Gulf war with the first-ever use of cruise missiles in battle. 
   Now, Mr. President, she is decommissioned and will soon be berthed at Nauticus, the National Maritime Museum in Norfolk, VA, where she will serve as a floating monument and an educational museum. I wish she had found her final port in the great State of Wisconsin, but getting her there simply isn't possible--she's just too big. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will help me and the senior Senator from Wisconsin honor this great ship with a commemorative stamp.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations conference report. 
   Back in June, I lamented the Senate's unwillingness to scrutinize the Pentagon's profligate spending. During the Senate's debate of the DoD appropriations bill, we had exactly two amendments worthy of extensive debate. Two amendments, Mr. President. Here we have a defense policy that perpetuates a cold war mentality into the 21st century, and the Senate gave the Defense Department a pass. 
   Now we come to the conference report. I took some satisfaction from the F-22 drama that played out in conference, but the final act was rather predictable. Other than the F-22 program, however, did anyone question the Pentagon's continuing failure to adapt its priorities to the post-cold-war era? Clearly not. 
   And who is left to pay for this $268 billion debacle? Who else but the American taxpayers. 
   The Senate debated recently the wisdom of using across-the-board spending cuts as a budget tool. 
   This conference report is the best argument against that strategy. We need look no further than this bill to find billions of dollars in wasteful spending that could be cut to avoid reductions in programs that are truly justified--including Defense Department programs. 
   As we did last year, we are again in danger of breaking the spending caps agreed to in 1997, and as the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee was reported to have said, military spending will be the force that breaks them. 
   This bloated bill contains billions of dollars in spending that is simply unjustified. It spends even more than was requested by the Pentagon, a level that was already too high. 
   Let me take just one example--the tactical aircraft programs. 
   My opinion on the Navy's F/A-18E/F program is well known. I have not been shy about highlighting the program's myriad flaws, not least of which are its inflated cost with respect to its capabilities. 
   I have to admit, though, that the Super Hornet program can claim to build on a solid foundation, in the form of the reliable, cost-effective Hornet. The Air Force's F-22 program, on the other hand, is a brand new program. It is the most expensive fighter aircraft in the history of the world and arguably the most complex, yet it completed just 4 percent, or about 183 hours, of its flight test program before the Pentagon approved $651 million in production money. The completed flight test hours were about a quarter of the Air Force's own guidelines. In comparison, the F-15 flew for 975 hours before a production contract award; the F-16 for 1,115 hours; and even the much-flawed Super Hornet had 779 flight test hours before a production contract was awarded. Let me remind my colleagues that the flight test program hasn't even tested the aircraft's much-touted stealth or its electronics capabilities. 
   My primary concern with this program is its cost. This cold war anachronism will cost about $200 million a copy. Add this program's cost to the E/F and the Joint Strike Fighter, and we have a $340 billion fiscal nightmare on our hands. We cannot afford this. CBO knows it; GAO knows it; the CATO Institute knows it; the Brookings Institution knows it. The Congress, however, cannot seem to figure it out. 
   I know that some folks will talk about how this conference report puts the program under greater scrutiny and that it delays the aircraft's production, but let's be honest. Barring the discovery, and admission, of some enormous flaw, this conference report holds off the inevitable for just a year. This report postpones production of the Air Force's F-22 fighter plane until April 2001, but refrains from eliminating the program, as was done by the House. 
   The report provides $1.9 billion to purchase up to six planes, under the scope of research and development and testing and evaluation. It even spends $277 for advanced procurement. That is something. The program is supposed to be under a microscope, but we still put up more than a quarter of a billion dollars for advanced procurement. If that is not a clear indication of the plane's future, I do not know what is. And just to cover both ends, the report establishes a 
   $300 million reserve fund to cover any liabilities the Air Force might incur as a result of terminating the program's contracts. That's an awfully generous insurance policy given the trouble we're going through to fund other important programs, like veterans health care and education. 
   As long as we are talking about money, I would like to take this opportunity to Call the Bankroll on the money that has poured into the coffers of candidates and political party committees from the defense contractors who have mounted a huge campaign to keep the F-22 alive. 
   First, we have defense contracting giant Lockheed Martin, the primary developer of the F-22. Lockheed Martin gave nearly $300,000 in soft money and more than $1 million in PAC money in the last election cycle. 
   During that same period, Boeing, one of the chief developers and producers of the F-22's airframe, gave more than $335,000 in soft money to the parties and more than $850,000 in PAC money to candidates. 
   Then there are the subcontractors for the F-22, who account for more than half the total dollar value of the project. 
   Four of the most important subcontractors, according to the F-22's own literature, are TRW, Raytheon, Hughes Electronics and Northrop Grumman. 
   And I guess it should come as little surprise to us to find that these major subcontractors also happened to be major political donors in the last election cycle. 
   Raytheon tops this list with nearly $220,000 in soft money and more than $465,000 in PAC money. 
   Northrop Grumman gave more than $100,000 in soft money to the parties and more than $450,000 in PAC money to candidates. 
   Hughes gave nearly $145,000 in PAC money during 1997 and 1998, and last but not least, TRW gave close to $200,000 in soft money and more than $235,000 in PAC money. 
   The F-22 program, and TacAir in general, highlights the Defense Department's flawed weapons modernization strategy. And today I Call the Bankroll to highlight how the corrupt campaign finance system encourages that flawed strategy--by creating an endless money chase that asks this body to put the interests of a few wealthy donors ahead of the best interests of our national defense. 
   The flawed strategy makes it impossible to buy enough new weapons to replace all the old weapons on a timely basis, even though forces are much smaller than they were during the cold  war and modernization budgets are projected to return to cold war levels. Consequently, the ratio of old weapons to new weapons in our active inventories will grow to unprecedented levels over the next decade. 
   Subsequently, that modernization strategy is driving up the operating budgets needed to maintain adequate readiness, even though the size of our forces is now smaller than it was during the cold war. Each new generation of high complexity weapons costs much more to operate than its predecessor, and the low rate of replacement forces the longer retention and use of older weapons. Thus, as weapons get older, they become more expensive to operate, maintain, and supply. 
   Supporting the Defense Department's misguided spending priorities is not synonymous with supporting the military.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate is once again going to consider campaign finance reform. 
   I thank the senior Senator from Arizona. We have been at this effort now for almost 5 years. He has done so much, particularly in the last year, to raise this issue, not only within this body but throughout America. It has made an incredible difference in terms of the public's understanding, particularly of the problem soft money causes. 
   I also take note of one other Senator. There are many who have worked so hard on this, but I simply have to note the extreme dedication, hard work, and effectiveness of the Senator from Maine, SUSAN COLLINS, who has devoted herself to this cause as well. 
   This is not only a crucial issue to the health and future of the Congress but also for our democracy itself. My colleagues know it is my strong belief that this issue affects virtually everything we do in this Chamber. 
   I have spoken about the need for reform numerous times this year--15 times. Today is the 16th--on the Department of Defense appropriations bill. I call this the ``calling of the bankroll'' on specific campaign contributors with an interest in the bills we have considered. 
   Now the Senate has finally a chance to act. I am hopeful, as we begin this debate, that we can reach a consensus during the next few days and pass a campaign finance reform bill the House can accept and the President can sign. 
   This debate will undoubtedly be difficult and unpredictable. Unlike in past years, though, I hope this will not be a scripted debate where everyone basically knows the outcome in advance. We do not know exactly what is going to happen. We apparently are going to have the opportunity to offer and vote on amendments. We are going to legislate, not just make speeches for a couple of days and use parliamentary tactics to block reform. We are going to actually try to pass a bill. 
   I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to keep an open mind and remember that what we are doing here  will affect all Americans. Every one of our constituents, every citizen in this country, has an interest in the health of our democracy. We have a great responsibility here, and I hope we are up to it. 
   There are many things wrong with our current campaign financing system. I hope this body will grapple with that system in a comprehensive way at some point--sooner rather than later. 
   For me--and I do not speak for anyone else--I believe ultimately we should move to a system of public financing of elections to free candidates from the demands of fundraising and free the legislative process from the influence of special interests. 
   I favor giving candidates more access to the airwaves at reduced cost so they can get their messages out to the public without having to spend all this time raising money. I believe the groups that run ads that attack candidates within a month or even a few days of an election should have to report their contributors and their expenditures, just as a campaign 
   committee has to do. 
   This is the key point: It is clear that this Senate--I emphasize, this Senate--will not pass a comprehensive bill to deal with all or even most of the problems with the current system. We have known this for some time. In fact, the bill we considered in the last Congress was even significantly narrower than the comprehensive bill Senator MCCAIN and I first introduced in 1995. But during our 5-year effort, it has become more and more clear that soft money is the biggest loophole in this system and perhaps the most corrupting aspect of the system. 
   Soft money has exploded during those 5 years to the point where many Americans believe--and I share their belief--that the loophole has swallowed the election laws. In fact, the best statement I have heard on this was by the third cosponsor of the original McCain-Feingold bill, the Senator from Tennessee, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, FRED THOMPSON, who said plainly, without any legal jargon and all the other language we tend to use out here: Mr. President, we really don't have a campaign finance system anymore. That said it all. That captured the impact of soft money on our system. 
   So the bill that Senator MCCAIN and I have introduced and that we consider today essentially asks a very simple question: Will the Senate ban political party soft money or not? It is that simple. 
   This bill is a soft money ban, pure and simple. At this point it says nothing--nothing--about issue ads, nothing about disclosure or even enforcement. It does codify the Beck decision on union dues. It has minor changes with regard to certain aggregate limits on hard money contributions. But otherwise it leaves the status quo intact, except for one simple and crucial reform: This bill prohibits the political parties from accepting unlimited contributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals. 
   This is what it says to the political parties: Stop the charade. Forget about the loophole that has swallowed the law. Live under the law Congress passed in 1974. Raise your money primarily from individuals, not corporations or unions, in amounts of $20,000 per year or less. 
   It is soft money that brought us the scandals of 1996--the selling of access and influence in the White House and the Congress, the use of the Lincoln Bedroom and Air Force One to reward contributors, the White House coffees. All of this came from soft money because, without soft money, the parties would not have been tempted to come up with ever more enticing offers to get the big contributors to open their checkbooks. It just would not be worth it to do all of that under the hard money limits. It is only the unlimited opportunity for the unlimited check that creates that kind of a temptation. 
   But today, both parties aggressively engage in this big money auction. It is an arms race where the losers are the American people. Soft money causes Americans, time and time again, to question the integrity and impartiality of the legislative process. Everything we do is under scrutiny and subject to suspicion because major industries and labor organizations are giving our political parties such big piles of money. Whether it is the telecommunications legislation, Y2K liability, the bankruptcy bill, defense spending, or health care, someone out there is telling the public, often with justification, in my view, that the Congress cannot be trusted to do what is best for the public interest because the major affected industries are giving us money while those bills are pending in committee or debated on the floor. 
    I have tried, over the past few months, to highlight the influence of money on the legislative process through the calling of the bankroll. Time and time again, I have found that increasingly, the really big money, the money that many believe now has the biggest influence here, is soft money. 
   We have to clean our campaign finance house, and the best way to start is to get rid of soft money. Let us make rules that protect the people again in this country. With soft money, there are essentially no rules and no limits. With this bill, we can begin to restore some sanity to our campaign finance system. 
   To be candid--I don't like to admit it--when I came to the Senate, I wasn't even sure what soft money was, or at least I didn't know everything that could be done with it. After a tough race in 1992 against a well-financed incumbent opponent who spent twice as much as I did, I was mostly concerned with the difficulties of people who are not wealthy in running for office. My commitment to campaign finance reform was honestly forged from that experience. 
   But something has happened since I got here. Soft money has exploded, with far-reaching consequences for our elections and the functioning of Congress. I truly believe--and I didn't necessarily feel this way 3 or 4 years ago--if we can do nothing else on campaign finance reform in this Congress, we must stop the cancerous growth of soft money before it consumes us and ultimately the remaining credibility of our system. 
   I want to take a few minutes to describe to my colleagues in concrete terms, instead of talking about large sums of money in general, the growth of soft money over the past 6 years, all since I first came to the Senate not so long ago. It is a frightening story. I hope my colleagues, staff, and people watching will listen to these numbers because they are staggering. 
   As this chart shows, soft money first arrived on the scene of our national elections in the 1980 election, after a 1978 FEC ruling opened the door for parties to accept contributions from corporations and unions that are barred from contributing to Federal elections. The best available estimate is that parties raised, in that 1980 cycle, that first cycle, under $20 million in soft money. By the 1992 election, the year I was elected to this body, soft money fundraising by the parties had gone from under $20 million to $86 million. 
   Obviously, $86 million already was a lot of money. It was nearly as much as the $110 million the two Presidential candidates were given in 1992 in public financing from the U.S. Treasury. There was already real concern about how that money was spent. Despite the FEC decision that soft money could be used for activities such as get-out-the-vote and voter registration campaigns without violating the Federal election law's prohibition on corporate and union contributions in connection with Federal elections, the parties sent much of their soft money to be spent in States where the Presidential election between George Bush and Bill Clinton was close or where there were key contested Senate races, not necessarily connected to the purposes for which that money was supposedly allowed to be used. 
   Still, soft money, in 1992, was far from the central issue in our debate over campaign finance reform in 1993 and 1994. Then in 1995, when Senator MCCAIN and I first introduced the McCain-Feingold bill, our bill did include a ban on soft money, 
   but it wasn't even close to being the most controversial or important provision of our bill. As far as we knew, no one paid any attention to it. I have my own original summary of our first bill. It is numbered 9 out of 12 items. We mentioned all other kinds of things first. It is just above ``ban on personal use of campaign funds,'' which was already essentially required by the FEC anyway. I am saying, I didn't realize, when I introduced this bill with Senator MCCAIN, what was about to happen.  
   Indeed, the Republican campaign finance bill introduced in the Senate in 1993, cosponsored by the Senator from Kentucky and many other opponents of reform on the Republican side, actually contained a ban on soft money. In 1993, they were very comfortable with the implications, constitutional issues and others, connected with stopping soft money. Apparently not today. 
   Then came the 1996 election and the enormous explosion of soft money fueled by the parties' decision to use the money on phony issue ads supporting their Presidential candidates. Remember those ads that everybody thought were Clinton and Dole ads but were really run by the parties? I remember seeing them for the first time in the Cloakroom. That was the moment when soft money began to achieve its full corrupting potential on the national scene. 
   As you can see on this chart, again, total soft money fundraising skyrocketed as a result. Three times as much soft money was raised in 1996 as in 1992. Let me say that again. Soft money tripled in one Presidential election cycle. What was the effect of this explosion of soft money, other than millions of dollars available for ads supporting Presidential candidates who had agreed to run their campaign on equal and limited grants from Federal taxpayers? The total dollars raised, as shown on this chart, don't tell the whole story. This talks about the total amounts. This talks about the campaign side of this problem of soft money. There is a whole other story, and that is the impact of these contributions on what we do here. 
   Soft money is raised primarily from corporate interests that have a legislative ax to grind. So the explosion of soft money brought another explosion--an explosion of influence and access in this Congress and in this administration. Consider these statistics on this chart. I hope people will note these figures. They amaze me. As long as I have been involved with this issue, they have amazed me. 
   In 1992, there were a total of 52 donors who gave over a total of $200,000 to political parties. In 1996, just 4 years later, 219 donors gave that much soft money. Over 20 donors gave over $300,000 in soft money contributions during the 1992 cycle. But in 1996, 120 donors gave contributions totaling $300,000 or more. What about over 400,000? In 1992, 13 donors gave that much soft money. But in 1996, it was all the way up to 79 donors giving $400,000 per person or interest. Whereas only 9 donors in 1992 gave $500,000--a half million dollars, Mr. President; people giving a half million dollars--by 1996, 50 donors gave a half million dollars. 
   Does anyone think those donors expect nothing for this act of generosity? Does anyone think those donors get nothing for their generosity? Does anyone think the principle of one person/one vote means anything to anyone anymore if somebody can give a half million dollars? 
   Here is another amazing statistic: This is even worse, to me. In 1992, only 7 companies gave over $150,000 to each of the political parties--double givers, we call them, who made contributions to both parties. In 1996, the number of these double givers was up to 43: Forty-three companies or associations gave $150,000 or more to both the Democrat and the Republican Party. I would suggest there is no ideological motive. This is not about their passion for good government. These donors are playing both sides of the fence. They don't care about who is in power. They want to get their hooks into whoever is controlling the legislative agenda. 
   Here are some of the companies in this rather exclusive group. We know they have a big interest in what Congress does: Philip Morris, Joseph Seagram & Sons, RJR Nabisco, Walt Disney, Atlantic Richfield, AT&T, Federal Express, MCI, the Association of Trial Lawyers, the National Education Association, Lazard Freres & Co., Anheuser Busch, Eli Lilly, Time Warner, Chevron Corp., Archer Daniel's Midland, NYNEX, Textron Inc., Northwest Airlines. Mr. President, it is a who's who of corporate America. These are the big investors in the U.S. Congress, and no one can convince the American people that these companies get no return on their investment. So we have an ever-increasing number of companies that are participating in this system, trying to make sure their interests are protected and their lobbyists' calls returned. 
   There is another effect of this explosion of soft money, and that is the increasing participation of Members of this body in raising it. 
   I do not know how many of my colleagues are actually picking up the phones across the street in our party committee headquarters to ask corporate CEOs for soft money contributions. But no one here can deny that our parties are asking us to do this. It is now simply expected that United States Senators will be soft money fundraisers. 
   Consider the soft money raised in recent off-year elections. In 1994, the parties raised a total of $101.7 million dollars. Only about $18.5 million of that amount was raised by the congressional and senatorial campaign committees. In 1998, the most recent election, soft money fundraising more than doubled to $224.4 million. And $107 million of that total was raised by the congressional and senatorial campaign committees. That's nearly half of the total soft money raised by the parties. 
   Half the soft money that the parties raised in the last election went to the several party campaign committees for members of Congress, as opposed to the national party committees. 
   When you hear all this talk about how the parties need this money generally, that is why they need soft money, and an awful of lot is not going to the parties generally. And I and many of my colleagues know from painful experience that much of that money ended up being spent on phony issue ads in Senate races. The direct contribution of corporate money to federal candidates has been banned in federal elections since 1907, but that money is now being raised by Senators as soft money and spent to try to influence the election of Senators. It is spent to try to influence the election of Senators. To me, this is a complete obliteration of the spirit of the law. It is wrong. It must be stopped. 
   The growth of soft money has made a mockery of our campaign finance laws. It has turned Senators into panhandlers for huge contributions from corporate patrons. And it has multiplied the number of corporate interests that have a claim on the attention of members and the work of this institution. 
   Mr. President, there is broad and bipartisan support for banning soft money. Former Presidents Bush, Carter, and Ford believe that soft money must be eliminated, as does a large and distinguished bipartisan group of former Members of Congress, organized last year by former Senator and Vice President Walter Mondale, a Democrat, and former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, a Republican. Their effort has been joined at last count by 216 former members of the House and Senate. Senators Mondale and Kassebaum published an opinion piece in the Washington Post that eloquently spells out the rationale and the critical need to enact this reform. 
   They state that a ban on soft money would ``restore a sound principle long held to be essential. That bedrock principle, developed step by step through measures signed into law by presidents from Theodore Roosevelt to Gerald Ford, is that federal elections campaigns should be financed by limited contributions from individuals and not by either corporate or union treasuries. Neither candidates for federal office, nor the national political party committees whose primary mission is to elect them, should be dependent on the treasuries of corporations or unions that have strong economic interests in the decisions of the federal government.''

   Mr. FEINGOLD. As I mentioned, Mr. President, Senators Mondale and Kassebaum Baker put together a group of former members 216 strong who want to end soft money. One of those is former Senator Bill Brock, who also served as Chairman of the Republican Party. In an op-ed 
   last year, Senator Brock dispelled the myth that the parties cannot survive without soft money. He stated: ``In truth, the parties were stronger and closer to their  roots before the advent of this loophole than they are today.'' He adds: ``Far from reinvigorating the parties themselves, soft money has simply strengthened certain specific candidates and the few donors who can make huge contributions while distracting parties from traditional grassroots work.'' 
   Those are not just my sentiments; they are the sentiments of former Senator Brock, and he has it exactly right. 
   Our national political parties should be the engines of democracy, the organizers of individual donors and volunteers who care about big ideas and are willing to work for them. Instead they have become fundraising behemoths, obsessed with extorting the biggest chunks of cash that they can from corporate and wealthy donors. This is not what the two great political parties should be about Mr. President. Soft money has changed our politics for the worse Mr. President. And I think everyone in this body knows that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the bill the Senate is now considering accomplishes a ban on soft money in four simple ways. First, and most important, it prohibits the national political parties from raising or spending money that is not subject to the limits of the federal election laws. Second, it prohibits federal officeholders and candidates from raising money that is not subject to the election laws, except for appearing as a speaker at a fundraising event sponsored by a state or local political party. Third, to prevent soft money from being laundered through state parties and making its way back into federal elections, it requires state and local parties that spend money on certain federal election activities to use only money that is subject to the federal election laws. And finally, it prohibits the parties from soliciting money for or contributing money to outside organizations. 
   The amendment also makes some changes in the contribution limits of current law in a recognition of the new difficulties that parties may face as they are forced to go ``cold turkey'' in giving up soft money. It increases the amount that individuals can legally give to state party committees from $5,000 per year to $10,000 per year. And it increases the amount that an individual can give to all parties, PACs, and candidates combined in a year from $25,000 to $30,000. 
   This provision is tough, but it is fair. It allows federal candidates to continue to help raise money for their state parties by appearing at fundraisers. It permits the state parties until four months before an election to use non-federal money to conduct voter registration drives that will obviously benefit federal candidates as well. 
   Mr. President, I truly believe that we must do much more than ban soft money to fix our campaign finance system. But if there is one thing more than any other that must be done now it is to ban soft money. Otherwise the soft money loophole will completely obliterate the Presidential public funding system, and lead to scandals that will make what we saw in 1996 seem quaint. And the number of investors in this body will continue to skyrocket, with untold consequences on the work of this body and the confidence of the American people in their government. 
   Mr. President, we have some momentum. I was delighted this week to have us get another cosponsor on this bill, the Senator from Kansas, SAM BROWNBACK, and to also have the endorsement of one of the leaders from the other body, Congressman ASA HUTCHINSON. So we have had good momentum this week. I am pleased with that. I especially felt the momentum when last Friday I had a chance to go to Nashville, Tennessee, and I had the good fortune to meet an extraordinary woman, who is in Washington today. I'm speaking of Doris Haddock, from Dublin, New Hampshire. Doris has become known to many people throughout the country and around the world as ``Granny D.'' 
   She is 89 years old. On January 1st of this year, she set out to walk across this country to call attention to the need for campaign finance reform and call on this body to pass the McCain-Feingold bill. As she said last week, voting for McCain-Feingold is something our mothers and grandmothers would want us to do. And coming from Granny D, this is not just a polite request--it is a challenge and a demand from one of the toughest and bravest advocates of reform I have ever had the pleasure to know. 
   I joined Granny D on the road last week, and as we walked together through the streets of Nashville, shouts of ``Go Granny Go'' came from every corner--from drivers in their cars, pedestrians on the sidewalk and construction workers on the job. 
   The response she got that day, and the support she gets every day on her walk across America, speak volumes about where the American people stand on this issue. They are fed up with a campaign finance system so clogged with cash that it has essentially ceased to function; they are frustrated by a Congress that has stood by and watched our democracy deteriorate; and today they are demanding that the U.S. Senate join Granny D on the road to reform by passing the McCain-Feingold bill. 
   Granny D and countless Americans like her are demanding, here and now, that this body act to ban soft money and begin to clean up our campaign finance mess. Granny has been walking across this country for more than nine months now--from California to Tennessee, in the sweltering heat and now in the growing cold, over mountains and across a desert. At age 89, she has braved all of this. And all she is asking U.S. Senators to do in return one simple thing. 
   What she's asking is not anywhere near as strenuous, and it won't take anywhere near as much time as what she has endured. 
   All she is asking the members of this body to do is lift their arm to cast one vote--a vote to ban soft money. 
   That's what she's asking, and I urge my colleagues not let her down. The time has past for the excuses, equivocations and evasions that members of this body have employed time and again to avoid passing campaign finance reform legislation. The time has come to put partisanship aside, to put our own ideal reform bills aside and finally put our democracy first--let's join Granny D on the road to reform. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his question. I certainly do agree with it. I appreciate the way he said it. 
   I think we all agreed early on we would easily accept an amendment such as this. I want to make a couple of comments before we go forward with it. 
   I think a serious omission has been made in this conversation about what the standard is with regard to corruption. The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo did not just speak of corruption, which is the standard the Senator from Kentucky insists on. It also clearly refers to the appearance of corruption. So any suggestion that we have to demonstrate in this case or that case that there is actual corruption flies directly in the face of what the law of the land is under Buckley v. Valeo. So there is not a problem with the amendment itself. I question how much it has to do with the debate before us. I think it is irrelevant unless the Senator from Kentucky 
   believes we do not have bribery laws, but I don't see any problem with it.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I will in a moment. I want to make a few comments because it was very difficult to get the floor, given the method of recognition used this morning. 
   But the irony of this amendment, even though it certainly is acceptable, is that the corruption that is so evident is evident as a moral matter; it is a matter of governance. It is not recognized by the current law--except perhaps in cases I don't know about--as  actual legal violation or a crime. The corruption our bill seeks to ban now is perfectly legal. That is the point. It is perfectly legal and it would not be reached as a legal matter by this amendment. This amendment would not reach the kind of soft money contribution we are talking about. 
   The Senator from Kentucky knows this very well and almost revels in the loophole that would swallow the law. It is very important to recognize because I hope someday this gets before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
   The Senator from New York said: Well, we already have a record of at least the appearance of corruption as provided by the Senator from Utah. 
   Remember, our bill doesn't just affect congressional soft money; it also affects money used in Presidential elections, and thanks to the Senator from Utah, we now have on the record for the Justices to examine, his conclusion--which I believe is a fair statement--that you at least believe there was an appearance of corruption with regard to the Mr. Tamraz situation and the Indian tribe situation. 
   I have to tell you, when I saw the TV show about the contributions with regard to the Indian tribe, it was one of the saddest things I have ever seen. Just as a citizen of this country, not as a Senator, if that didn't have the appearance of corruption, I don't know what would. 
   To suggest there is a connection between soft money and an appearance of corruption is very legitimate, and I thank the Senator from Utah for putting on the record three examples of what I think easily qualify as appearances of corruption. Certainly, the American people regard it as the appearance of corruption. That is the standard. The standard is not what the Senator from Kentucky is trying to make the standard, that we have to walk in here with documented corruption that is tantamount to bribery. There are laws on the books for that. The whole point is these practices are perfectly legal and nobody should be in trouble under the law for doing something that is perfectly legal. 
   Let me read from Buckley v. Valeo because this is the central confusion on this whole debate this morning, that somehow the standard is that Senator MCCAIN or I or somebody else has to walk in here with evidence of corruption. In fact, it would probably be a violation of rule XIX of the Senate if we did. But that is not even our point. It doesn't have to do with individual Members of the Senate; certainly not anything I have tried to do. Let me read from what the Court said. The Court specifically pointed out that you don't have to prove bribery in order to have a justification for some kind of limits on campaign contributions. The Court said:  
   Laws making criminal the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence governmental action. And while disclosure requirements serve the many salutary purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure and that contribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or the appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions are fully disclosed.  
   This is where the Senator from Kentucky is not properly stating what the Court asked for. The Court does not say it must be only the reality of corruption. The Court says it may be the appearance of corruption, and that is often going to be in the eyes of the beholder. And Senators can disagree about what is the appearance of corruption and can amass evidence for the record of what may be the appearance of corruption, and that is what I have done by my calling of the bankroll and nobody objected for 14 times when I pointed out what appears to be a corrupting influence of multihundred-thousand-dollar contributions. It is not only the appearance of corruption, but that this is inherent, according to the Supreme Court, it is of the nature of large contributions. So this bar that the opponents of reform raise for us, that somehow we have to come in here with a pile of evidence of what everybody knows is true; that is, that soft money has a very inappropriate influence on our legislative process--I 
   reiterate, not an illegal influence. That is why we need a law. That is why we are here. We need to make these kinds of unlimited contributions clearly illegal once again. 
   Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with accepting the amendment, having had the opportunity to express my view that this debate, thus far, was not directly related to the issue of soft money. But I will be happy to yield for a question from the Senator from Utah.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I do not think it is possible for anyone to determine for everyone else what an appearance of corruption is. It is our responsibility as a legislative body to look at the total record of what is going on in our campaign finance system and to determine whether the American people believe the various things we do have an appearance of corruption and whether there is a remedy for it. 
   I do not think it has anything to do with any particular part of the process. I think any part of the process can be perfectly clean at any point, but if there is an abuse at some point, a very large contribution at the wrong time, it is not about whether technically it is legal. It is about whether a large body of the American people would consider--for example, a $200,000 contribution given 2 days after the House marked up a bankruptcy bill by MBNA. OK, it is not illegal. Conceded. Maybe it is not even corrupt, but it certainly has an appearance of corruption to me and I think to many people. That would be a concrete example of where the appearance of corruption may occur.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. As I said earlier, it is perfectly possible on an occasion that the kind of procedure the Senator has talked about could give rise to an  appearance of corruption. It is not something one can sort of determine by a series of court rulings. The question is, Do we as legislators find that our constituents see that sort of thing as appearing corrupt and, therefore, do we legislate a response to it? That is the standard for legislatures, not the standard for the court which is trying to convict someone of a crime.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I simply cannot say for the general public on that particular example how they would react. That is not my role. My job as a representative is to react to what people respond to when you point out various things that have been done. I do not know what the response would be to the particular incident. 
   Some people might, obviously, as you say, think you were successful in doing something for your constituents. I know from my own experience as a Senator that you have to be very careful about the appearance as you move forward with something, not for purposes of our debate but for purposes of how it might look to your constituents. So you look to your constituents and you look to your sense of what people are feeling about the system for an answer to your question. 
   In answer to your question, there is no automatic connection between every time a Senator does something for an interest and corruption--of course not--or the appearance of corruption. But the question is, How do the American people feel about the process? 
   What I am saying is, what this debate is about, because we got into the issue of soft money, is whether there is a level of contribution, whether the dollars get so high that the Supreme Court's language of it being inherently appearing corrupt comes into play. I suggest when you get into high numbers of contributions, you cannot avoid the appearance of corruption. You may avoid actual corruption, but you cannot avoid the appearance of corruption when we increasingly have the 
   reality of people giving $500,000 apiece.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly agree with the Senator's suggestion of how we are going to proceed. And to reiterate, when I started on the floor on May 20, 1999 and talked about various changes in the mining law that were prevented under the emergency supplemental appropriations conference report, as the Senate suggested, I was not talking about a particular contribution to any particular Member. It was a process with many factors. One of the factors was the $10.6 million the mining interests gave over a 6-year period. To me, that is of such a high level that it raises an appearance of corruption. 
   I think that is exactly what the Senator from Arizona is getting at, and exactly what he was trying to do in the case before us. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it has only been the first day of debate on this issue. I do note a marked shift in the strategy of our opponents. They are not talking so much about how the first amendment to the United States Constitution Bill of Rights would be violated by our version of the bill, the soft money prohibition. There have been a few comments, but this has not been the main thrust. 
   There is a good reason for it. That is because there is not a credible case that can be made that banning soft money contributions to the political parties is unconstitutional. I think it is useful at this time to lay out a few of the reasons why this is the case, so no one can be confused by the desperate attempt that has been made to label any attempt at campaign finance reform, regardless of what its provisions might be, as unconstitutional. It has become a mantra, a standard line, but it does not hold water regarding the bill before us. 
   The first proposition is very straightforward and that is that Congress can prohibit corporate and labor contributions. Congress prohibited the contributions by corporations in 1907 in the Tillman Act, and then in 1947 it prohibited the same kinds of contributions by unions under the Taft-Hartley Act. The courts have recognized that corporate treasury money can amount to an undue influence or an unfair advantage. That is why in a couple of key cases the courts have so ruled. 
   In Massachusetts, Citizen For Life v. FEC, 1984, for example, they stated:  
   Direct corporate spending on political activity raises the prospect that resources amassed in the economic marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the political marketplace. Political ``free trade'' does not necessarily require that all who participate in the political marketplace do so with exactly equal resources. 
   Relative availability of funds is after all a rough barometer of public support. The resources in the treasury of a business corporation, however, are not an indication of popular support for the corporation's political ideas. They reflect instead [the court said] the economically motivated decisions of investors and customers. The availability of these resources may make a corporation a formidable political presence, even though the power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of its ideas.  
   Then, after making that very clear with regard to the ability of restricting direct corporate contributions, the Austin case made it clear and affirmed this decision, saying:  
   We therefore have recognized that ``the compelling governmental interest in preventing corruption support[s] the restriction of the influence of political war chests funneled through the corporate form.''  
   It is clear law, indisputable law, that Congress can prohibit corporate and labor direct contributions to candidates or to the political parties. 
   Furthermore, so there is no confusion because there was a lot of talk today about somehow we have to demonstrate actual corruption in each instance before we can do something about it, that is not the law with regard to our ability to limit individual contributions. The Court has been clear that we can limit individual contributions either in the case of actual corruption, the reality of corruption, or the appearance of corruption. This is the system that was validated in the most significant ruling of many decades in the area of campaign finance reform, Buckley v. Valeo, 1974. Let me put some of the language in the RECORD from that decision that supports that. The court said:  
   By contrast with a limitation upon expenditures for political expression, a limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributors' ability to engage in free communication. A contribution serves as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views, but [the court said, that it] does not communicate the underlying basis for the support. The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated, symbolic act of contributing.  
   Later in the decision the court continued:  
   It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary purpose to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption regarding from large financial contributions--in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for the $1,000 contribution limitation.  
   The Court then said:  
   To the extent large contributions are given to security political quid pro quo's from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.  
   That had to do with the quid pro quos. And then the Court continued:  
   Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro quo arrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.  
   The Buckley case makes it clear you can limit the individual contributions. The Court said:  
   We find that, under the rigorous standard review established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests served by restricting the size of financial contributions to political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited effect upon First Amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 contribution ceiling.  
   So these are the court cases. If you do not believe my word on it alone, I suggest one take a look at the letter we have from 126 legal scholars, constitutional scholars around the country who say specifically that it is entirely constitutional to ban soft money given to the parties. 
   These scholars wrote as a group in a letter:  
   We believe that such restrictions are constitutional. The soft money loophole has raised the specter of corruption stemming from large contributions (and those from prohibited sources) that led Congress to enact the federal contribution limits in the first place. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that the government has a compelling interest in combating the appearance and reality of corruption, an interest that justifies restricting large campaign contributions in Federal elections. ..... Significantly, the Court upheld the $25,000 annual limit on an individual's total contributions in connection with federal elections.  
   And so on. 
   Mr. President, 126 constitutional scholars have backed up this almost obvious notion we can ban the soft money given to the political parties. 
   I might add, since the Senator from Kentucky is fond of quoting the ACLU as one of his allies on this issue, in fact, every living former president, executive director, and legal director of the ACLU all think that it is perfectly constitutional to ban soft money. 
   Finally, if you do not believe any of those folks, I hope you would believe the Senator from Washington, one of the strongest opponents of our bill. Senator GORTON, on this floor, in a candid moment, said:  
   In fact, with my own views on where the constitutional line is likely to be drawn, McCain-Feingold restrictions on money to political parties might well be upheld, probably would be upheld, at least in part. It is possible that they would be upheld in their entirety.  
   So even one of our most learned and effective opponents on this issue, Senator GORTON, has said on this floor that it is perfectly constitutional to ban soft money. That is why you are not hearing much about the constitutional problems in this bill, as you did last  year. I think some of those arguments weren't too strong, but they certainly were stronger. 
   This bill would pass constitutional muster quite easily. I believe there is no legitimate authority to contradict that. I believe it is important to have this in the RECORD. Perhaps this will be returned to later on, as an argument. I have noticed a strong diminution in the reliance on the constitutional argument. There are other arguments being made: That somehow this is a dagger to the heart of one party or another; the attempt to have Senator MCCAIN answer very specific questions about comments he made in his Presidential campaign. The opposition seems very diffused on this point on a number of issues, but the constitutional question is not being very effectively or seriously raised. 
   Mr. President, I suggest that is because there is no legitimate constitutional argument against what we are trying to do. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly want the Record to note I had no objection to the Senator from Kentucky speaking, as long as it did not come out of our time. In fact, I was happy to give additional time. 
   I want to make a comment or two about what he is talking about because he is launching, apparently, an attack on people who signed the letter, 127 constitutional scholars. Apparently there is a problem. One of the men who wrote an article about NAFTA--I do not know what it has to do with his ability to comment on this. 
   I am surprised to hear Senator MCCONNELL say some of this. Back when we presented this letter, he said he could easily come up with 127 scholars on his own who would say banning soft money is unconstitutional. He has not done that, and it has been a long time since that time, and I frankly doubt he ever will. 
   Anyone who knows anything about the law and the legal academy would agree that instead of picking individual people out of this list and attacking them personally, they would have to concede that many of the people on the list are very distinguished law professors. Professor Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern California Law Center, Professor Jack Balkin of Yale Law School, Professor Frank Michelman of Harvard Law School, and Professor Norman Dorsen of NYU Law School know something about the law. In fact, they know more than just about anybody in this body. 
   The executive director and the legal director of the ACLU says a ban on soft money is constitutional. Of course, the ultimate arbiter, the Supreme Court, said in the Buckley case that individual contributions can be limited and, in the Austin case, that corporate contributions can be prohibited. 
   If Senator MCCONNELL does not believe these authorities, he should, again, consult with the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, one of his strongest supporters on the floor in opposing reform, who has essentially conceded that banning party soft money would likely be found constitutional. 
   This notion that the Senator from Kentucky could easily come up with his list of constitutional scholars which we have never seen is a ploy that I, frankly, do not understand. Where is the list? Instead, he wants to pick apart one or two people on the list. I question that. These folks gave it their best shot and indicated what everybody concludes with any credibility on this subject, and that is that it is perfectly constitutional to ban soft money. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I certainly have no objection to the Senator from Kentucky laying down an amendment. Before he does that, I do make one comment on the colloquy I just listened to. 
   It is my understanding, based on the agreement we have with the majority leader--I just want to reiterate what Senator MCCAIN said--that this was to be a 5-day debate. The critical issue here is on what day the cloture motion can be filed. It is certainly my understanding, based on the discussion we just had, the cloture motion can't be filed until Monday, meaning the cloture vote couldn't occur before Wednesday. That is how I am going to proceed, and I assume that is the good faith understanding. 
   This agreement was not hammered out of pure good faith. This was based, as it should be in the Senate, on our willingness to withdraw an amendment from a piece of legislation at another critical time when the Senate's business was pressing. 
   I certainly intend to give an opening statement. This bill is not different from any other major piece of legislation. In fact, I argue it is one of the most important bills we can take up. It is important it be set out properly, and I certainly intend to make an opening statement tomorrow as well.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senate advice and consent to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. 
   As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have advocated for consideration of this treaty since President Clinton submitted it to this body for advice and consent on September 22, 1997. Now, more than 2 years later, this important treaty is being considered on the Senate floor. While I am pleased that we are having this debate, I am concerned about the manner in which we reached this point. I regret that the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, had only one day of hearings on this important arms control agreement and that the committee did not consider and mark up a resolution of ratification. 
   I am concerned that this debate is too limited in duration and scope. This is obviously serious business. And I hope that the manner in which this treaty was brought to the floor does not doom it to failure. This treaty should be fully debated on its merits. And this body should have the opportunity to offer any statements, declarations, understandings, or conditions that we deem necessary. But this treaty should not be defeated simply because the Senate has backed itself into a corner in which the choice is to vote up or down now without the option to postpone this important vote in favor of further consideration. Some of our colleagues have expressed their desire for further consideration. But they have said that if they are forced to vote today, they will oppose this treaty--not necessarily because they do not support the treaty, but rather because they feel they cannot yet fully support it without further study. 
   I think putting Senators in this position is an irresponsible course of action. 
   As my colleagues know, I support this treaty. And I will vote in favor of it today should it come to that. But I hope we will consider the consequences of defeating this treaty, not on its merits, but because of the political box in  which we find ourselves. This treaty must not fall victim to politics. The consequences of its defeat will be felt from Moscow to New Delhi to Beijing to Baghdad. And this body, the greatest deliberative body in the world, would be sending the message that we did not want to spend more time on one of the most important issues facing the world today. 
   We do live in dangerous times, Mr. President. Weapons capable of mass destruction have replaced more conventional weapons in our world. New threats continue to emerge. But we have the power to stem the tide of nuclear proliferation. Perhaps we cannot stop it completely. But we can make sure that the nuclear arms race is stopped in its tracks and we can make it extremely difficult for those with nuclear aspirations to develop a weapon in which they can have high confidence. 
   And we should do everything in our power to make the world safer for future generations. And if that includes delaying the vote on this treaty, then we should swallow our political pride and do that. 
   As a number of my colleagues have already said, both in committee and on this floor, the idea of a nuclear test ban dates back to the Eisenhower administration. For more than 40 years, Presidents of both parties have advocated for such a treaty. 
   In a speech delivered on June 10, 1963, President John F. Kennedy discussed his support for the negotiation of a comprehensive test ban treaty. He said--and I quote:  
   The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.  
   Mr. President, those words are as relevant today as they were when President Kennedy spoke them 36 years ago. Nuclear weapons are still one of the greatest hazards on the planet. And they have been joined by chemical, biological, and other weapons of mass destruction. President Kennedy spoke from the perspective of the cold war and the still escalating arms race with the Soviet Union. Now, in 1999, the cold war is over and the Soviet Union is no more. But we are on the brink of another nuclear arms race, this time in south Asia. India and Pakistan are watching, Mr. President. And we have the opportunity to end their nuclear aspirations once and for all. Or to give them the cover they need to continue testing. 
   We have the opportunity today at long last to become a party to a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty that will both stop the nuclear arms race in its tracks and maintain our option to withdraw from its provisions if our national security is threatened. 
   I hope that will be our paramount consideration in the coming hours as we decide whether to put this treaty up for a vote today or tomorrow. 
   Mr. President, as many of my colleagues have noted throughout this debate, there are many reasons why the United States should become a party to this important treaty. I will address three of them here. 
   First, this treaty will allow the United States to maintain our strong nuclear deterrent. This treaty does not require the parties to dismantle their existing nuclear stockpiles. It does not prevent them from maintaining those stockpiles through scientific means. Rather, this treaty prohibits further nuclear testing. The United States has not conducted any nuclear tests for 7 years, and the administration has testified that we have no intention of performing any further tests. The Departments of Defense and Energy already have a substantial database of information on the more than 1,000 nuclear tests that we have already performed. And this information has been the basis for the development of the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which the high-ranking administration officials have testified is an effective mechanism for maintaining the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. 
   Second, this treaty will help to create a worldwide nuclear status quo. Parties to the CTBT will be unable to conduct nuclear explosive tests to improve their existing weapons or develop stronger ones. This means that the nuclear arms race will be literally frozen where it is. This is beneficial to the United States for several reasons. It will allow us to maintain our nuclear superiority. It will protect us from the threat of stronger weapons in the future. And, in fact, it ensures that we will have the dubious distinction of having won the nuclear arms race. 
   The third point in favor of this treaty I will make is this: the CTBT is effectively verifiable. Some have argued that this treaty is not verifiable. It seems that argument echoes in these halls every time we debate an arms control treaty. But, again, that argument rings hollow. Verification is a tricky thing. All treaties, including arms control treaties, are largely based on good faith among the parties to them. Good faith in the sense that the parties who have ratified the treaty have promised to comply with the treaty's provisions. Collectively, the parties have agreed to a set of provisions, in the case of the CTBT to not perform nuclear tests. Alone, a country can decide to no longer perform nuclear tests--as the United States has already done--but no other nation knows for sure if that country is living up to its promise. 
   Under a multilateral treaty such as the CTBT, all parties have agreed to the provisions and are subject to a verification regime that otherwise would not exist. The CTBT says that if one party to the treaty has evidence that a test has occurred, that party can request an onsite inspection. This inspection will occur if 30 of the 51 members of the CTBT's Executive Council agree that the evidence warrants such an inspection. This type of onsite inspection cannot occur outside the CTBT regime, Mr. President. And this inspection will allow the parties to the treaty to obtain information that cannot be obtained outside the treaty regime. 
   No one here will claim that any treaty is 100 percent verifiable or that some countries may try to cheat. But the Pentagon has said that this treaty is effectively verifiable. And that is the key. The International Monitoring System created by this treaty includes 230 data gathering stations around the world in addition to those already operating in the United States. Last week, Secretary of Defense William Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``the information collected by these sensor stations would not normally be available to the U.S. intelligence community.'' In addition to this enhanced capability, the United States is also permitted, under the provisions of the treaty and in accordance with international law, to use our own national technical means to detect nuclear tests. 
   Mr. President, some people say that, because the United States has already made the decision not to do any further nuclear testing--and indeed that we have not tested in seven years--that this treaty is unnecessary. They claim that the CTBT merely reinforces what we have already done and that there is no real benefit to our ratification. In fact, as many of my colleagues have already addressed during this debate, and as I have already noted, there are many benefits to this treaty. We retain our leadership in the arms control arena. We maintain our nuclear superiority. And, importantly, we gain the ability to request and participate in onsite inspections of suspected nuclear testing abroad. And, if the President is unable to certify that our nuclear arsenal is sound, we have the option to withdraw from the treaty. 
   Mr. President, in urging my colleagues to support this important treaty, I will again quote President Kennedy:  
   The United States, as the world knows, will never start a war. We do not want a war. We do not now expect a war. This generation of Americans has already had enough--more than enough--of war and hate and oppression. We shall be prepared if others wish it. We shall be alert to try to stop it. But we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just. We are not helpless before that task or hopeless of its success. Confident and unafraid, we labor on--not toward a strategy of nuclear annihilation but toward a strategy of peace.  
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak about some grave concerns I have regarding the dramatic and unprecedented cuts to Title XX, the Social Services Block Grant, in S. 1650, the Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations bill. 
   As I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, the Social Services Block Grant is currently authorized at $2.38 billion, but the Senate bill provides for only $1.05 billion, a reduction of more than 50%, for Fiscal Year 2000. In addition, it appears that the bill would also accelerate the reduction in transferability of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families--or TANF--from 10% to 4.25%. In other words, not only has the appropriation been slashed in half, the ability of the states and counties to transfer other dollars into SSBG is also sharply reduced. 
   My immediate reaction when I learned about these cuts to SSBG was enormous disappointment. When I travel through each of Wisconsin's 72 counties each year holding town-meeting style listening sessions, many of my constituents have discussed with me the value and importance of SSBG funds in enabling the provision of vitally-needed services for some of our most vulnerable citizens. I have the benefit of a very engaged and active Counties Association to keep me informed about the importance of assuring SSBG funding. 
   But perhaps not all of my colleagues share my good fortune in this respect, perhaps some of our colleagues are not aware of the value of SSBG funds in their own states and communities--that is the only reason I can think of why these cuts are included in the bill. In the event that that is the case, please allow me a few moments to elaborate on the important services that SSBG dollars fund in my home state of Wisconsin: 
   Wisconsin counties received more than $42 million in SSBG dollars in FY 1997, the most recent year for which data is available. Those dollars provided services to Wisconsin's Seniors such as home meal delivery programs like meals-on-wheels, day programs for seniors, and supportive home care. SSBG dollars also help to provide crucial services to protect children, such as investigating potential child abuse cases and providing protective services for children who ARE being abused, and providing for after school programs so that children have a safe place to go in the afternoon. Throughout Wisconsin, SSBG dollars have enabled Wisconsin's counties to provide these services to 283,964 Wisconsinites--many of whom will lose access to these services if SSBG is further cut. 
   Lastly, let me illustrate what the impact of SSBG cuts means for some communities in Wisconsin: the Rainbow Center for Prevention of Child Abuse in Dane County, Wisconsin, will have to cut services for 130 families. In Milwaukee County, 428 patients will not receive outpatient mental health care, and 550 adults seeking drug and alcohol abuse treatment will be turned away. Milwaukee County will also lose funding for more than 2,000 shelter nights for the homeless and victims of domestic violence. 
   Mr. President, I hope that this short description of the many ways SSBG supports and strengthens counties and local communities helps to illustrate why a 50% reduction in funds will be so devastating. I hope that House and Senate conferees will restore SSBG to its authorized amount for Fiscal Year 2000 so that the counties who so rely on these funds will be able to provide the services our constituents need, services that are vital to supporting and strengthening our communities. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for S. 1678, the Medicare Beneficiaries Access to Care Act of 1999, a bill to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries across our nation continue to have access to the health care services that they need. The package that has been introduced addresses some of the most troubling areas in implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and I commend the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator DASCHLE, for the hard work that he and his staff put into the creation of this bill. 
   I joined my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, with the expectation that we would save $100 billion that would help preserve the solvency of the Medicare program. Yet the magnitude of cuts in BBA of 1997 have been much deeper than anyone intended. Present projections indicate that actual reductions have been in the area of $200 billion, twice as much as originally anticipated. 
   The unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have been severe indeed. And while there is a lot of publicity about the impact of BBA 1997 cuts on entities like hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies, the real issue here is that the cuts are threatening the ability of our constituents--patients who rely on these entities to provide care, rehabilitation, and life-saving services--to gain access to the care they need. 
   Take for example the impact of the BBA 1997 Interim Payment System for home health agencies in Medicare. IPS was designed as a way to counteract fraud, waste and abuse within the Medicare program. Unfortunately, the way in which IPS was implemented created a counterintuitive and unfair system that penalizes low-cost areas for their thrift by basing reimbursement on past spending. More than 40 home health agencies in 22 counties have closed in Wisconsin since the implementation of Medicare home health IPS. IPS has ratcheted Medicare home health payments so low that Wisconsin home health agencies are losing hundreds of dollars per patient per day treating Medicare patients. Agencies in Wisconsin are not closing just because the business isn't profitable, they are closing to reduce the devastating rate of loss. 
   BBA 1997 cuts have also been devastating for our nursing homes and patients' ability to gain access to outpatient therapy services. Reimbursements to some nursing homes in Wisconsin has been so low that one nursing home administrator in La Crosse, Wisconsin, informed me that his agency, one of the few Medicare-certified ventilator-dependent programs in the region, was losing between $150 and $300 per patient per day treating patients who depend on ventilators to breathe. That agency had no choice but to stop new admissions of ventilator-dependent patients. Similarly, residents of nursing homes who require physical therapy, occupational therapy or speech pathology services are faced with an arbitrary $1500 cap on their services, an amount that is grossly inadequate to provide the necessary rehabilitation to patients recovering from a stroke, an amputation or other life-altering event. These arbitrary caps on the provision of rehabilitative therapy, have the effect--though inadvertently--of placing a cap on the extent to which these patients can regain their independence. 
   One final area that I would like to raise is the expected impact on hospitals of BBA 1997 changes such as cuts to Graduate Medical Education payments and the impact of a Prospective Payment System on hospital outpatient departments. Preliminary estimates from my constituents at the Wisconsin Health and Hospital Association, WHA, indicate that Wisconsin's 28 teaching hospitals will lose almost $25 million per year from GME cuts. In addition, WHA projects that Wisconsin hospitals will lose $30 million over the next three years if PPS is implemented--a loss of such magnitude that several rural hospitals in Wisconsin would likely be forced to close.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on September 24 I introduced a new Africa trade bill--S..1636, the HOPE for Africa Act--a bill that will invigorate commercial relationships between the United States and African trading partners, with healthy results for both. 
   It expands trade between Africa and the United States, offers United States companies new opportunities to invest in African economies, and promises new HOPE for the people of Sub-Saharan Africa themselves, who are struggling against daunting odds to gain a foothold in the global marketplace and embrace the growth and stability it will bring. 
   It's important to say here that everyone proposing Africa trade legislation has the same goal--we all want to help expand trade and development with Africa in a way that is also good for American companies and workers--but it's equally important to point out how we differ in approach, and what those differences will mean for African economies. 
   For years Africa has gotten short shrift in the attention of the American public and of American policymakers, and I am very encouraged that there has been renewed interest in expanding opportunities for United States business in Africa. 
   But Congress shouldn't make up for those years of neglect by passing weak legislation that will have little impact on United States-Africa trade. 
   As a member of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa for more than 6 years, and its ranking Democrat for more than four, I know that now is the time for foresight and bold action, because Africa today is brimming with both tribulations and potential. 
   I offer this bill today because unfortunately, other proposals fall short of their goals by providing only minimal benefits for Africa and for Africans. 
   First and foremost, they fail to address two crises that are hobbling Africa's ability to compete--the overwhelming debt burden, and the deadly HIV/AIDS epidemic, both of which are so corrosive to African aspirations. 
   My legislation, which is similar in many respects to the HOPE for Africa bill introduced recently by Representative JESSE JACKSON, Jr., in the House of Representatives, takes a more comprehensive approach to our current trade relationship with Africa--the only kind of approach that can generate the kind of dramatic progress Africa needs to become a more viable partner in the global economy. 
   My HOPE for Africa legislation offers broader trading benefits than the other pending proposals, and just as importantly, it takes steps to address the debt burden and AIDS crisis that handicap African economies. 
   My bill extends trade benefits to selected African countries on a broader variety of products--and does not rely narrowly on textiles, as other proposals do. Broader benefits give African businesses and workers a better chance to establish sustainable trade-generated economic development. 
   My bill includes strong protections against the backdoor tactic of illegal transshipment of goods from China and other third countries through Africa to the United States, that would cheat workers and companies here and in Africa of hard-earned opportunities. 
   Provisions of my bill will help deter the influx to the African continent of lower-wage workers from outside Africa, ensuring that Africans themselves will be the ones to benefit from the provisions of this bill. 
   Another centerpiece of this bill is that it requires strict compliance with internationally-recognized standards of worker and human rights and environmental protections. The rights of Africa's peoples and the state of its environment may seem removed from life here in the United States. But if we are wise we will all remember that we are all affected when logging and mining deplete African rainforests and increase global warming, and we all reap the benefits of an Africa where freedom and human dignity reign on the continent, creating a stable environment in which business can thrive. American ideals and simple good sense require that we be vigilant in this regard. 
   The bill takes crucial steps to support the fight against the crushing HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has had a devastating impact in Sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 33.4 million adults and children living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 1998, a staggering 22.5 million live in the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Since the onset of the worldwide HIV/AIDS crisis, more than 34 million sub-Saharan Africans have been infected, and more than 11.5 million of those infected have died. Since the onset of the HIV/AIDS crisis, approximately 83 percent of AIDS deaths have occurred in Africa. The vast tragedy of HIV/AIDS in Africa is daunting, overwhelming, but it must be overwhelmed with a massive effort that will have to be integrated with any Africa trade regime that hopes to succeed. 
   Finally, the bill provides for substantial debt relief for Sub-Saharan African nations. Debt, debt, debt is the finger on the scales that keeps that rich continent from achieving its economic potential and embracing a freer, more prosperous future. In 1997, sub-Saharan African debt totaled more than $215 billion, about $6.5 billion of which is owed to the United States government. The debt of at least 30 of the 48 Sub-Saharan African countries exceeds 50 percent of their gross national products. The international community must find a reasonable way substantially to reduce this debt burden so that the countries of sub-Saharan Africa can invest scarce dollars in the futures of the most precious of their natural resources--their people. 
   My HOPE for Africa bill can establish a framework to achieve these goals by relieving Sub-Saharan African nations of a significant piece of their current debt, supporting environmental protections and human rights in these developing economies, and giving African businesses--including small and women-owned businesses--a chance to share in the burgeoning global economy. 
   I was pleased to announce my intention to offer this legislation at a press conference recently in Milwaukee along with several representatives of the state legislature and the local business community. 
   Mr. President, the current level of trade and investment between the United States and African countries is depressingly small. 
   It is called the magic 1 percent. Africa represents only 1 percent of our exports, one percent of our imports, and 1 percent of our foreign direct investment. 
   That is a tragic 1 percent, the fruit of missed opportunities, wasted potential and simple neglect. 
   The history of U.S. trade on the African continent is a litany of lost opportunity with a smattering of bright spots concentrated among a few countries. 
   United States trade in Africa is not diversified. In 1998, 78 percent of U.S. exports to the region went to only five countries--South Africa, Nigeria, Anglola, Ghana, and Kenya, and the vast majority of imports that year came only from Nigeria, South Africa, Angola, Gabon, and Cote d'Ivoire. 
   In 1998, major U.S. exports to the region included machinery and transport equipment, such as aircraft and parts, civil engineering, equipment, data processing machines, as well as wheat. 
   Major United States imports from Africa include largely basic commodities such as crude oil which is the leading import by far, and some refined oils, 
    minerals and materials, including platinum and diamonds, and some agricultural commodities such as cocoa beans. 
   U.S. exports were much more diversified than U.S. imports. 
   The top 5 import items represent 75 percent of all U.S. imports from the region. 
   That dire lack of diversity is discouraging, but the holes in the United States-Africa trade picture tell also of a wealth of opportunity. 
   The investment picture is no better. 
   United States foreign direct investment in Africa, including northern Africa, at the end of 1997 was $10.3 billion, or 1 percent of all United States foreign direct investment. 
   Over half of the United States direct investment in Africa was in the petroleum sector. South Africa received the largest share of United States foreign direct investment in sub-Saharan Africa, and manufacturing accounted for the largest share of that investment. 
   Nigeria received the second largest share of United States foreign direct investment in Sub-Saharan Africa, and petroleum accounted for almost all of that investment.  
   What is missing here is the coherent development that can make the countries of Africa into a growing dynamic economic power with a healthy appetite for American products. 
   I hope my bill will help spark that development and drive up all of these meager trade statistics. 
   First, if offers trade benefits on a wider variety of products than is covered under competing proposals. 
   These provisions are designed to help African economies diversify their export base. 
   that's good for Africa, and good for us. 
   Second, as I have noted, my bill addresses the two biggest barriers to economic development in Africa--HIV/AIDS and debt. 
   In addition, it helps infuse into African economies a powerful engine of economic growth--small business. 
   The bill gives special attention to small- and women-owned businesses in Africa and it ensures that existing United States trade promotion mechanisms are made available to American small businesses seeking to do business in Africa. 
   That kind of attention to the economic fundamentals also is good for Africa and good for us. 
   My bill authorizes the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, to initiate one or more equity funds in support of infrastructure projects in sub-Saharan Africa, including basic health services, including HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, hospitals, potable water, sanitation, schools, electrification of rural areas, and publicly-accessible transportation. 
   It specifically requires that not less than 70 percent of equity funds be allocated to projects involving small- and women-owned businesses with substantial African ownership, thus ensuring that Africa truly gains from the provision. 
   It also specifies that a majority of funds be allocated to American small business. 
   Good for Africa and good for America. 
   This measure also ensures that the benefits of economic growth and development in Africa will be broad enough to allow African workers and African firms to buy American goods and services. 
   My bill explicitly requires compliance with internationally recognized standards of worker and human rights and environmental protections in order for countries to receive the additional trade benefits of the legislation. 
   The requirements are enforceable and allow for legal action to be taken by United States citizens when an African country fails to comply. 
   The bill also includes strong protections against the illegal transshipments of goods from their countries through Africa, and authorizes the provision of technical assistance to customs services in Africa. 
   Transshipment is frankly a sneaky practice employed by producers in China and other third party countries, especially in Asia. 
   Here's how it works: they establish sham production in countries which may export to the United States under more favorable conditions than those producers enjoy in their own countries. 
   Then they ship goods made in their factories at home and meant for the United States market to the third country, in this case an African country, pack it or assemble it in some minor way, and send it on to the United States marked ``Make in Africa,'' with all the benefits that label would bring. 
   If that happens in Africa, it will undermine our objectives--it will be bad for Africa, bad for the United States, and simply unjust. 
   These provisions are intended to ensure that the trade benefits in Africa accrue to African workers rather than non-African producers. 
   There is more talk of Africa in the Halls of Congress than we have heard in a long time. 
   I welcome that because we have hope for this kind of attention on the Senate Subcommittee on Africa for the seven years I have served on that committee. 
   The prospect of expanding trade with Africa has inspired many members to educate themselves about the changes taking place on the continent. 
   Now they have to accept the opportunity and the challenge those changes present. 
   Now they have to fix our trading relationship with Africa. 
   In our zeal to expand our trading relationship with selected countries, we must be mindful to do it in a manner that is sustainable. 
   I fear that some of the other alternatives that are out there are insufficient to meet and sustain the goals that we all share. 
   A better trade relationship for Africa has to be for the long term because its richest rewards will come in the long term. 
   Lasting, equitable, and effective expansion of commercial ties to the economies and peoples of Africa will require bold steps. 
   This legislation represents the first of those steps. I urge my colleagues to take up the tools we have to help the Nations of Africa build a more prosperous and just place on their continent. It is the right thing to do and the smart thing to do for America. Please join me in supporting the HOPE for Africa bill.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of our colleagues in support of prompt Senate consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the CTBT. 
   The issue of arms proliferation is at the heart of our national--and international--security. In the post-cold war world we are no longer faced with a military threat posed by the Soviet Union, but in some ways the world now is a more dangerous place than it was just a decade ago, with many smaller, unpredictable threats taking the place of a single large one. U.S. and international security are now threatened by transfers of nuclear, conventional and non-conventional materials among numerous states. Nuclear testing last year by India and Pakistan, the attempts of other states to obtain nuclear and ballistic missile technology, and the growing threat of weapons of mass destruction reinforce the need for a comprehensive international effort to end nuclear testing and curb the illicit transfer and sale of nuclear, ballistic, and other dangerous technology. 
   I have been a strong supporter of prompt Senate action on the CTBT since President Clinton submitted the treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent on September 22, 1997--2 years ago last week. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I continue to feel strongly that the committee should have thorough hearings specifically on this important treaty at the earliest possible date. I know that the chairman of the committee and I do not agree on the importance of the CTBT, but I hope he will agree that the Senate must fulfill its advice and consent obligations with respect to this treaty. 
   I continue to hear from numerous Wisconsin residents who favor prompt Senate action on--and ratification of--the CTBT. 
   The CTBT, which has been signed by more than 150 nations, prohibits the explosion of any type of nuclear device, no matter the intended purpose. India and Pakistan's nuclear tests only underscore the importance of the CTBT, and serve as a reminder that we should redouble our efforts to bring the entire community of nations into this treaty. While I am pleased that both of those countries have agreed to sign the treaty, I regret that they did so only after intense international pressure, and only after they conducted the tests they needed to become declared nuclear states. 
   We must do more to ensure that no further tests take place. 
   The United States must lead the world in reducing the nuclear threat, and to do that we must become a full participant in the treaty we helped to craft. I am deeply concerned that the third anniversary of the date the CTBT opened for signature, September 24, 1996, passed last week without Senate advice and consent to ratification. This failure to act by the United States Senate means that, according to the treaty's provisions, the United States will not be able to participate actively in the upcoming conference, which is reserved for only those countries who have deposited their instruments of ratification. That conference is currently scheduled to begin on October 6, 1999. Because we cannot participate, the United States will be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to influencing the future of the treaty and encouraging other countries to sign or ratify. 
   Mr. President, I again urge the Senate to act on this important treaty at the earliest possible date. The credibility and leadership of the United States in the arms control arena is at stake. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Honorable EDWARD KENNEDY, who received the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Freedom Medal in early May of this year. I ask that Ambassador William J. vanden Heuvel's remarks honoring Senator KENNEDY be printed in the RECORD following this statement. 
   The remarks follow. 
   The Four Freedoms: A Gateway to the New Millennium  
   Today, midst the renewal of life that Spring represents, we come to the valley of the Hudson River that Franklin Delano Roosevelt loved so very much. The President parents and four children of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt are buried in this country churchyard. We remember that three sovereigns of the Netherlands--Wilhelmina, Juliana and Beatrix came to this church to worship accompanied by it Senior Warden who was also the President of the United States. We welcome the Queen's High Commissioner. Wim van Gelder, and the delegation from Zeeland where the Roosevelt Study Center has established itself as a pre-eminent place of study of the American presidency. 
   Winston Churchill described Franklin Roosevelt as the greatest man he had ever known. President Roosevelt's life, Churchill said, ``must be regarded as one of the commanding events in human destiny.'' We listen once more to the words the President spoke to the Congress on January 6, 1941, as he defined the fundamental charter of democracy: [The voice of President Roosevelt as he spoke to the Congress of the United States on January 6, 1941] 
   ``In the future days, which we seek to make secure we look forward to a world founded upon four essential freedoms. The first is Freedom of Speech and Expression--everywhere in the world. The second is Freedom of every person to worship God in his own way--everywhere in the world. The third is Freedom from Want--which, translated into world terms, means economic understanding which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants--everywhere in the world. The fourth is Freedom from Fear--which, translated into world terms, means a worldwide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor--anywhere in the world.'' Freedom of Speech and Expression Freedom of Worship Freedom from Want Freedom from Fear 
   For ourselves, for our nations, for our world. Those are the reasons why we fought the most terrible war in human history--to secure those freedoms for our children and generations to come, to make possible for them the well-ordered society that only Democracy can assure, a community established by the consent of the governed, where the rule of law prevails, where freedom means respect for each other, and where fairness and decency and tolerance are the cherished values, where government protects the powerless while encouraging everyone to nourish the spirit and substance of our land. 
   Franklin Roosevelt was the voice of the people of the United States during the most difficult crises of the century. He led America out of the despair of the Great Depression. He led us to victory in the Great War. Four times he was elected President of the United States. By temperament and talent, by energy and instinct, Franklin Roosevelt came to the presidency, ready for the challenges that confronted him. He was a breath of fresh air in our political life--so vital, so confident and optimistic, so warm and good humored. He was a man of incomparable personal courage. At the age of 39, he was stricken with infantile paralysis. He would never walk or stand again unassisted. We can feel the pain of his struggle--learning to move again, to stand, to rely upon the physical support of others--never giving into despair, to self-pity, to discouragement. Just twelve years after he was stricken, he was elected President of a country itself paralyzed by the most fearful economic depression of its history. He lifted America from its knees and led us to our fateful rendezvous with history. The majesty of that triumph can never be dimmed. 
   He transformed our government into an active instrument of social justice. He made America the arsenal of democracy. He was Commander-in-Chief of the greatest military force in history. He crafted the victorious alliance that won the war. He was the father of the nuclear age. He inspired and guided the blueprint for the world that was to follow. The vision of the United Nations, the commitment to collective security, the determination to end colonialism, the opportunity of peace and prosperity for all people--everywhere in the world. Such was the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt. 
   President Roosevelt spoke in simple terms that everyone understood. Civilization needs a police force, he said, just as every one of our communities look to their local police for security and protection against the lawless. Adolf Hitler and his Nazi hoodlums brought the world to the precipice of destruction. Franklin Roosevelt was the first among the world's leaders to denounce and confront the savagery of the Nazis. The tin horn dictators who trample democratic values today when they carry out ethnic cleansing and murder innocent people, destroying their children and their hopes, are in the same gangster tradition. It is Franklin Roosevelt's legacy to nullify their power by collective action. If the freedoms, which are the essence of civilization, are only rhetoric unworthy of defense and sacrifice, they will not prosper. They will perish. 
   The America that President Roosevelt left us was prepared for the challenge of the New Frontier. Despite the trouble and turbulence of the 20th century, there is much of which we can be proud. We have a nation based upon the consent of the governed. We must cause it once again to be respectful of the opinions of Mankind. We have amassed wealth that has never been equaled. We have brought together all of the world's races and creeds and shown that we can live together in peace and common purpose. We have spent our treasure and spilled our blood to prevent tyrants from destroying the possibilities of freedom and liberty. 
   Neither President Roosevelt nor we who share his vision are projecting a Utopia, a place liberated of all human trouble, where no one shall want for anything. No, the Four Freedoms are not a vision of a distant millennium, but rather the basis of a world attainable in our own time and generation. 
   It is the purpose of this day to honor five laureates whose lives and achievements give us hope that our cherished freedoms will endure as our Republic will endure. 
   It is my privilege and honor to bestow the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Four Freedoms Medals.  
   Award of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Freedom Medal to Edward Moore Kennedy 
   ``We look forward,'' President Roosevelt told Congress and an embattled world on January 6, 1941, ``to a world founded upon four essential freedoms''--Freedom of Speech and Expression, Freedom of Worship, Freedom from Want, Freedom from Fear. 
   On this 7th day of May, 1999, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Freedom Medal is awarded to Edward Moore Kennedy whose commitment to peace and social justice and whose brilliant command of the parliamentary process have made him the most influential Senator of his era, esteemed by his colleagues, and respected and admired throughout the world. 
   Six times the voters of Massachusetts have elected you to the Senate of the United States. Like the great leaders of this century, you have been the target of doubt, derision, ridicule and hatred, but to your enemies' everlasting disappointment, you have endured and prevailed, fortified by an inner strength that caused each fateful assault to leave you stronger, more determined, and more effective. 
   You have been much more than the heir to a great political dynasty. You have been the executor of its legacy, a pioneer forever advancing the new frontiers of equal opportunity and American purpose. Born into a  family of wealth and influence, you created an independent career that has profoundly enriched the Kennedy saga and given voice and power precisely to those who, lacking wealth and influence, have been denied the opportunity of the American dream. 
   In the struggle for civil rights, your eloquence has been the trumpet of our leadership. You are the inexhaustible champion of racial justice and minority rights, of better schools, of the protection of the environment, of care and concern for the casualties of a market society--of those left out of America's historic prosperity. No one has done more to provide healthcare for all Americans. You have built extraordinary coalitions--and when necessary you have stood alone--in extending insurance coverage, in controlling costs, in protecting the vulnerable, in advancing medical research. You have fought for a social security system that truly assures security. You have led the fight for the minimum wage and the rights of labor, for equal opportunity for women, for the protection of children and for all those caught in the web of poverty. What the New Deal established, you advanced. You are the defender of past social gains and the designer of new social opportunities. Your capacity for friendship, your graciousness and good humor, your willingness to do the tedious homework that makes you a master of legislative detail has enabled you to overcome partisan divisions. You have achieved extraordinary results without compromising principle. 
   In world affairs, you are a champion of peace and international understanding. Northern Ireland has the hope of peace today in large part because of your outspoken opposition to violence and terrorism and your untiring support of those on the front line working for justice and reconciliation. The developing nations of the world know you as their friend, and the United Nations esteems you as an American leader who is determined to see our country fulfill its responsibilities of leadership. 
   Your life has not been absent adversity and pain but that has not lessened your determination to strive, to seek, to find and never yield in the quest for a better world. In 1980 bringing your campaign to an end, you said: ``..... But for all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.'' You have been faithful to that promise. Those words define our purpose with this award. You have understood and enhanced the great message of the Four freedoms as Franklin Delano Roosevelt meant them. Therefore, in his name, we honor--and we thank you.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her tremendous determination and leadership on this issue. I have watched this effort from the beginning, and her enthusiasm and determination is really making a difference. I am extremely impressed with it. 
   My purpose is to rise again in opposition to the Hutchison amendment. Earlier in the debate on this amendment, I engaged in a colloquy with the Senator from California about the relationship between campaign contributions and the continued reappearance of this amendment. I believe this is the fourth time similar provisions have been offered or contained in the Interior appropriations bill, just since May of 1998.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, since we have been engaged in debate on the Interior bill, four major oil companies have reached tentative agreements with U.S. prosecutors who accused them of cooperating in schemes to shortchange the Government through their royalty payments by millions of dollars. A tentative settlement, which was filed in Federal court in Lufkin, TX, involved about $185 million in payments and would end a case that alleged that companies underpaid royalties by undervaluating oil extracted from Federal and American Indian lands. 
   Though the settlement has not yet been finalized, it is a very serious matter. Chevron USA, Inc.; BP American Inc.; Amoco Oil Co.; and Conoco, Inc.; agreed in principle to settle for $95 million, $32 million, $32 million, and $26 million, respectively. The Wall Street Journal reported that a 1996 lawsuit by two former Atlantic Richfield employees alleges that 18 companies, their affiliates and subsidiaries, knowingly defrauded the Government on royalties derived from the production of crude oil from land spanning more than 27 million acres in 21 States. 
   The Justice Department entered the case against Conoco; Amoco; Burlington Resources; the Shell Oil Company; Occidental Petroleum; Texaco, Inc.; and the Unocal Corporation, which resulted in the recent settlements. The Government is seeking triple damages of about $5 billion from all the companies. The Interior Department has billed the oil companies more than $400 million for the alleged underpayment of Federal royalties, stretching back two decades. 
   The Wall Street Journal article I referred to, reports that these recent settlements aren't even the first of their kind. Several companies have been negotiating settlements. The Mobil Corporation agreed last year to pay $45 million, and Occidental Petroleum Corporation agreed in early September to pay $7.3 million. 
   I think this is a very troubling trend as these lawsuits are settled. I am very concerned that Congress is abdicating its responsibility. Unintentionally or not, Congress is making it possible for this issue to continue to go unaddressed because the royalty underpayment situation is the issue that this rulemaking we are debating seeks to correct. 
   The proponents of this amendment have stated their concerns that regulators are straying onto Congress' turf by amending the regulations. Proponents of this amendment say they want Congress to act on this matter; otherwise, the increase in royalties would amount to a type of ``taxation without representation.'' 
   I have to respectfully disagree with that argument. It ignores the fact that our Government agencies regularly update their regulations and they are authorized to do so by Congress. We don't require Congress to act every single time a regulation needs to be changed. We would never be able to get to it. 
   For example, Congress enacted the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. That law is intended to provide for orderly leasing of these lands, while affording protection for the environment and ensuring that the Federal Government receive fair market value for both lands leased and the production that might result. The Outer Continental Shelf Program is carried out by the Minerals Management Service of the Department of the Interior. Thus, Congress delegated the power to set royalties to MMS. 
   In addition to ignoring the fact that Congress passed laws which give the MMS the ability to set royalties, this argument that has been made rings hollow when you consider that Congress is not acting to prevent the underpayment of royalties with this amendment. What it is doing is preventing the Interior Department from doing anything about it at all. 
   So this raises the question: Why is Congress doing nothing about this problem? I think, certainly, the public will want to know why. The alleged underpayments involve more than 6,000 onshore and offshore leases in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, 
   California, Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Colorado, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming. 
   So this is not just a coastal States problem, or even just a Western problem. It affects a broad number of States, and it deserves attention as a national problem, the kind of attention the Senator from California has brought to it. 
   I have no doubt that one of the factors contributing to Congress' inaction on this issue of great importance to American taxpayers is the role of campaign contributions in the political process. So I want to review the figures I briefly presented when I ``Called the Bankroll'' last time I joined the Senator from California on the floor. I call the bankroll from time to time in this Chamber to remind my colleagues and the public about the undeniable, but sometimes hidden, role that money plays in the decisions we make. 
   During the 1997-1998 election cycle, the very large oil companies that will benefit from this amendment gave the following political donations to the parties and to Federal candidates: 
   Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in PAC money; Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than $330,000 in PAC money; Atlantic Richfield gave more than $525,000 in soft money and $150,000 in PAC money; BP Oil and Amoco, two oil companies that have merged into the newly formed petroleum giant, BP Amoco, gave a combined total of more than $480,000 in soft money and $295,000 in PAC money. 
   So if you put that together, that is more than $2.9 million just from those  four corporations in the span of only 2 years. They want the Hutchison amendment to be part of the Interior appropriations bill. As powerful political donors, I am afraid they are likely to get their way. 
   You will notice that all of these companies except for Exxon gave more to the political parties in soft money than their PACs gave to individual candidates. So, remember, and this is a key thing about soft money, which I don't think everybody in the country realizes; it took me a while to get it. Soft money comes right out of the corporate treasury, right out of the treasury. This isn't money where you form a PAC and you get employees to contribute to it; it comes straight out of the corporate treasury. 
   I am happy to yield without yielding my right to the floor. I ask unanimous consent that I can yield briefly to the Senator from North Dakota so he can make a request.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you. Let me get back to this point. 
   Of the four companies I mentioned, only one of the four--that being Exxon--didn't give more soft money than they did PAC money. The point I am trying to make is a very important point about what is going on with these campaign contributions. This money came straight out of corporate treasuries. 
   I would have thought a few years ago that these kinds of donations were illegal. They are supposed to be essentially illegal under our Federal elections law.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I believe this presentation is entirely relevant to this issue. I am going through the way in which these corporations can technically legally provide this kind of help to this cause of trying to make this change. That is merely the background I am giving at this point. 
   So let me return to the present. Soft money has grown exponentially since those early days when corporate contributions were just going to give the parties a little breathing room to cover party-building activities, not campaigns. In the last Presidential campaign, in 1996, the parties raised $262 million in soft money, three times as much as in the 1992 election cycle. The experts project we will see perhaps as much as $500 million or even $600 million in this next election, and about 65 percent of the money is coming from corporate treasuries. 
   So as we look at an issue, such as Senator BOXER's concern with the Hutchison amendment, we have to realize that what is before us is not simply an amendment. It is an amendment supported by interests that have been involved in an immense infusion of corporate cash that, unfortunately, is totally legal, even though I certainly don't think it should be. We wonder why the American people are skeptical of what we are doing. We have heard the horror stories again and again. Parties have special clubs for big givers and offer to the donors exclusive meetings and weekend retreats with office holders. And it is totally legal. 
   In other cases, in other bills, so we know this isn't an isolated incident, the tobacco companies have funneled nearly $17 million in soft money to the national political parties.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I believe it is clear that what I am saying is not simply in the context of a debate on campaign finance reform, and that the Members of the Senate and the American people should hear and understand the kind of money that is behind legislation on the floor of the Senate. 
   I think it is relevant to this debate. I think it is relevant to the debate on the subject matter involved. I have in the past 
   on a number of occasions taken the opportunity to raise this issue. I have spoken about campaign money in connection with 9 or 10 other bills, without objection from anyone, to point out the money that is involved in those bills. As you know, my presentation here has not been exclusively on the topic of campaign money. I have talked about the merits as well. I believe both are relevant, and I certainly would dispute the notion that this is in any way appropriate for a point of order.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate having the floor returned. I appreciate the ruling of the Chair. 
   Let me say that any attempt to gag the discussion on the floor of the Senate about the impact of soft money on this place is something I will fight tooth and nail with my colleagues on, and I was prepared, if necessary, had the Chair ruled against me to appeal. But I am grateful for the ruling and the precedents. 
   There is a notion that somehow saying the oil companies have contributed money means we are accusing somebody of something illegal, or something that can't be done. But that isn't a necessary conclusion. Contributions can be given innocently, but if the impact is that the process is greatly affected and the judgment is affected by the power of that money, I think it is relevant to this debate. 
   That is my concern about soft money. It is not so much the contributions given to individual Senators. Individual Members can't take soft money. It is this new phenomenon of the very large soft money contributions being given to political parties that I think has changed this place in a way that is extremely troubling and has allowed some amendments such as the one before the Senate today to get the kind of credibility I don't think they would have had without the power of soft money. 
   We have heard the horror stories again and again. Parties have special clubs for big givers and offer exclusive meetings and weekend retreats with officeholders to the donors. It is totally legal. In response to the Senator from Louisiana, I can see it is legal. I am not suggesting that these parties or industries are involved in illegal activity; it is legal, but it should be illegal. It is distorting to the process. 
   The tobacco companies have funneled nearly $17 million in soft money to the national parties in the last decade, $4.4 million in 1997 alone, when the whole issue of congressional action on the tobacco settlement was very much alive, and it is totally legal. In 1996, the gambling industry gave nearly $4 million in soft money to the two major political parties at the same time that Congress was creating a new national commission on gambling but with limited subpoena powers. It is totally legal. 
   There are some in this body, despite what the Thompson investigation uncovered a few years ago and what news stories show on almost a daily basis, who don't see or won't acknowledge the corrupting influence of these unlimited soft money contributions which again are now totally legal. 
   I remember a history lesson that one of our colleagues, the junior Senator from Utah, gave during a debate on campaign finance reform a few years ago that was intended to convince Members there was nothing wrong at all with enormous campaign contributions. He recounted the very frequently told story of how Senator Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968 was jump-started by some very large contributions by some very wealthy individuals. 
   He also noted that Steve Forbes was apparently prepared to make similar contributions to support Jack Kemp for a run for the Presidency in 1996 but was prohibited from doing so by the Federal elections law and decided to run his own campaign, a decision from which we might infer that money is more important than the candidate. 
   He also recounted the story of Mr. Arthur Hyatt, a wealthy businessman who gave large soft money contributions to the Democratic Party in 1996 but decided after the election not to give soft money to the parties anymore but instead to fund an advocacy group that is promoting public financing of elections. 
   The point of the examples was to try to argue that wealthy donors are motivated by ideology and to benefit the public as they see it, rather than the desire to gain access and influence with policymakers through their contributions. I suppose that could sometimes be the case. 
   Of course, there are other examples, including the candid story of the well-known incident of Mr. Roger Tamraz who testified under oath to our Governmental Affairs Committee that he never even votes and the only reason he gave soft money to the DNC was to gain access to officials he thought could help him with his business. It is my strong suspicion that Mr. Tamraz' motives, if not his methods, are more typical of big contributors than are those of Steve Forbes or the millionaires who funded Eugene McCarthy's 
   campaign.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I am shocked at the efforts of my colleagues to gag one of their colleagues who is trying to talk about a reality in this country that has occurred with regard to these campaign contributions that affect what we are doing on this amendment. The notion that somehow I should stop speaking while the Chair reviews the precedents is absurd. A Senator should be allowed to speak as long as he is permitted under the rules to do so, and there has been no such ruling otherwise.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I will not yield for a question at this point. I will later.  
   Mr. President, I am not cynical about this. There is a reason I hold suspicions about the motives of soft money donors. The reason is, a solid majority of soft money contributions to our political parties, as I mentioned before, comes from corporate interests. It simply cannot be argued that those interests are acting out of a public spiritedness or ideological conviction. Corporations do not have an ideology; they have business interests. They have a bottom line to defend. They have learned over the years that making contributions to the major political parties in this country is a very good investment in their bottom line. Unfortunately, too often campaign money buys access and access often pays off at the bottom line. 
   Corporate interests are special interests. Special interests have self-interested motives. They are concerned with profits, not only what is best for citizens or consumers or the country as a whole. They like to cast their arguments in terms of the public interest, and I am sure sometimes their beliefs are genuine. And they certainly will argue that if Congress follows their advice on legislation, the public will be better off. But in the end, it is their own businesses they most care of and not necessarily the broader public good. 
   Indeed, the boards of directors and management of corporations actually have a legal duty--this is not a criticism of the corporations at all--to act in the best interests of their shareholders. They are supposed to do that, not to think of the broader public at large. 
   Let me make it clear to those Senators concerned about my remarks, there is not a suggestion here that the corporations are acting illegally or suggesting that there is something wrong with 
   corporations doing what they should can for their own interests. I have no illusions about it. It is OK with me that the corporate special interests are looking out for No. 1 in the public debate. But I must object, and object loudly and over and over again, when their deep pockets give them deep influence that ordinary Americans simply don't have. 
   Corporations with business before the Congress, not disinterested, public-spirited millionaires, and certainly not ordinary citizens, lead the way in soft money giving. One interesting set of contributors proves that access, not ideology, is the main reason for soft money donations. In the 1996 election cycle, 40 companies gave over $150,000 to both political parties. Guess what. Three of those double-givers were the oil companies I have already mentioned here today. Double-givers, they give to both parties: Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum. They cover their bases. This is not always about choosing sides, but covering bases. 
   I suppose there might be some in the companies or in this body who argue that the double-givers just want to assist the political process, that they are motivated not by the bottom line but by a keen desire to assist both parties in serving the public. If that is the case, why is it, in every Congress since I have been here, the industries most seriously affected by our work give huge contributions to Members and to the political parties? 
   In 1993-1994, it was the health care debate. Hospital insurance companies, drug companies, and doctors all opened up their wallets in an unprecedented way. In 1995 and 1996, the Telecommunications Act was under consideration, and, lo and behold, the local and long-distance companies and cable companies stepped up giving. In the last Congress--and this one, for that matter--we have been working on bankruptcy reform and financial services modernization. The biggest givers of all in the 1998 cycle, according to Common Cause research, was security and investment companies, insurance companies, banks, and lenders eager to have business interests protected or expanded. 
   What is going on here? I suggest this is not a spontaneous burst of civic virtue. Since we didn't finish work on the bills last year, the money is flowing again this year. It has even been suggested that sometimes the very Members of Congress who most want a big bill to pass will slow progress to keep the checks flowing in. That such a view of legislators and public servants has gained currency in the public debate, even if it is true, 
   shows the depths of cynicism that this soft money system has inspired in those we represent. 
   Mr. President, the American people are not gullible or naive. They know that these companies contribute these enormous sums to the parties because their bottom line is affected by what the Congress does and they want to make sure the Congress will listen to them when they want to make their case. And they know that the big contributors get results. We are seeing another example of that here today. 
   And frankly, it's a two-way street. The parties are hitting up these donors because they know that most companies, unlike Monsanto and General Motors have announced early in 1997 that they would no longer make soft money donations--most companies don't have the courage to say no. Most companies are worried that if they don't ante up, their lobbyists won't get in the door. Our current campaign finance laws encourage old fashioned shakedowns, as long as they are done discreetly. 
   A growing number of business leaders are objecting to this system, and recognizing that it must be changed. The business group CED, the Committee for Economic Development, has come out for a ban on soft money, and I think we will see more and more business leaders embracing campaign finance reform in the future. An unhealthy democracy is not healthy for business. 
   It is beyond me how any Senator could support this soft money system. In a few weeks, we will have a chance to vote on a bill that bans soft money. Senator MCCAIN and I are looking forward to that debate, and I want to thank the Senator from California for giving me the opportunity to talk about it this morning, as part of her fight against this ill-advised amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. If we can pass a soft money ban this year, perhaps there will be fewer of these special interest deals to contend with in the future. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just want to make one clarification concerning the colloquy between the majority leader and the Chair. I have no disagreement with the statements of the Chair concerning the Senate rule on germaneness during the post-cloture debate. However, the majority leader prefaced his inquiry with the statement that it was his understanding that some debate on the oil royalties amendment was not germane. I want to make clear that there was never a ruling that any particular statement made during the debate by any Senator was not germane. I am confident that my remarks during this debate were germane to the issue at hand and I do not interpret the Chair's statement in this colloquy to have suggested or ruled otherwise.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss possible legislation that would devastate family dairy farmers throughout the Upper Midwest. 
   I understand that the Agriculture appropriations conference committee may report a bill that contains poison pill dairy amendment that threaten the livelihood of dairy farmers throughout the United States. 
   I call them poison pills because they threaten to scuttle the entire Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   It is my duty to my constituents as a Senator from the great dairy State of Wisconsin to make my colleagues aware of these possible actions, and their insidious effects on America's dairy industry, and the effect they may have on our ability to move legislation in these waning days of the 104th Congress. 
   Our current system is hopelessly out-of-date, and completely out-of-touch with reality. Fortunately for our farmers--and I am grateful for this--the USDA has proposed a rule that would begin to modernize our antiquated system. 
   According to the Secretary of Agriculture, the new system ``more accurately reflects the current market condition, is fairer to farmers and consumers alike, modernizes and reforms an antiquated system sorely in need of streamlining and revision.'' 
   In fact, according to the USDA, dairy farmers would have earned 87 cents per hundredweight more for Class I milk under USDA's reforms than under the current system. 
   For 60 years, America's dairy policy has both imposed higher costs on taxpayers and consumers, and at the same time destroyed tens of thousands of family farms. 
   This destructive policy has to go. We need to restore equality to milk pricing, stop regional bickering, and work to ensure that all of our Nation's dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk. My message is simple: our Federal dairy policy is hopelessly out of date, fundamentally unfair, and in dire need of reform. 
   Congress created the current Federal dairy policy 60 years ago 
   when the upper Midwest was seen as the primary producer of fluid milk. During the Great Depression, many worried that consumers in other parts of the country, including young children, did not have access to fresh milk because of inadequate refrigeration and transportation technology. 
   To address these concerns, Congress at that time set up the so-called Eau Claire system, under which producers were reimbursed according to their distance from the small town--I shouldn't say small town; it is a pretty good-size town for Wisconsin--the great town of Eau Claire, WI, in my home State. It is a little unfair to call this the Eau Claire system because it is a lousy system and Eau Claire is a great town. I like calling it the anti-Eau Claire system. My daughter is happily ensconced at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, a huge fan of Eau Claire. But it is generally called the Eau Claire system. So be it. 
   This is how it works. The farther away a farmer lives from Eau Claire, WI, the more he receives for his fluid milk. Under this system, Eau Claire, WI, geographically, is ground zero when the fallout of artificially low prices lands most harshly on Wisconsin dairy farmers and their neighbors in the upper Midwest. 
   Back in the days of the Great Depression, apparently this system seemed to be a great idea. But like delivery in old metal milk cans, the current system is obsolete, failing to meet the needs of either producers or consumers. Six decades ago, the poor condition of America's infrastructure and the lack of portable refrigeration technology prevented upper Midwest producers from shipping their fresh milk to other parts of the country. In order to ensure an adequate milk supply in distant regions, Congress authorized higher fluid milk prices outside the upper Midwest. These higher prices are referred to as class I differentials. Let's take a look at how this system rewards producers in different parts of the country. 
   This chart illustrates the class I differential received by dairy farmers throughout the United States. In Eau Claire, WI, the class I differential is $1.20 per hundredweight. You will notice that it is $1.40 in Chicago. It is $1.92 in Kansas City, MO, and $3.08 in Charlotte, NC. Our friends in Florida receive $3.58 in Tallahassee and $4.18 per hundredweight in Miami for the exact same amount of milk that we produce in Wisconsin. So class I differentials are an arbitrary measure of the cost of milk production. 
   In fact, in recent years, when our dairy farmers have tried to sell their milk in Chicago--in Chicago, a very close distance to Eau Claire and the other Wisconsin communities compared to other places in the country--when they have tried to sell their milk in Chicago, they have been beaten out of that market by milk from the South and the Southwest. That is a sign of an archaic system. This archaic system was designed to make these regions produce milk for their own needs so children in Texas could have fresh milk, not so their producers could unfairly compete against Wisconsin dairy farmers in Chicago. Unfortunately, this system worked too well. The chief result of this system, the only real result of this system, as far as I am concerned, is that our Midwestern farmers are now subsidizing farmers in the Southeast and in the Northeast through these higher class I differentials. 
   Of course, a great deal has changed since the creation of the current system. We can now easily and safely transport 
   perishable milk and cheese products between the States and throughout the country. The industry has perfected the system to such a degree that we can export cheese to countries all over the world. It seems almost comical that in an age when you can order milk through the Internet, our Federal milk pricing system continues to be based on an irrelevant factor. That factor, again, is a producer's distance from this wonderful Wisconsin community of Eau Claire, WI. That is what this whole thing is based on, how far the farmer is from Eau Claire, WI. 
   Unfortunately, the current system's effects on farming communities are  anything but common. The current milk pricing system has been putting family dairy farms out of business at an alarming rate. Since 1980, my home State of Wisconsin has sadly lost nearly one-half of its dairy farms. This isn't starting with 2,000 or 3,000 dairy farmers. This is starting with 45,000-plus dairy farmers. We are below 25,000 now. That is since 1980 that we have experienced that kind of loss. 
   The trend is accelerating. Between 1990 and 1998, in those 8 to 9 years, Wisconsin lost 11,000 dairy farmers. So the overwhelming message I hear from family dairy farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota and throughout the Midwest is that we need milk marketing order reforms. We desperately need a new dairy policy, one that does not arbitrarily penalize the Midwest and devastate the small farmer. We must replace this outdated Depression-era system with a new policy that ensures our Nation's dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk. 
   Ironically, one of the few changes, one of the only changes, we have had at all to Federal dairy policy over the last 60 years has accelerated the attack on small farmers. It has made it worse. Of course, I am referring to the now infamous Northeast Dairy Compact. 
   During the consideration of the 1996 farm bill, Congress sought to make changes in the unjust Federal pricing system by phasing out the milk price support program and reducing the inequities between the regions. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Unfortunately, because of backdoor politicking during the eleventh hour of the conference committee, America's dairy farmers were stuck with the devastatingly harmful Northeast Dairy Compact. It could happen again. The temporary fix of the compact may yet be extended again. We in the upper Midwest cannot stand for that or any change that further disadvantages our dairy farmers, the ones who are left, not the over 20,000 who are gone but the less than 25,000 who remain. We are determined to keep them in business. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact accentuates the current system's inequities by authorizing six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut--to establish a minimum price for fluid milk, higher even than those established under the Federal milk marketing order. The compact not only allows these six States to set artificially high prices for their producers, it permits them to block entry of lower-priced milk from producers in competing States. Further distorting the markets are subsidies given to processors in these six States to export their higher-priced milk to noncompact States. 
   Despite what some have argued, the Northeast Dairy Compact doesn't even help small Northeast farmers. Since the Northeast first implemented its compact in 1997, small dairy farms in the Northeast, where this is supposed to help, have gone out of business at a rate of 41 percent higher than they had in the previous 2 years--41 percent higher. In fact, compacts often amount to a transfer of wealth to large farms by affording large farms a per-farm subsidy that is actually 20 times greater than the meager subsidy given to small farmers. 
   Fortunately for America's dairy farmers, the 1996 farm bill also included language requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to replace the current depression-era milk pricing system with a much simpler regulatory plan. After 3 1/2 years of study and thousands of comments from America's dairy farmers, the USDA published a final rule that consolidates the complex web of Federal milk marketing orders and also reforms the price of class I milk. 
   Mr. President, 59,000 dairy farmers--59,000--participated in a recent referendum, and over 96 percent of them voted in favor of USDA's final ruling. 
   While the USDA's reforms are a welcome improvement, they are only a modest first step in improving the current system. 
   Let's take a look, then, at the final rule's effect on the different milk marketing orders. This chart illustrates the producer class I benefits under the current system, and the USDA's Federal milk marketing order rule. This benefit simply multiplies the class I differential with the utilization rate, or the percentage of class I milk produced in that region. As you can see, upper Midwest producers will continue to get the short end of the stick. They will receive a 38-cent-per-hundredweight benefit under the new rule. In contrast, Northeast producers will continue to receive a high per hundredweight benefit of $1.20, and producers in Florida will receive a whopping $3.95 per hundredweight class I benefit. 
   Unless we follow-up on these reforms and lower the class I differentials, we will continue to lose small dairy farms throughout the United States. Loss of these farms has already devastated rural America for far too long, especially in the upper Midwest. 
   Mr. President, unfortunately, our Nation's dairy farmers are not out of the woods yet. Some in Congress believe that they know better than America's dairy farmers and wish to prevent these moderate reforms, or to circumvent the entire rulemaking process altogether. Who in this Congress knows more about dairy farming than 96 percent of America's dairy farmers? 
   As Congress considers any future dairy reforms, I urge my colleagues to recognize the national nature of milk marketing, the corrosiveness of artificial regional pricing schemes, and the need for comprehensive reforms. We must recognize the inequalities inherent in our current system and work to ensure that our Nation's dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk. 
   If Congress does not act quickly, our Nation's family dairy farms will continue to suffer. Let me be clear. I will use every means available to a Senator to ensure that these necessary reforms go forward and that compacts do not. America's dairy farmers deserve nothing less. 
   After all, approving USDA's final rule is a moderate first step to arresting the devastating effects of the current Federal milk marketing order system. 
   Dairy compacts are simply no way to legislate a national dairy policy. I would like to make my colleagues aware of some of the effects the dairy compacts can have on consumers and taxpayers. 
   Let me begin by citing from an article called ``Dairy Compacts A Sour Deal For All U.S. Farmers.'' The sub-headline is, ``The Agreements Threaten to Undermine Export Growth For The Rest Of American Agriculture,'' by Dennis T. Avery, of the Hudson Institute. It says:  
   Enthusiasm for ``dairy compacts'' is sweeping America. Nearly 30 states now seem likely to pass legislation for such compacts, which are designed to bar dairy products from outside a state or region.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the New York Times has written a piece about ``Bringing Markets To Milk,'' ``A Pricing Policy Was Confusing. It Still Is,'' by Mr. Weinstein. I would like to read some portions of that. He writes: 
   Ponder a perverse question: What public policies would pummel the poor? Here is one answer: Impose a levy that falls more heavily on them than on the rich, singling out a staple in the diet of poor families and driving up its price. 
   No one would seriously entertain such an idea--no one, that is, except members of Congress. 
   Federal milk-pricing rules dating from the 1930's drive up the price that consumers pay for milk, in effect taking money from urban parents, among others, and handing it over to rural dairy farmers. 
   Proponents say the rules stabilize milk prices, thereby assuring reliable supplies across the country. But opponents say the system is archaic, Byzantine and unnecessary--a giveaway to the dairy farm lobby. And it's regressive: poor families spend about twice as much of their income on milk as do other families, on average. 
   Consumer advocates took heart three years ago when Congress told the Agriculture Department to improve the program. But their hopes were dashed recently when the department released its proposals, scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1. 
   The new rules, the department said, would be ``simpler, more market-oriented.'' But rather than taking a mallet to the program, the department wielded a toothpick. John M. Schnittker, an economist at Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a nonprofit research group in Washington that plans to merge with the Consumer Federation of America, estimates that the current program raises the cost of milk an average of 18 cents a gallon. The department says its plan will cut prices by about 2 cents--a trim Mr. Schnittker calls ``almost an insult.'' 
   The current rules impose a complex set of minimum prices that processors are requited to pay farmers in each of the 31 marketing regions. 
   The department starts by setting a base price for milk used in the manufacture of products like cheese from a survey of prices in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Then it tacks on additional charges, mostly reflecting location, to set the minimum price for so-called fluid milk. 
   Kenneth C. Clayton, deputy administrator of the agency that runs the system, says the controls stop milk prices from gyrating wildly and make sure that milk flows from areas where there are surplus supplies, like upstate New York and Wisconsin, to areas where there is scarcity, like Boston and Chicago. 
   But he concedes that those flows would occur without Government guidance. What the rules do, he says, is ``divide up the pie--insuring that dairy farmers capture more of the dollar that consumers pay to processors.'' Another set of complex rules dictates how the processors' payments are divided among farmers. 
   Many economists challenge Mr. Clayton's benign interpretation. Processors operate in reasonably competitive markets, the economists say, so if they are forced to pay more for milk, they have little choice but to pass on the added cost to customers. Mr. Schnittker points to studies that show consumer prices rising along with Government-imposed charges on processors. 
   He also challenges another rationale for the milk-pricing rules: Preservation of the family farmer. ``Two-thirds of milk production comes from only about a quarter of the nation's dairy farmers,'' he said. ``The milk-pricing rules overwhelmingly line the pockets of mega dairy farms.'' 
   The government's overhaul would simplify things by collapsing the 31 regions into 11. But it would also make the system more complicated, by setting the base price for milk use in manufactured products according to surveys around the country, rather than just the Midwest, and by adjusting the price to take into account the milk's protein content and other qualities using complex mathematical formulas. 
   Add charges to take account of location and some transition rules, and out come 600-plus pages of regulations. Some economists suggest that the rule-making would fit comfortably in the playbook of the former Soviet Union. 
   And though the proposal would bring down average milk prices a small amount, it would leave most of the high prices intact. Indeed, the proposal would actually raise the minimum price in some places, like Chicago, a decision more political than economic. 
   Critics point out that this is not the first time the Agriculture Department has sided with dairy farmers over consumers. It also approved the creation of a dairy cartel among farmers in the Northeast that blocks low-price imports. Milk prices in New England rose about 20 cents a gallon after the compact went into effect in July 1997.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, since the question has been raised, I think it is time to review what has happened on the floor of the Senate and in the Congress on this issue in the past. 
   What has happened on this issue is that we have fought this battle fair and square in the Senate, won the battle, and then every time we get to conference committee, somehow the will of this body is undone. In 1996, we had the only rollcall vote on the issue of the New England Dairy Compact, the Northeast Dairy Compact. I remember staying up until late at night lobbying Members, and we had a vote fair and square on whether or not we were going to set up this actually absurd notion of a New England Dairy Compact. 
   So what did we do? We won the vote fair and square. I think it was something like 50-46. I remember the wonderful help and support I received from the distinguished majority leader at the time, Senator Dole, in feeling it was a tough battle--one of these tough inter-regional battles--not a Republican or Democrat issue but that we had won fair and square. The House had not voted on the issue, but then they go over to the conference committee, and in the middle of the night, without any basis from the action of either House, they just stick in the conference committee the idea that the Secretary of Agriculture could create a region in New England that would establish an artificially high price for milk for only one part of the country to the disadvantage of farmers everywhere else. 
   That is how we got here. This was part of the so-called Freedom to Farm Act. 
   We had hopes that the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, for whom I have great regard and have enjoyed working with, would understand what a mistake it would be to create this compact in the first place. We did everything we could to persuade him not to go down this road--that it wouldn't make sense; that it wouldn't save northeastern dairy farmers; that it wouldn't help consumers, and, in fact, would hurt consumers; that it would drive up production artificially in a way that would reduce prices for dairy farmers. 
   I believe that is exactly what happened. 
   Secretary Glickman is a bright guy, and he has an open mind. He watched this for a year and a half. He concluded that the New England Dairy Compact was not a good idea and proposed, along with his suggestions on changing the milk marketing order system, that we not have it anymore, that it expire. 
   We pointed out on the floor of the Senate on many occasions how this notion of a dairy compact, a regional economy for milk, could be applied in other situations. Perhaps we should say all the maple syrup in Vermont and States in that region should be sold, bought, and consumed in that one area and not exported to the rest of the country. Others have said we could do the same thing with blueberries. There would be a southern or Georgia peanut region, and all the peanuts grown there would have to be sold and consumed there. There would be an artificially high price for peanuts there but not anywhere else. Others carried it further. Since we associate the great city of Seattle, the State of Washington, with computers, why not have computers sold in the Northwest? 
   I found even more interesting the notion that country music should only be marketed in States such as Tennessee and Kentucky. I happen to be a fan of country music, so I find that troubling, although some of my younger staffers would be delighted if we had that kind of limitation on country music. I don't think they like it. 
   That is what this is, an artificial corruption of what should be a national dairy system. I don't mean corruption in the sense of impropriety; I mean in the sense of undercutting the notion of free enterprise in which the dairy industry should be able to participate. The Secretary reviewed it, and he concluded we shouldn't have this anymore. 
   There has been an effort on the Senate floor and throughout the summer on and off to attach the New England Dairy Compact to other bills, including the agricultural appropriations bill. It was a hard fought battle. I give credit to those who want to preserve the New England Dairy Compact for their willingness to continue and to fight for their cause. They thought they were going to have 60 votes. They thought they had the votes to force this on to the bill. They did not, frankly, come very close at all. As I recall, they came some seven votes short of the goal rather than one or two. 
   It was a decisive statement that made many in Wisconsin hope that finally, instead of just the politics of this, people would listen to the Secretary of Agriculture and realize this was not a good idea. We figured it was done. We knew we couldn't be sure because of what was done in 1996 in the conference committee. But we had hopes that this would not happen again. However, this is, unfortunately, now what is happening or what we fear could be happening. 
   In the conference committee, which I had a chance to observe last week for a while, there is a real possibility that the Secretary's reasonable recommendations to modify to some extent the milk marketing order systems and to discontinue the Northeastern Dairy Compact--those items may be reversed and placed in the agricultural appropriations bill even though there has been no vote in the Senate or in the House to continue the dairy compact. 
   Although I certainly regret having to come to the floor and proceed in this manner, I essentially have no choice. My farmers expect me to come to Washington and fight for their rights. It won fair and square on the floor. Yet somehow in conference committee these fair votes are taken away. Once again, as has been the case over and over again, dairy farmers in the upper Midwest are given the short end of the stick. It is only because these mistakes were made in terms of putting this compact together. Even the person who approved them, the Secretary of Agriculture, now sees it was not a very good idea and should be discontinued. 
   I say to the Senators whose bill is up--and it is an important piece of legislation--it is a matter of what is going on in the conference committee now that forces me to come to the floor and explain in more detail to my colleagues just what is at stake. I don't know how many times I will repeat this. I have already mentioned it. We had over 45,000 dairy farmers in Wisconsin around 1980. Only about 19 years later, we have fewer than 25,000. That is a huge loss not only of a way of life but of an economic base in our State. It is a tragedy for our State to have this trend continue. 
   Let me discuss a bit about the way the dairy industry is an integral part of our Nation's culture and history. We will look at that role. 
   Cheese, unlike its ancient cousin, yogurt, is not a novel food to Americans. It came over to America with the earliest settlers who made Cheddar cheese in their own homes. 
   Like yogurt, though, the popularity of cheese has been steadily growing. One of the most natural and oldest of food products, dating back to the domestication of animals, about 9000 B.C., cheese was once so highly esteemed it was even used as a medium of exchange. It traveled with Greeks, the Romans and with the armies of Genghis Khan. During the Middle Ages, monks in the French monasteries developed a soft-ripened cheese, starting a cheese renaissance. Centuries later, in 1851, Jesse Williams built the first commercial cheese factory in America. Herkimer, in upstate New York, grew into the cheese center of the United States until the westward expansion of the country resulted in Wisconsin gradually exceeding New York in total annual production. As pioneer wagons moved west, boats continued to carry others from across the ocean. The immigrants introduced their own favorite cheeses to America and contributed to the ``melting (cheese) pot.'' 
   As the number of cheeses available in the United States has enlarged, so has the consumer demand. The consumption of cheese in 1975 was 14.2 pounds per person compared to 9.1 pounds in 1965. 
   Natural cheese is a product of milk that has been heated, pressed, and cured. In the United States, cheese is made from pasteurized cow's milk.  While milk is generally used except for some varieties such as cottage cheese which uses skim milk. When milk is heated, usually with a starter of some kind, rennet or bacterial culture, it separates into soft curd and liquid whey. 
   After the milk has been heated, but before it has started to ripen, the soft curd may be separated from the whey and with some additional treatment made into a fresh natural unripened cheese. 
   Unripened cheeses contain relatively high moisture and do not undergo any curing or ripening. They are sold fresh and should be used within a few days after purchase. The gjetost and primost, however, because they contain very low moisture, may be kept refrigerated for several weeks or even months. 
   Cottage cheese, is low calorie cheese, is made in different sized curds. The small-curd type is usually used in salads because it holds its shape better than the larger curds which are suitable for all other purposes. To prepare creamed cottage cheese, fresh cream is mixed with the curd to give it additional moisture and flavor. 
   Cream cheese is of American origin and is one of our most popular soft cheeses. It is a mixture of milk and cream that is coagulated but unripened. 
   Unripened cheese may also be divided into soft or firm types. 
   Cream cheese and cottage cheese are examples of a soft unripened cheese. An example of firm unripened cheese is mozzarella. 
   To make natural ripened cheese, the soft curd is taken from the liquid whey and then cured by holding it at a certain temperature and humidity for a specified period of time. 
   Natural ripened cheeses may also be classified according to their degree of hardness. Authorities generally group natural cheese into four distinct groups of hardness: soft, semi-soft, firm, and very hard. Hardness has to do with moisture. The older the cheese, the lower its moisture content. 
   Brie and Camembert, both of which originated in France, are ripened by mold. The curd is not cut nor is it pressed. Cheese lovers all over the world hold these two cheeses in the highest of esteem. 
   Brie is considered to be the Queen of Cheeses. There are probably more literary references to Brie than to any other cheese. Its descriptions are often accompanied by superlatives but it is a difficult cheese to buy satisfactorily because it goes from under ripened to over ripened in a matter of a few days. 
   It is at its peak when it has a consistency of a heavy slow-pouring liquid and a yellow sheen. Under ripe Brie is flaky and chalky. Overripe Brie is very soft and has an off-order like ammonia. 
   Camembert is a popular cheese in France and is widely known in the United States. It has as devoted a following as Brie and also the same ephemeral quality of being ripe for only a very short time. 
   Limburger and Liederkranz are examples of bacteria-ripened cheeses. The different bacteria used in the ripening process are responsible for their characteristic flavor and odor. 
   Included in this category are the blue-veined cheeses. There are now over fifty varieties of blue cheeses made all over the world. However, the best known and most highly prized are Roquefort, Stiliton, and Gorgonzola. 
   Blue cheeses are called the ``king of cheeses.'' They are made from cow's milk. Roquefort is the exception. It is made from sheep's milk and is cured in the cool damp caves of southwestern France. 
   Bel Paese is a popular, all purpose cheese made in Italy and under license in the United States--Wisconsin, of course. It is a table cheese as well as cooking cheese. 
   Brick is an original American Cheese whose name derives from either the shape of the cheese or, perhaps, from the brick originally used in pressing the curd. It is softer than Cheddar and less sharp. It is a strong cheese, but not as strong as Limburger. 
   Muenster, as made in France where it is very popular, is strong cheese. It is used as table cheese. However, the American kind is much more bland and is suitable for cooking as well as for a table cheese. 
   Port du Salut originated in a Trappist monastery in France. The French import is usually mellow with a slight edge. 
   The hard or firm cheese list includes the two most popular cheeses in the United States, Cheddar and Swiss. 
   Cheddar cheese accounts for almost half of all the cheese consumed in America. It ranges from a very mild cheese to a very sharp one depending upon how long it's been aged. A versatile cheese, suitable for most cheese dishes, it melts well. 
   Canadian Cheddar is imported into the United States, but English Cheddar, by law, is not. The English relative to Cheddar, the famous Cheshire is imported. 
   More American Cheddar cheese is made in Wisconsin than any other state. There are variations to different kinds of cheese. Colby is primarily made in the Midwest while Monterey (Jack) and Tillamook is processed on the West Coast. Colby is not as compressed as the other cheddars and it has a higher moisture content. Monterey is also a milder cheddar and has a higher moisture content. There is a more aged Monterey called ``dry Monterey'' that can be used for grating. 
   A large amount of Cheddar cheese sold in the United States is sold as processed American cheese. 
   Provolone and Cacciocavalle are spun cheeses. The curd is placed in either hot water or hot whey and then stretched into its desired shape or size. They are an important ingredient in Italian cooking. The Provolone is usually smoked. 
   The Edam and Gouda cheeses are the most popular cheeses imported from the Netherlands. Similar in flavor, the Edam is made from partly skim milk and the Gouda from whole milk. 
   In the category of very hard cheeses, Parmesan has a mild to sharp piquant flavor and is famous as a seasoning in cooking. It has the natural ability of enhancing the flavor of foods. The imported Italian Parmesan is a highly prized cheese and is used as a table cheese as well as for seasoning. The domestic varieties are primarily grated for seasoning and for cooking. 
   Romano is a sharper cheese than Parmesan. In Italy it is usually made from sheep's milk instead of from cow's milk. It is primarily a grating cheese but the less sharp cheese may be used as a table cheese. The domestic variety is primarily a grating cheese. 
   Sap Sago is a grating cheese from Switzerland to which has been added dried clover. It is made by mixing whey and skim cow's milk. 
   I would like to say a little more about the process of making cheeses, butter, cream, and yogurt at home. 
   Although animals have been milked by man almost from the dawn of civilization, there are Egyptian paintings showing cattle being milked around 2000 B.C., the use of liquid milk was almost unknown until comparatively recently. 
   Until the beginning of the 17th century, milk drinking was considered quite injurious to health and, in view of the low standards of dairy hygiene, the incidence of cattle plague, and the fact that milk contained dangerous pathogenic factors, especially the germs of tuberculosis and typhoid, this was probably right at the time. 
   It reminds me of a dairy farmer who came to see me after I was elected to the Senate. I met him in the reception area outside the Chamber. He told me he was going over to some of the former Soviet Republics to try to help farmers there learn some of the skills we have in dairy farming. He told me his goal was to make sure that the milk in one of these former Soviet Republics could not walk to the market by itself. I understood what he was saying. If you do not do this right, as we do in America, in Wisconsin, then we have to be concerned. That is one of the reasons milk might have gotten off to sort of a slow start in some of these countries, given the risks. 
   The fact is, many children died of tuberculosis of bovine origin up until the late 19th century. It was not until the 1930s, when pasteurization and refrigeration of milk became accepted, and when concentrated efforts were inaugurated to eradicate the disease of bovine tuberculosis, that milk became safe and acceptable. I can tell you, growing up in Janesville, WI, we were taught about pasteurization as one of the most important events in human history. When you are from Wisconsin, that is a big deal, as it is almost anywhere.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his question. I note the presence of the senior Senator from Minnesota. Minnesota has fewer dairy farmers than Wisconsin, but it has a whole lot. Together, our two States comprise a tremendous percentage of dairy production in the country. We are adamant in this effort to try to stop what the Senator from Minnesota correctly points out is the same old trick. We won fair and square in 1997. There was not a vote in the House. They did not have a vote: should we have a New England Dairy Compact or not. 
   We did. It was a tough vote. 
   I tell you, this is a tough issue, a hard issue. One thing I like about it is that it is not about Republicans versus Democrats. It is one of those rare times when everyone in the body is open to be for something not based on their party but based on what is best for their area and what is best for the country. 
   So we had quite a debate. We all worked together on it. As I pointed out earlier, it was a close vote, but we won--I hope I am not given the wrong number--I think with roughly a 50-46 bipartisan vote where we voted not to have the compact. It went to conference. 
   I was in the State legislature in Wisconsin for 10 years. We had conference committees. They were often not the most attractive moments, of course, as things that go on in conference committees get a little rough. But there was a basic understanding that unless there was some basis from one house or the other for the outcome, it could not be done. 
   That is not what was done in this conference committee in 1996. Without any justification, this compact, or the permission to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to put the compact into effect, was placed in. And yes, I fear--although I hope it does not happen--that is exactly what is happening again. 
   There was an attempt here to force the compact continuation or extension on to the Ag appropriations bill. All three of us and Senator KOHL and others worked together and many other Senators from across the country, and they did not even come close to getting the 60 votes. 
   So that is my concern. That is why I am out here.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. To answer the excellent question of the Senator from Minnesota, this makes no sense. You and I have views on the Freedom to Farm Act. I strongly oppose it. I thought it was a bad idea. In fact, the results of it are shocking. 
   No one has been more eloquent about this than the senior Senator from Minnesota, who has pointed out the enormous tragedy that has occurred with many farmers around the country because of that law. 
   But what is bizarre about it, as you point out, is that in one area, instead of going the Freedom to Farm route, they voted to keep not just Government regulation but to put in place a system of regulation and marketing that only dealt with one small region of the country where there are only a few thousand dairy farmers, when there are some 25,000 in Wisconsin and a substantial number in Minnesota. It is a complete opposite of the notion of a free market national system. 
   Even for those of us who oppose the Freedom to Farm Act, those of us who oppose the Freedom to Farm Act are not proposing for wheat or corn or pork or beef or anything else that there be regional markets. Whatever philosophy you have, whether it be Government supports to guarantee our farmers do not fall below a certain level, or whether you believe in a complete freedom to farm or freedom to fail, some would say--either way--this idea of a regional market for a particular commodity is an example of ridiculous Federal interference. 
   We need a national dairy market. Upper Midwestern farmers will do fine in a national dairy market. But one that is unfairly skewed for one region, when the underlying system is already terribly unfair, is a double whammy that has cost us far too many lives and far too many livelihoods of farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota and throughout the upper Midwest.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.  
   I say no one has made it more his business to articulate what has happened to American farmers in general, particularly in the last few years. He was an inspiration to me in that regard before I got to this body. We are proud in Wisconsin, but not too proud to look west to Minnesota for that kind of inspiration at times. 
   Let me start with the second question. The first one involves, as you know, a lot of memories: 17 years of working with farmers. 
   But the second question really is always a hard one. People say to me: How can it be that you have a vote, fair and square, in the body in which you have been elected to serve, and there was no vote in the other House, and somehow this committee that is appointed to get together to resolve the differences between the Houses ends up coming up with the exact opposite of what the Senate had resolved? 
   You can say: Well, that's the way things always are. But that does not satisfy people. There are supposed to be some rules, both formal and informal, about the way business is done. It has always been my understanding, unless there is some basis in one House or the other for putting something into the conference committee, it should not be put in there. 
   It sounds like, as they say, inside baseball. But what it really is is a cynicism that what we do out here is irrelevant to what happens in the conference committee. 
   So I am sounding the alarm, as you suggested. I know people hate to lose. I hate to lose. I hated to lose when we won fair and square 2 years ago. I hated to lose when we begged the Secretary of Agriculture to not do this because we thought it was a lousy idea. He did not agree. Now he admits it is not a very good idea. 
   I think it is time for those on the other side to understand that sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. There are rules, there is fairness, and there is no fairness to this process when we win this vote time and again on the floor of the Senate, and somehow we are still stuck with this thing because of a few people in the conference committee. 
   I hope it does not happen, I say to the Senator from Minnesota, but I am worried about it. I certainly feel bad that I am compelled to do this in light of the wishes of the Senator from Maryland and people who are bringing this bill forward. It is a terribly important piece of legislation. We have to act on behalf of our dairy farmers and because of what has happened in the past. Because of the fact that fairness is not applied to our issue, we have no choice but to speak. 
   The reason I feel so strongly is that I have watched the decimation of Wisconsin's dairy farmers. I became a State senator in 1982, just 2 years after the year I like to mention as sort of the benchmark, when we had over 45,000 dairy farmers in Wisconsin. I grew up in a family and am old enough to remember, we didn't get our milk and our eggs at the store. The milk was delivered every morning by the milkman, and we got the eggs once a week by going out to farms in the area. That, to me, was the way it was done. We knew personally many of the family farmers in our area, and they were good friends of our family. It was part of our community. 
   There was no question in my mind, when I was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate, representing a largely rural area, that at the very top of my list had to be making sure these folks who had been providing food for us forever could continue to live. I would have been stunned and horrified to know that 17 years later I would be out here with about half of Wisconsin dairy farmers being lost. 
   I can trace it for the Senator from Minnesota, if he would like, through the hundreds of conversations I have had. I had them as a State senator, and I have had them as a U.S. Senator. I go to every 1 of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year and hold a town meeting. We open the door, and whoever wants to come to the town hall can come in. And in every 1 of Wisconsin's 72 counties, except for possibly Milwaukee, a farmer has come in or many farmers have come in and told me about the pressure on them because of this pricing system and, in the last couple of years, because of the overproduction that this New England Dairy Compact has caused. It varies. Sometimes they are just concerned. 
   But I say to the Senator from Minnesota, in the last 2 years I have had farmers I have known for 17 years, proud men and women, come to my town meetings and begin their presentation clearly, concisely, politely, but near the end of their presentation they have started to cry because they are sick and tired of not being able to pass on that farm to their kids. 
   That is not a very fun thing to watch--to watch a 70-year-old man who is still working his farm take the time to come to my town meeting and to try to say how he felt and to be unable to complete the presentation and to probably feel embarrassed, but it is that bad. 
   The hardest thing for me to hear is the farmer who says: I wanted my kids to go into farming, to go into dairy, but I cannot tell them it is a good idea. That is usually the point at which one of the farmers just can't go on. His dream, a lot of times the dream of his son or daughter, is actually to continue the family tradition, and they can't because the Federal Government is meddling in having a fair and open dairy market, the kind in which they would have done very well. 
   That is a brief answer, and I could go on and on.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I say to the Senator from Minnesota, that really is the fundamental question. It relates closely to what he has done such an excellent job of talking about. This isn't just about whether or not we are going to have a higher price for dairy farmers in New England or somewhat lower price in Wisconsin and the age-old regional battles. Something happens that is very dangerous to our democracy when we lose these small farms. We lose the ability to have people who own their own property produce our food. I think that is dangerous. 
   What is happening in every sector of the economy, especially in agriculture, is the consolidation of the control of the food supply into a few hands. I think the Senator from Minnesota knows the statistics better than I do, but I think in grain, I was told that one company is going to control something like 95 percent of the grain. 
   The Senator from Missouri, who was on the floor before, has made the point in meetings that we have a problem in this country when we go to the store and we buy some ham and we pay more for it than the farmer was getting for the whole pig for awhile. Somebody is making the money. It is not the small farmer. Dairy is only one example of this trend. 
   What happens is, when you lose these small farms in places like Minnesota and Wisconsin, of course, milk is still being produced, but it tends to be produced in these very large corporate operations, whether they are in Wisconsin, but more likely in other places.  I remember flying into a western State that I won't name and flying into an airport saying: What is that down there? It looked similar to the General Motors plant in Janesville. Somebody told me it was a dairy farm. 
   This isn't the dairy farming that I grew up to believe not only was basic to our economy but basic to our culture, basic to our democracy, and, yes, control of our own food supply. If big corporations and multinational corporations own our land and our food supply, isn't this even a question of national security? I think it is an element of national security if we own our own food product. The best way to keep owning it is to have small, individual producers all over this country continue to survive. 
   To me, I don't know if that is exactly what the Senator from Minnesota was getting at, but it is a fair point that this isn't just about the upper Midwest versus New England and so on. What it is really about is, can these small operators who live in Wisconsin and Minnesota continue to exist?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me say, because the Senator from Maryland has been very patient, I am sorry I had to delay this important legislation to this point. I am going to conclude for now. Again, I regret that this is necessary. However, as a Senator from the great State of Wisconsin, I will continue to fight for a fair national dairy policy as we await the outcome of the conference and in the days to follow. 
   Obviously, in taking this unusual step, I am merely signaling to the Senate that there certainly will be more discussions of the same kind if this goes forward. 
   Before I yield the floor, I see the Senator from Minnesota. I wonder if he wanted to ask me one more question.

It is not about any kind of legislation, some of which I might support. This is an attempt to prevent the continuation of an absurd distortion of our dairy market in the New England Dairy Compact. We are looking for fairness both in terms of the policy and the procedure of this institution. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. Again, I thank the Senator from Maryland for, I hope, understanding.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will say a few words about the cloture vote we will have shortly on the bankruptcy bill, S. 625. I understand many in this body want to pass bankruptcy legislation this year. Certainly, the credit card industry is eager for the Senate to act. I want to be able to vote for what I consider a balanced bankruptcy bill. 
   Hardball tactics of this kind will not move this body closer to that goal. By filing a cloture motion a few seconds after he brought up the bill, the majority leader is predetermining the outcome. Cloture, I am glad to say, will not be achieved this afternoon. Cloture should not be achieved until Senators have a chance to offer amendments to the bill. 
   Bankruptcy is, of course, a very complicated area of the law. We have not had real bankruptcy reform and change since 1978. It has an impact upon millions of American consumers and businesses. Unfortunately, S. 625 is a very one-sided piece of legislation. I have found an amazing virtual unanimity among all the experts on bankruptcy. Whether talking to academics or judges or trustees and even practitioners--of course you expect to hear this from debtors' attorneys but also from many creditors' attorneys--they all say this bill as it stands today should not pass. 
   The only way to make it work, the only way to improve it, is to amend it. However, many of the amendments we want to offer--and they are very much relevant to the bankruptcy issue--could not be offered if we invoke cloture today. 
   So I am hopeful and believe Democrats will vote today against cloture, to protect their right to offer bankruptcy amendments to this bankruptcy bill. 
   Let me also take a moment to remind my colleagues that this body passed a bankruptcy reform bill last year by a vote of 97 to 1. I voted for it. We had nearly a unanimous vote for a bill. That bill could have become law if the conference committee had not disregarded the wishes of the Senate. Let me just be clear, in response to the comments a few minutes ago of the Senator from Iowa, there is nothing fishy going on here. It is not as if the same bill that passed 97 to 1 is before us. It is very much the opposite. This is the hard nosed, one-sided legislation that in my mind is the fantasy of the other body in this institution. It is not the bill I was comfortable voting for and was pleased to vote for last year. 
   This bill is not the balanced approach that the Senate came up with last year. So amendments, many amendments, frankly, are needed. The way to reduce the number of amendments is to accept some of them. Many of the amendments I and my colleagues are going to offer on this bill are reasonable, moderate, and widely supported. They will make this a more fair and balanced piece of legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on cloture. And even more, I urge the majority leader and the proponents of this  bill to simply face the honest policy disagreements that need to be resolved either through amendments or through negotiations. Strong-arm tactics like filing for cloture right off the bat on a bill of this magnitude and complexity are not going to work. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I sought a few minutes ago to get unanimous consent to have the Senate pass the East Timor Self-Determination Act of 1999, and I am extremely pleased with the support we received from both sides of the aisle on it. Apparently, there was some objection to taking this step by unanimous consent today. Time is clearly of the essence with regard to this very important legislation, in light of the situation in East Timor. We must send a strong statement from the Senate. We have to send a clear message to Jakarta that the Government of Indonesia must live up to its commitment to the people of East Timor. So I will again seek, along with Senator REED, Senator HARKIN, Senator LEAHY and others, early next week when we come back, to have this passed. 
   I especially thank the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, for their longstanding commitment to realize self-determination for people of East Timor. I especially thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and the chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Mr. THOMAS and Mr. KERRY, for their work to ensure swift passage of this important legislation by the Senate. 
   I reiterate, the chairman, Senator HELMS, has been enormously helpful in getting this bill through the committee, discharged from committee, and out to the Senate floor. This legislation is crucial to maintaining pressure on the Indonesian Government to live up to the obligations it has made to the people of East Timor and to the international community, including its commitment to admit and cooperate with an international peacekeeping force in East Timor. The bill suspends all military and most economic assistance to the Government of Indonesia, including assistance still in the pipeline, until the President determines the Government of Indonesia is cooperating with the efforts by the international community to establish a safe and secure environment in East Timor and is taking a series of specific, significant steps to that end. 
   I also take this moment to applaud the U.N. Security Council on its passage of a resolution authorizing the deployment of a multinational force to  East Timor, and to commend the nation of Australia and other countries in the region that have agreed to provide troops for that force. 
   I reiterate what I believe are the next crucial steps that have to be taken so the people of East Timor can finally realize the independence they so clearly on August 30 expressed a desire to have. 
   The international peacekeeping force must be deployed as rapidly as possible. We must quickly and concisely define the scope of a limited U.S. role in the peacekeeping mission. The international community must keep pressure on Indonesia, pressure that will be brought to bear by this legislation. The peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, and war crimes investigators must be allowed full access to East Timor. 
   Again, it is my hope this will be taken up quickly next week.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution on fuel economy standards. This resolution has been controversial in my state, and I believe its effect on automobile fuel economy standards has been misunderstood by some. I want to make my position clear: though I will vote in favor of this resolution, I have reservations about some of the language it contains, reservations I made known to the amendment sponsors. 
   My vote today is about Congress getting out of the way and letting a federal agency meet the requirements of federal law originally imposed by Congress. I will support this resolution because I am concerned that Congress has for 5 years now blocked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, part of the Federal Department of Transportation, from meeting its legal duty to evaluate whether there is a need to modify fuel economy standards by legislative rider since Fiscal Year 1996. The resolution simply says the Senate should not recede to Section 320 of the House bill. 
   I believe that the outcome of any assessment of fuel economy standards needs should not be pre-judged. I am concerned that the wording of this resolution needlessly fails to be fully neutral. It tips too far toward saying that the result of an assessment should be a quote increase unquote in fuel economy standards. I have made no determination about what fuel economy standards should be. NHTSA is not required under the law to increase fuel economy standards, but it is required to examine on a regular basis whether there is a need for changes to fuel economy standards. NHTSA has the authority to set new standards for a given model year taking into account several factors: technological feasibility, economic practicability, other vehicle standards such as those for safety and environmental performance, and the need to conserve energy. I want NHTSA to fully and fairly evaluate all the criteria, and then make an objective recommendation on the basis of those facts. I will expect them to do that, and I will respect their judgement. After NHTSA makes a recommendation, if it does so, I will then consult with all interested parties--unions, environmental interests, auto manufacturers, and other interested Wisconsin citizens about their perspectives on NHTSA's recommendation. 
   However, just as the outcome of NHTSA's assessment should not be pre-judged, the language of the House rider certainly should not have so blatantly pre-judged and precluded any new objective assessment of fuel economy standards. Section 320 of the House bill states:  
   None of the funds in this Act shall be available to prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulations pursuant to title V of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (49 U.S.C. 32901 et seq.) prescribing corporate average fuel economy standards for automobiles, as defined in such title, in any model year that differs from standards promulgated for such automobiles prior to enactment of this section.  
   The House language effectively prevents NHTSA from collecting any information about the impact of changing the fuel economy standards in any way. Under the House language, not only would NHTSA be prohibited from collecting information or developing standards to raise fuel economy standards, it couldn't collect information or develop standards to lower them either. The House language assumes that NHTSA has a particular agenda, that NHTSA will recommend standards which can't be achieved without serious impacts, and uses an appropriations bill to circumvent the law's requirements to evaluate fuel efficiency and maintain the current standards again for another fiscal year. I cannot support retaining this rider in the law at this time. 
   The NHTSA should be allowed freely to provide Congress with information about whether fuel efficiency improvements are possible and advisable. Congress needs to understand whether or not improvements in fuel economy can and should be made using existing technologies. Congress should also know which emerging technologies may have the potential to improve fuel economy. Congress also needs to know that if improvements are technically feasible, what is the appropriate time frame in which to make such changes in order to avoid harm to our auto sector employment. I don't believe that Congress should confuse our role as policymakers with our obligation to appropriate funds. Changes in fuel economy standards could have a variety of consequences. I seek to understand those consequences and to balance the concerns of those interested in seeing improvements to fuel economy as a means of reducing gasoline consumption and associated pollution. 
   I deeply respect the views of those who are concerned that a change in fuel economy would threaten the economic prosperity of Wisconsin's automobile industry. Earlier this year I visited Daimler Chrysler's Kenosha Engine plant and I met with union representatives from the Janesville GM plant. In those meetings I heard significant concerns that a sharp increase in fuel economy standards, implemented in the very near term, will have serious consequences. I want to avoid consequences that will unduly burden Wisconsin workers and their employers. In the end, I would like to see that Wisconsin consumers have a wide range of new automobiles, SUVs, and trucks available to them that are as fuel efficient as can be achieved while balancing energy concerns with technological and economic impacts. That balancing is required by the law. At its core this resolution does not disturb that balance, but I wish the language had been more neutral, so that all concerned could be more confident that the process is neutral. In that spirit, I fully expect NHTSA to proceed with the intent to fully consider all those factors. 
   In supporting this resolution, I take the position that the agency responsible for collecting information about fuel economy be allowed to do its job, in order to help me do my job. I expect them to be fair and neutral in that process and I will work with interested Wisconsinites to ensure that their views are represented and the regulatory process proceeds in a fair and reasonable manner toward whatever conclusions the merits will support.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during this discussion of the Transportation appropriations bill, I've been reminded of a piece of Senate history--the push to break the railroad companies' iron grip on railroad rates by setting up the Interstate Commerce Commission. It was a fierce battle that pitted the public's interest against the economic and political might of the railroads, a clash that was ultimately won by those favoring regulation, resulting in the passage of the Hepburn Act in 1906. 
   One powerful voice for consumer interests in those days belonged to Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr., of my home state of Wisconsin, one of the greatest Senators ever to hold the office. It's fitting that his portrait now hangs in the Senate Reception Room outside of this chamber along with four other legendary Senators--Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Robert Taft. 
   A fearless champion of the American people in the face of the powerful influence of special interests, La Follette did not hesitate to speak out against the railroad companies. In fact, he did so during his first speech in the U.S. Senate in April of 1906, when La Follette broke the unwritten rule that freshman Senators did not make floor speeches. 
   And La Follette didn't just make any floor speech--he delivered an oration that lasted several days and covered 148 pages in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
   During those remarks, La Follette addressed the power of the railroad monopolies and declared:  
   At no time in the history of any nation has it been so difficult to withstand these forces as it is right here in America today. Their power is acknowledged in every community and manifest in every lawmaking body.  
   La Follette's battle with the railroad industry came to a head in the summer of 1906, when he embarked on a speaking tour around the country. When visiting the states of his colleagues, he took the unprecedented step of reading the roll call, name by name, of votes on amendments he had proposed earlier that year to make railroad regulation more responsive to consumer interests. This ``Calling of the Roll'' became a trademark of La Follette's speeches, and its effect on his audiences was powerful. When these constituents discovered that their representatives were voting against their interests as consumers and in favor of the railroads, they were outraged. According to the New York Times,  
   The devastation created by La Follette last summer and in the early fall was much greater than had been supposed. He carried senatorial discourtesy so far that he has actually imperiled the reelection of some of the gentlemen who hazed him last winter.  
   In 1906, La Follette Called the Roll on amendments affecting the railroad industry, and today, in the spirit of that effort, I'd like to Call the Bankroll on the railroad industry, which today is composed of a handful of companies that monopolize the various regions of the U.S. rail system. 
   In 1906, Congress saw the need to regulate the railroad monopoly. Today, rapid consolidation in the industry has left us with four Class I railroads, two in the East and two in the West. This merger mania has resulted in reduced competition and another virtual monopoly for the railroad companies. For rail customers and consumers today, this is sure to lead to higher costs and less attention to providing good service, just as it did at the turn of the century. But the railroad companies are resisting any change, and backing up their point of view with almost $4 million dollars in PAC and soft money contributions in the last election cycle alone. 
   During 1997 and 1998, the four Class I railroads gave the following to political parties and candidates:

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an aspect of the Transportation appropriations bill that I think deserves mention during this debate. It's a factor that influences legislative debate, but one that we consistently sidestep in our discussions on this floor--money in politics. 
   Well, Mr. President, I'm trying to change that with what I call the Calling of the Bankroll. When I Call the Bankroll on this floor, I describe how much money the various interests that lobby us on a particular bill have spent on campaign contributions to influence our decisions here in this chamber. I have already Called the Bankroll on several bills; for instance, when I discussed the contributions of the high tech industry and the trial lawyers during debate on the Y2K bill, and, more recently, when I pointed out the contributions of the managed care companies and the pharmaceutical industry, among others, during the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   And now, we come to the fiscal year 2000 Transportation appropriations bill, as it relates to the airline industry, which has been battling against another bill of rights. While in June the airline industry unveiled its own Passengers' Bill of Rights, it falls far short of what was outlined in other pending Senate legislation, including the Airline Passenger Fairness Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Senator WYDEN, for his leadership on this issue, and his commitment to giving airline passengers across the country a real bill of rights. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of both amendments offered by my friend from Oregon. 
   The Airline Passenger Fairness Act establishes a national policy to provide consumers with a basic expectation of fair treatment by airlines and to encourage airlines to provide better customer service by outlining minimum standards. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act would ensure that passengers have the information that they need to make informed choices in their air travel plans. 
   But, Mr. President, there is a serious obstacle facing supporters of a comprehensive Passengers' Bill of Rights--the PAC and soft money contributions of the airline industry. 
   The six largest airlines in the United States--American, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United and US Airways--and their lobbying association, the Air Transport Association of America, gave a total of more than $2 million dollars in soft money and more than $1 million dollars in PAC money in the last election cycle alone. 
   Northwest was the largest soft money giver among these donors, giving well over half a million dollars to the political parties in 1997 and 1998. Mr. President, you may remember that Northwest Airlines made headlines across the country earlier this year when they left thousands of passengers stranded on snow-clogged runways in Detroit, leaving some of their customers without food, water or working toilets for more than eight hours. 
   Mr. President, according to the Department of Transportation, consumer complaints about air travel shot up by more than 25 percent last year. Those complaints run the gamut from erratic and unfair ticket pricing; being sold a ticket on already oversold flights; lost luggage; and flight delays, changes, and cancellations. 
   We can and should address these problems, Mr. President. The American people are demanding change; as legislators, we should respond. 
   But we have yet to do anything concrete in this Congress to guarantee airline passengers the rights they deserve. 
   The American people can't help wondering why, Mr. President, so today I offer this campaign finance information to my colleagues and the public to help to present a clearer picture of the influences surrounding this aspect of the Transportation appropriations bill, and the influence of those with a stake in the debate on a comprehensive Passengers' Bill of Rights. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the tumultuous events that have unfolded in East Timor since the August 30 ballot to determine the territory's political future, and to state clearly what the United States is and should be doing in response to this crisis. 
   How can anyone not be horrified at the blind eye that the Indonesian government has turned to the unchecked violence and mass murder being perpetrated in East Timor by anti-independence militias--violence that even today is blatantly supported by elements of the Indonesian army. 
   In just one week, since the ballot's results were announced on September 4, the militias have driven out or slaughtered nearly the entire population of the capital city of Dili. East Timor is dotted with villages and cities that have become virtual ghost towns in a matter of days. Many of the people that have been driven out have been  forced into militia-run refugee camps in West Timor. Mr. President, these innocent civilians are unprotected targets for a group of thugs who are willing to obliterate East Timor completely rather than allow it to start down the road to the independence more than 78 percent of its people voted for on August 30. 
   The message of the militias is clear: if Indonesia can't have East Timor, there will be no East Timor worth having for the East Timorese. 
   Cities are in flames and militia members are stealing anything of value that they have not destroyed. Churches, usually recognized as places of sanctuary--even by combatants during war--have been burned with refugees still inside. Mr. President, this is literally a scorched earth policy. It is like few of even the worst episodes we have seen in the often bloody 20th century. 
   No segment of the pro-independence population in East Timor has escaped the wrath of the militias. Religious leaders, foreigners, and the families of activists have been especially targeted for summary execution. At least 20 priests and nuns across East Timor have been murdered. Three of the priests were among approximately 100 Timorese victims killed in a brutal grenade attack on the town of Suai. Women, children, and the elderly have been massacred. Members of the United Nations Assistance Mission to East Timor (UNAMET) have been targeted, as have foreign journalists who are trying to cover the atrocities. 
   The leaders of the Timorese independence movement and their families are especially vulnerable to attack. Early last week, the Indonesian government released independence leader and political prisoner Xanana Gusmao from jail in Jakarta. On Friday, he learned that his 82-year-old father had likely been murdered by pro-Jakarta thugs, and that his elderly mother is missing. 
   Last week, the United Nations evacuated most of its personnel to Australia. About 80 brave UNAMET personnel elected to stay in East Timor to try to protect the approximately 1300 East Timorese who remained huddled behind the compound's barbed wire fences. They remained barricaded in what was left of the UNAMET headquarters for about a week with little, if any, power, water, or working telecommunications lines. Militia members have repeatedly fired into the compound. 
   On Friday, some of the Timorese, including women and children, desperate to escape the violence, climbed the razor-sharp fence separating them from the armed thugs and attempted to find refuge in the hills behind the UNAMET mission. They were fired on by the militias as they tried to escape. The unarmed UNAMET personnel were powerless to help and could only watch in horror as those they had come to help were shot down by ruthless opponents of justice, self-determination, and the rule of law. Yesterday, the U.N. evacuated most of its personnel and the refugees remained in the compound to Australia. 
   The boldness of the militias, and the complicity of the Indonesian army, and apparently members of the Habibie government, is astounding. I am truly shocked by the total impotence or inaction of the Indonesian government over the last two weeks. President Habibie promised the United Nations, the international community, and--most importantly--the people of East Timor, that he would ensure a secure environment in the territory and that the wishes of the Indonesian people would be respected. Neither has happened. 
   Some argue that Habibie may be unable to stop the violence. Others say he is unwilling. His level of control over the army, which he did not consult prior to agreeing to the U.N.-supervised ballot on the future of East Timor, is, of course, a subject of a lot of debate. Whatever the case, Habibie has not made any compelling strong statements condemning this violence, and has made no attempt to reign in the army personnel who are participating in this rampage. 
   I am also disturbed by the inaction of the head of the Indonesian military, General Wiranto. This past weekend, Wiranto implied that he may not have control of all of his forces. On Saturday, he accompanied a delegation from the United Nations Security Council to Dili, and he saw for what he said was the first time the devastation in that city. Soon after this visit, he said he would recommend that President Habibie accept an international peacekeeping force. 
   Finally, under considerable pressure from the international community, and with the support of General Wiranto and the head of the Indonesian police, Habibie announced early Sunday that his government would allow international peacekeepers, led by Australia, to come to East Timor to restore order and stop the violent rampage of the militias. But, as is often the case in clashes such as this, his announcement, while welcome, came too late for those Timorese murdered by the militias and those hiding in the hills who have been forever scarred by the violence and impoverished by the destruction that has been leveled against the democratic aspirations of the people of East Timor. 
   Now that the international community has reached this critical point in the transition of the political future of East Timor, Mr. President, here, I think, are the steps that must be taken next. 
   First and foremost, the international peacekeeping force must be deployed at the earliest possible date. I am very concerned at the words of delay coming out of Jakarta this morning. 
   I deeply regret that it took President Habibie so long to recognize the need for international assistance. Now, the Indonesian government, military, and President Habibie must cooperate fully with the deployment and must not interfere in the operations of this peacekeeping force. They must allow the force to deploy quickly, restore order, and help the East Timorese people to regain a semblance of security in their own homes and some hope of actually realizing the aspirations manifest in the results of the August 30 ballot. 
   I understand that Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas continues meeting in New York today along with officials from Australia, to discuss the details of the Security Council mandate for the peacekeeping mission. One of those details clearly is to determine the composition of this international force and the role of the Indonesians themselves in such a deployment. Another should be to lay the groundwork for investigations into the crimes that have taken place in East Timor, including procedures to begin to collect evidence for future prosecutions. 
   Nobel laureates Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Carlos Belo have called for the immediate formation of a war crimes tribunal to investigate and prosecute those responsible for these vicious crimes. That tribunal should be formed at the earliest possible date. To achieve that goal, the immediate priority of the international community should be to get the peacekeeping forces deployed to gain control of the situation and prevent any further bloodshed, and to allow the Timorese that have fled to return home. 
   The mandate for the peacekeeping mission should also be clear about the rules of engagement for disarming and detaining members of the militias. Some militia leaders have said that they will not disarm. This volatile situation poses a grave risk to the peacekeepers, and must be dealt with carefully and expeditiously. 
   Second, we must quickly and concisely define the scope of the U.S. role in this peacekeeping mission. I am pleased that Australia has come forward to take the lead on this peacekeeping mission in East Timor, and that other countries in the region have offered to contribute troops to this effort. It is my general belief that peacekeeping operations should be led by countries in the region where the conflict is occurring. I am also troubled by some word this morning that the Indonesian government is perhaps balking at the idea of Australia leading this mission--which I think is very appropriate, that Australia do so. 
   The militia-led violence, and the blatant collusion of the Indonesian military in the commission of that violence, is a direct slap at rule of law and the protection for the right to self-determination in international law and supported by the United Nations. I hope that any participation by the Indonesian military in this peacekeeping force will be scrutinized. Those who helped perpetrate the violence must not be placed in positions of trust within this operation.  
   I will say more about my views with respect to U.S. involvement in this peacekeeping operation in a few minute. 
   Third, the international community must keep the pressure on the Indonesian government. I am pleased that the President of our country made a decision I have advocated for some time to suspend military-to-military activities with Indonesia. I am also encouraged that this decision includes halting all new military sales to that country. I hope that the President will expand this decision to immediately halt any sales currently in the pipeline. If we are to be taken seriously by the Indonesian government, those sales must also be included. And these benefits should not be reinstated until specific steps have been taken to implement the results of the August 30 ballot. 
   I have heard many observers argue that Indonesia is too important financially to the United States and other countries to risk angering Jakarta. I would argue that no amount of trade is worth East Timorese lives. If we truly are to support Indonesia in its transition to true democracy, we must insist that the violence stop, and we must use every cent of our economic leverage to do so. 
   Last week I introduced a bill, S. 1568, that would suspend all military and most economic assistance to Indonesia until steps have been taken to implement the August 30 ballot. I am pleased that the Administration has suspended some military aid. It is now imperative that we keep the pressure on by refusing to reinstate that aid--and by threatening to suspend all other aid--until the results of the August 30 ballot are implemented. My 
   bill would suspend new assistance and sales as well as those loans and purchases currently in the pipeline. In order to be effective, we must stop all aid in its tracks, not just new aid. We should also call on our allies to do the same. The recent financial troubles in Asia have made Indonesia dependent on bilateral and multilateral assistance. We should use that dependence as leverage to ensure that the Indonesian government lives up to its commitments in East Timor, including its newly announced willingness to admit a peacekeeping force into East Timor. 
   In that regard, I am pleased that the European Union yesterday announced that it has suspended all arms sales and military cooperation with Indonesia. 
   That welcome development makes it all the more important that we continue to push for passage of our legislation to suspend assistance. We must continue to apply the financial pressure provided for in this bill so that the Indonesians will understand the continuing U.S. resolve to see justice done in East Timor. 
   Finally, the United Nations mandate for this peacekeeping mission should include full access to East Timor for peacekeeping troops, humanitarian workers, and war crimes investigators. The anti-independence movement cannot be allowed to block access to any part of East Timor. In addition, humanitarian workers should also be allowed full access to the refugee camps in West Timor. The nations of the international peacekeeping force must make clear that no such interference will be tolerated. 
   People are dying. Women and children are being slaughtered while the politicians try to leverage the situation to their advantage. President Habibie has a chance to do what is right for his people, and the East Timorese people, before he leaves office. The way to salvage what is left of Indonesia's shredded international reputation is to allow international peacekeepers to deploy rapidly into East Timor to stop this senseless bloodshed. 
   Let me say another word about the U.S. role in this peacekeeping mission. As many of my colleagues know, I have been a vocal opponent of U.S. deployments to such places as Bosnia and Kosovo. While I support the concept of an international peacekeeping force led by countries from the region, it is my strong preference as it was in those cases that U.S. troops on the ground in East Timor not be a significant part of this peacekeeping mission. Our troops are currently overextended in open-ended commitments in such places as Bosnia, Kosovo, and Saudi Arabia. We should do whatever we can to limit our involvement in these places and be very hesitant to get deeply involved in any new missions of this sort. 
   That said, however, I am open to supporting a request to the Congress from the Administration for U.S. financial, diplomatic, communications, and logistical support for an international peacekeeping mission to East Timor that is led by countries in the region. The Administration must continue to consult closely with the Congress prior to making any commitment to assist with such a peacekeeping mission. 
   I believe strongly that the United States must develop criteria for deciding whether and where and how deeply to get involved in peacekeeping missions abroad. Our men and women in uniform and their families deserve to understand the dangers of proposed missions and to be given a good-faith estimate of their length. 
   As my colleagues know, I oppose our continuing involvement in the Balkans. The Administration argued that our action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was necessary for humanitarian reasons. The trouble I have with our operations in Kosovo is that we have not shown the same willingness to intervene outside of our hemisphere to places like Rwanda and East Timor. What constitutes a humanitarian tragedy that warrants involvement by the United States military? The answer to that questions seems to change frequently under the current policy. I am affraid we really have no policy framework to address this crucial question. But the question will continue to arise and will do so with increasing frequency. 
   In my view, the legal case for international intervention in East Timor is more compelling than the situation in Kosovo because of the long-standing legal disputes over the political status of the territory, as well as the clear expression for self-determination by the people of East Timor on August 30. The people of East Timor cast their votes in a ballot sanctioned by the Indonesian government and supervised by the United Nations. 
   The East Timorese were promised a secure environment in which to express their honest views about the political future of their homeland. Instead, they had to endure intimidation by armed thugs supported by the army and by elements of the government that had sworn to protect them and to respect their wishes. Yet miraculously almost 99 percent of registered voters went to the polls, bringing along their courage and a commitment to freedom. And then when the militias began a murderous rampage, the government did nothing. They would not grant the international community the power to act. 
   So again, Mr. President, let me reiterate my view of the next crucial steps that must be taken in East Timor. 
   An international peacekeeping force must be deployed as rapidly as possible. 
   We must quickly and concisely define the scope of a limited U.S. role in the peacekeeping mission. 
   The international community must keep the pressure on the Indonesian government, and the peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, and war crimes investigators must be allowed full access to East Timor. And it all must happen as soon as possible. Thousands of lives and the legitimate hopes of a people hang in the balance.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues Senator CONRAD and Senator CHAFEE to introduce the Fairness in Medicare Home Health Access Act of 1999 to address some serious access problems in the Medicare home health care program. Our bill contains provisions to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for home health services have real access to those services. 
   Mr. President, I have been working to promote the availability of home care and other long-term care options for my entire public life because I believe strongly in the importance of enabling people to stay in their own homes. For seniors who are homebound and have skilled nursing needs, having access to home health services through the Medicare program is the difference between staying in their own home and moving into a nursing home. The availability of home health services is integral to preserving independence, dignity and hope for many beneficiaries. I feel strongly that where there is a choice, we should do our best to allow patients to choose home health care. I think seniors need and deserve that choice. 
   Mr. President, as you know, and as many of our colleagues know, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained significant changes to the way that Medicare pays for home health services. Perhaps the most significant change was a switch from cost-based reimbursement to an Interim Payment System, or IPS. IPS was intended as a cost-saving transitional payment system to tide us over until the development and implementation of a Prospective Payment System or PPS, for home health payments under Medicare. Unfortunately, the cuts went deeper than anyone--including CBO forecasters--anticipated, leaving many Medicare beneficiaries without access to the services they need. 
   The IPS is based on past spending: agencies are paid the lowest of three measures: (1) actual costs; (2) a per visit limit of 105% of the national median; or (3) a per beneficiary annual limit, derived from a blend of 75% of an agency's costs and 25% regional costs. 
   These formulas get pretty technical, Mr. President, and I won't go into too much detail about them. What is important is that the net effect of the Interim Payment System is that since IPS pays agencies the lowest of the three measures, agencies in areas where costs are historically low will be disproportionately and unfairly affected. In effect, they are penalized for having kept their costs low in the past. 
   And, Mr. President, Wisconsin's Medicare home health spending has been very, very low, even before the advent of IPS. The 1999 edition of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care described the variation in Medicare home health reimbursements as ``extreme'': in 1996, the national average Medicare home health expenditure per-enrollee was $532.00, but the maximum and minimum ranged from a high of $3,090 in McAllen, Texas, to an unbelievable $81 in Appleton, Wisconsin, in my home state. Even the area of Wisconsin with the highest reimbursements is only at $267 per beneficiary, about half of the national average. When you consider that these figures are adjusted for age, sex, race, illness and price of services, the variation is truly astounding. Pegging reimbursement to past spending, as IPS does, simply 
   magnifies the existing payment inequalities. 
   Mr. President, in Wisconsin, 29 Medicare home health providers have shut down since the implementation of IPS. Still more have shrunken their service areas, stopped accepting Medicare, or cannot accept assignment for high cost patients because the payments are simply too low. 
   So, what do these changes mean for Medicare beneficiaries? Well, quite  frankly, in many parts of Wisconsin, the changes mean the beneficiaries in certain areas or with certain diagnoses simply don't have access to home health care. The IPS has created disincentives to treat patients with expensive medical diagnoses. Few agencies, if any, can afford to care for them. 
   Mr. President, I think that a letter I received from my constituents at the Douglas County Health Department does a great job of illustrating just how bad the access problem is, particularly in rural areas. The Douglas County Health Department operates a home health program in Superior, Wisconsin, in the northwestern corner of my state. According to their letter, as a result of IPS, the program will lose approximately $590,000. Let me read my colleagues a passage from their letter: ``The Douglas County Home Care [program] serves ..... about 400 residents a year, [of which] 82% [are] Medicare covered ..... 33% of our patients live in rural areas not covered by other home care providers. There are four other providers in our area. All have discontinued taking Medicare patients and/or have stopped serving rural patients due to the high cost and low reimbursement.'' 
   The legislation we are introducing today contains several important provisions to enable elderly and disabled homebound individuals to remain in their homes. The bill ensures by statute that by 15% across-the-board cut for all home health providers cannot happen during the Interim Payment System and that it will only be 10% for the first three years of PPS. The bill also makes special provisions for medically complex patients who have more expensive health care needs, and raises the per visit limits to enable home care agencies to continue serving patients in rural areas, where travel times are longer. I think these two provisions are particularly significant because the present IPS does not adequately account for the care needs of homebound individuals in rural areas, and the absence of home care options essentially forces these individuals into nursing homes or hospitals. 
   The bill provides some administrative relief from the 15 minute increment reporting rule and asks HCFA to reexamine whether the cost associated with the collection of data is worthwhile in terms of what those data may yield. Finally, the bill expresses the sense of the Senate that HCFA should ensure that fiscal intermediaries receive and convey accurate and consistent information to agencies. 
   These provisions all need to be in place in order to ensure that we do not punish the most efficient and well-performing agencies as we seek to streamline and modernize the program. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I voted in favor of BBA '97 because I believed it contained meaningful provisions to balance the budget. I want to emphasize that the goal was to balance 
   the budget--it was not to punish home health agencies, and certainly not to deny Medicare beneficiaries access to the home health services they need. 
   I believe we ought to take a serious look at what refinements and fine tuning need to occur to ensure that our homebound elderly and disabled constituents--among the frailest and most vulnerable of our people we serve--can receive the services they need. 
   Without that fine-tuning, I am quite certain that more home health agencies in Wisconsin and in other areas across our country will close, leaving some of our frailest Medicare beneficiaries without the choice to receive care at home. Again, I think Seniors need and deserve that choice, and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964, which was signed into law on September 3, 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, and to announce the formation of a Senate Wilderness and Public Lands Caucus. The Wilderness Act became law seven years after the first wilderness bill was introduced by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. The final bill, sponsored by Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, passed the Senate by a vote of 73-12 on April 9, 1963, and passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 373-1 on July 30, 1964. The Wilderness Act of 1964 established a National Wilderness Preservation System ``to secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.'' 
   The law reserves to Congress the authority to designate wilderness areas, and directs the federal land management agencies to review the lands under their responsibility for their wilderness potential. 
   The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest Service land in 54 wilderness areas. Now, after passage of 102 pieces of legislation the wilderness system is comprised of over 104 million acres in 625 wilderness areas, across 44 States, and administered by four federal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service in the Department of the Interior.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Senator from California this because I share her strong opposition to this amendment, which would allow oil companies to continue to underpay the U.S. Government in royalties for drilling on public lands. It is my understanding this rider was modified by the managers' amendment. But, as originally drafted, the rider blocks the implementation of new Interior rules to stop these underpayments, just as their implementation was blocked in the last Congress; is that correct?

   She may be aware that from time to time I do something that I call ``calling of the bankroll''--interest in companies that contribute large sums of  money in terms of campaign contributions. 
   I am wondering if the Senator is aware that during the 1997-1998 election cycle oil companies gave the following in political donations to the parties and to Federal candidates: 
   Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in PAC money. 
   Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than $330,000 in PAC money. 
   I wonder if the Senator is aware that Atlantic-Richfield gave more than $525,000 in soft money and $150,000 in PAC money.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I finally ask the Senator to make the comparison between the list that she just read. By and large these are very important groups that represent the average people of this country. There is no way four of them could get together and give $2.9 million as these four corporations I just described did. Obviously these four corporations want this rider to be a part of the Interior appropriations bill. It is the powerful political donors. They may well get their way despite the credibility of groups and interests that the Senator just indicated. 
   I, again, very much thank the Senator from California for her leadership on this. 
   I rise today to share my concern about the number and content of legislative riders to address environmental matters contained in the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations Bill. I hope that all provisions which adversely effect the implementation of environmental law, or change federal environmental policy, will be removed from this legislation when it returns to the floor. 
   I believe that the Senate should not include provisions in spending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially environmentally beneficial regulations from being promulgated by the federal agencies that enforce federal environmental law. 
   I want to note, before I describe my concerns in detail, that this is not the first time that I have expressed concerns regarding legislative riders in appropriations legislation that would have a negative impact on our nation's environment. 
   For more than two decades, we have seen a remarkable bipartisan consensus to protect the environment through effective environmental legislation and regulation. I believe we have a responsibility to the American people to protect the quality of our public lands and resources. That responsibility requires the Senate to express its strong distaste for legislative efforts to include proposals in spending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially beneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated or enforced by the federal agencies that carry out federal law. 
   The people of Wisconsin have caught on to what's happening here. They continue to express their grave concern that, when riders are placed in spending bills, major decisions regarding environmental protection are being made without the benefit of an up or down vote. 
   Wisconsinites have a very strong belief that Congress has a responsibility to discuss and publicly debate matters effecting the environment. We should be on record with regard to our position on this matter of open government and environmental stewardship. 
   I have particular concerns regarding several riders contained in this bill. I will site three examples of provisions of concern to me. I am concerned that we failed to strip the rider on the mining millsite issue. This is the second rider of this type we have considered. In Section 3006 of Public Law 106-31, the 1999 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, Congress exempted the Crown Jewel project in Washington State from the Solicitor's Opinion. This rider, in contrast to the previous rider, applies to all mines on public lands. 
   I am also concerned that we have chosen to again include a grazing policy rider as well. It requires the Bureau of Land Management to renew expiring grazing permits under the same terms and conditions contained in the old permit. This automatic 
   renewal will remain in effect until such time as the Bureau complies with ``all applicable laws.'' There is no schedule imposed on the Agency, therefore necessary environmental improvements to the grazing program could be postponed indefinitely. This rider affects millions of acres of public rangelands that support endangered species, wildlife, recreation, and cultural resources. The rider's impact goes far beyond the language contained in the FY 1999 appropriations bill, in which Congress allowed a short-term extension of grazing permits which expired during the current fiscal year. As written, this section undercuts the application of environmental law, derails administrative appeals, and hampers application of the conservation-oriented grazing Guidelines. 
   I also want to voice my opposition to the amendment that would allow oil companies to continue to underpay the U.S. government in royalties for drilling on public lands. I understand that this rider was modified by the manager's amendment, but as originally drafted the rider blocks the implementation of new Interior Department rules to stop these underpayments, just as their implementation was blocked in the last Congress. 
   This is a huge windfall for the oil companies--and as it is with so many special interest provisions that find their way into our legislation, to the wealthy donors go the spoils, while the taxpayers get the shaft. The Interior Department estimates that these underpayments by the oil companies cost the taxpayers up to $66 million a year. And the oil companies that enjoy this cut-rate drilling are not small independent producers. On the contrary, the oil companies that benefit are among the largest in the world. Names like Exxon, Chevron, BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield. 
   I'd like to take a moment to Call the Bankroll on these companies, something I do from time to time in this chamber to remind my colleagues and the public about the role money plays in our legislative debates and decisions here in this chamber. 
   During the 1997-1998 election cycle, oil companies gave the following in political donations to the parties and to federal candidates:  
   Exxon gave more than $230,000 in soft money and more than $480,000 in PAC money; 
   Chevron gave more than $425,000 in soft money and more than $330,000 in PAC money; 
   Atlantic Richfield gave more than $525,000 in soft money and $150,000 in PAC money;

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today, along with a number of my colleagues, to introduce a bill in response to the ongoing violence in East Timor. 
   I am outraged at what is going on in East Timor today. The Indonesian government clearly has not lived up to its commitment to maintain security following the recent referendum. In fact it is openly supporting the militia violence against the majority of East Timorese, who have made clear their desire for an independent East Timor. If the Indonesian government cannot, or will not, maintain peace, I believe an international peacekeeping mission is the best option. The United States and the rest of the international community must exercise any and all leverage it has with the Indonesians to allow for this contingency. In addition, the United States provides a great deal of economic and military assistance to Indonesia. If the Indonesian government does not take steps to stop the violence occurring in East Timor, we should suspend these benefits. 
   For that reason, I am today introducing a bill which cuts off all military and most economic assistance to the government of Indonesia until the President determines and certifies to the Congress that a safe and secure environment exists in East Timor which will allow the East Timorese who have fled the militia-led violence to return to their homes, allow the United Nations Assistance Mission to East Timor, UNAMET, to resume its mandate, and allow the results of the August 30, 1999, referendum on East Timor's political status to be fully implemented. 
   At long last, on August 30, the people of East Timor went to the polls to express their will about the future of their homeland, choosing between a future as an autonomous part of Indonesia, or as an independent nation. The approximately 99 percent voter turnout in the face of intimidation from the pro-Jakarta militias is a credit to the dedication and courage of the East Timorese people to determine once and for all their own political status. 
   Ironically, the day of the ballot was relatively free of violence. But that was the calm before the storm. After the polls closed, the militias began a rampage throughout the territory that continues today. At least for UNAMET workers have been killed and at least six other are missing. Thousands of East Timorese have fled their homes, which are being looted and burned at will by the militias. 
   According to some estimates, in the past week alone, several hundred people have been killed, and more than 30,000 have been forced to flee their homes. Television news reports have shown desperate East Timorese citizens scaling the razor-sharp barbed wire fence surrounding the UNAMET mission in order to escape the automatic weapons of the advancing militias. There have been reports of beheadings. Nobel Laureate Bishop Carlos Belo and about six thousand East Timorese who sought refuge in his home in Dili were forced to flee when his home was burned to the ground. Bishop Belo, who has endured years of intimidation and countless threats on his life, has since fled to Australia. The United Nations is evacuating many of its workers and international observers. 
   The result of the ballot, which was announced on September 4, was overwhelming--78.5 percent of East Timorese voted for independence. This crushing defeat for the pro-Jakarta militias and their supporters sparked even more violence. 
   Unfortunately, this is just the latest in a wave of violence that has plagued East Timor for almost a quarter of a century. At this point, I would like to recount some of East Timor's history--the events that have brought the people of that territory to the horrific violence that is being unleashed upon them as I speak these words. 
   The East Timorese people have a long history of foreign domination. The Portuguese ruled there for four centuries. In 1975, less than a year after the Portuguese colonial rulers left East Timor, the Indonesian army occupied East Timor, and it remains there today. For 24 years, the people of East Timor have been subjugated by the Indonesian government and harassed by the Indonesian military. 
   The November 1991 massacre of non-violent demonstrators in the East Timorese capital of Dili is but one example of Indonesia's repressive occupation of East Timor. Despite the harsh rule of the Suharto regime--or maybe in spite of it--the people of East Timor held on to their hope for self-determination. This dream is personified by people such as Nobel Peace Prize winners Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Carlos Belo, who have worked tirelessly, and at great personal risk, for the liberation of the people of East Timor. 
   Following Suharto's resignation in 1998, it appeared that some positive changes were on the horizon for the people of East Timor. This comes after January 27, 1999, President B.J. Habibie announced that the government of Indonesia was finally willing to learn--and respect--the wishes of the people in that territory. On May 5, 1999, the governments of Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement to hold a United Nations-supervised ``consultation'' on the future of East Timor. 
   Before the ink was even dry on this agreement, proJakarta militia groups--better described as lawless thugs--began a campaign of terror and intimidation against the East Timorese people aimed at quashing the independence movement. And these thugs operated freely while the Indonesian military looked the other way, and in some cases, helped them. 
   In the weeks leading up to the historic referendum, the militias targeted supporters of East Timorese independence, and members of the UNAMET who were in the territory preparing for the vote. 
   And now, the implementation of the results of this ballot, an effort which has already been paid for by the blood of more than 200,000 East Timorese who have been killed since 1975, is being delayed by more violence from criminals who cannot accept the defeat they received at the polls. 
   Despite his promise to respect the wishes of the East Timorese people, President Habibie has done little to stop the violence. Yesterday, he imposed martial law in East Timor, but this announcement has not ended the militia rampage, and the Indonesian military has done nothing to halt the violence. I am concerned that martial law will only embolden the militias. 
   The bill which I am introducing today calls on the Indonesian government to foster an environment in which the result of the August 30 referendum can be fully implemented. And if the Indonesian government does not take steps to that end, all U.S. military and most economic assistance to Indonesia will be cut off. Period.  
   For too long, the Congress has allowed military and economic assistance to be awarded to the government of Indonesia, with few conditions, despite its miserable human rights record and its deplorable treatment of the people of East Timor. It is high time that the Indonesian government learns that the U.S. will not tolerate the violent suppression of the legitimate democratic aspiration of the people of East Timor. 
   Earlier this week, President Habibie asked the Indonesian people to remain calm in the face of the referendum results. It is past time for him to direct the Indonesian army to stop the militias and to discipline those army personnel who are in collusion with the militias in their rampage through East Timor. 
   It is imperative that President Habibie and his government understand that the United States Congress will not sit idly by while bands of thugs continue to loot and burn East Timor, kill innocent civilians, and drive people from their homes. 
   President Habibie said earlier this year that he would respect the wishes of the people of East Timor. His government also promised the World Bank that it would live up to its commitments to the United Nations. It is time he shows that these statements were more than just political rhetoric. He must stop the violence, and he must allow international peacekeepers to enter East Timor without the threat of attack from militias or members of the Indonesian army. 
   I hope the Senate will act on this important legislation at the earliest possible date. We must not allow the Indonesian government to continue to receive U.S. military and economic assistance so long as it is condoning the terror in East Timor. 
   So, Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk. Because of the urgency of the situation in East Timor, I ask that it be considered as soon as possible. 
   Mr. President, I am delighted that the next speaker will be a person who has devoted an incredible energy to this issue; in fact, who recently had the willingness and courage to go to East Timor, Senator REED of Rhode Island.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' attention to the plight of refugees in Africa. Just last week we have been reminded yet again of the disparity in the resources provided to assist those in need on the African continent compared to those in Europe. At a briefing to the U.N. Security Council on July 26, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata outlined some of the desperate problems facing the over 1.5 million refugees the agency currently counts in Africa. These problems are aggravated by a serious shortfall in international funding for UN refugee efforts. By some accounts, only 60% of the UNHCR's $137  million budget for general programs for Africa has been funded to date. The total UNHCR funding for all of Africa for 1999, including the general program, special programs, and emergencies, is only $302 million. That compares to $520 million set aside just for special programs and emergencies for the Former Yugoslavia. 
   The international response to the refugee crisis in Africa remains woefully inadequate. The situation is made even worse by the disparity between the donations offered to assist European refugees and those offered to support African refugees. As Mrs. Ogata so succinctly noted on July 26, ``Undeniably, proximity, strategic interest and extraordinary media focus have played a key role in determining the quality and level of response.'' While this may explain why Kosovo has received far greater refugee assistance than have the multiple crises in Africa, it can not justify that imbalance. The suffering of a family driven from its home or a child wrenched from its family by war is no less because it happens in Africa, away from the media glare and the familiar sources of conflict in Europe. 
   While I understand that there are necessary limits to the resources available for the millions of refugees in the world, I believe we should render our precious contribution to humanitarian assistance in a fair and balanced manner. As I have said many times on this floor--why Kosovo and not Sudan or Sierra Leone or Rwanda? To those who will cite our ``strategic'' interests in Europe, I respond that I believe our ``moral'' interests are also critically important to this nation's standing in the world. 
   I appreciate the State Department's announcement of an additional mid-year $11.7 million contribution to the UNHCR's general program, of which $6.6 million was designated for Africa. This is a good start, but it still falls far short of what Africa needs and what Europe gets. It does not please me to have to highlight the regional disparity in refugee assistance. But I believe it is important for the Senate to be on record in strong support of a fair and balanced effort to meet the needs of refugees throughout the world.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand together today with my distinguished colleague, Senator LEAHY, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, on a bill that protects the rights of state and local governments. 
   Mr. President, the bill that Senator LEAHY introduced today addresses an egregious affront to state and local authority. Indeed, the Federal Communications Commission's proposed rule on telecommunications tower siting is an explicit transfer of power to the federal government. 
   Mr. President, the FCC would have the American people believe that it understands state and local land use issues better than the folks back home. It's proposed rule, itself promoted by a special interest group, would preempt state and local zoning and land use restrictions on the siting and construction of telecommunications towers. This is not the way the Federal government should be operating. 
   The FCC's proposed rule would set specific time limits within state and local governments must act in response to requests for approval of the placement, construction or modification of these towers. In addition, the rule would ``remove from local consideration certain types of restrictions on the siting and construction of transmission facilities.'' And finally, the rule would preempt all state and local laws that impair the ability of licensed broadcasters to construct or modify towers unless the state or local government can prove that their regulation is ``reasonable in relation to a clearly defined and expressly stated health or safety objective. 
   Mr. President, the proposal infringes on the rights of states and localities to make important zoning decisions in accordance with their own development objectives. It infringes also on the rights of residents of states and localities to fully enjoy the protection of rules requiring notification of adjacent land owners, hearing requirements and appeal periods. Under the proposed rule, the Federal government would impose specific time periods during which zoning disputes between entities seeking to build or modify towers and the state or locality must be resolved. 
   The rule also appears to preempt entirely a local or state law regarding tower placement even if that law is intended to ensure the health or safety of the community. The rule would allow health and safety concerns to be overridden by the federal interest in the construction of transmission facilities and in the promotion of fair and effective competition among electronic media. It is unclear why the business operations of telecommunications companies should override local health and safety concerns. 
   State or local zoning or land use laws designed to address historic or aesthetic objectives also would be preempted under this rule. 
   Mr. President, states and localities should be able to maintain the right to control development within their own jurisdictions without undue interference from the Federal government. Federal preemption of zoning decisions should be the exception rather than the rule. The proposed rule would make federal preemption of legitimate local and state zoning and land use laws commonplace. 
   Why would we allow this end run around state and local authority, Mr. President? It goes completely against the philosophy of state and local autonomy that so many of my colleagues support. 
   To try and get to the bottom of this, Mr. President, I'd like to Call the Bankroll, which I do from time to time during my remarks on this floor. I'm going to offer some information about the political donations that have been made by the telecommunications giants that have a huge stake in the wireless communications industry. That industry has been lobbying hard in favor of the FCC rule, which empowers the federal government to overrule local communities that don't want a tower in their town. 
   During the least election cycle, the following telecommunications companies with a stake in the wireless market gave millions upon millions of dollars to candidates and the political parties: 
   .Bell Atlantic gave more than $920,000 in soft money and nearly $885,000 in PAC money; 
   .Wireless manufacturer Motorola gave $100,000 in soft and money and nearly $110,000 in PAC money; 
   .The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, the lobbying arm of the wireless industry, gave more than $100,000 in soft money and more than $85,000 to candidates; 
   .And AT&T gave nearly $825,000 in soft money to the parties and nearly $820,000 in PAC money to candidates. 
   Certainly, this FCC rule is not the only thing these companies are lobbying for, Mr. President. But whenever wealthy interests wants something, they have the weight of their contributions behind them. Those contributions influence what we do, and they deserve to be noted in this discussion. I think it's vitally important that we keep these 
   contributions in mind as we evaluate the proposed rule, and we try to understand why the FCC would propose it, and why a Congress full of members who support state and local autonomy would stand for it. 
   But Mr. President, now I'd like to get to the good news--the bill authored by the distinguished senior senator from Vermont, which would repeal limitations on state and local authority regarding the placement of, construction of and modifications to telecommunications towers. It would do so by prohibiting the FCC from adopting as final the proposed rule. And the bill does so in a responsible manner. 
   Senator LEAHY's bill incorporates aviation industry concerns by allowing state and local governments to require tower construction applications to be accompanied by documentation showing compliance with applicable state and local aviation standards. It acknowledges alternative technologies which can be used in place of towers, including satellite and cable. It authorizes state and local governments to require evidence from companies showing that the proposed tower would comply with federal health and environmental standards. And it maintains the authority of state and local governments to ensure that companies comply with statements, assertions and representations made while applying for permission to locate a broadcast facility. 
   Mr. President, as new telecommunication towers have sprouted up by the thousands from coast to coast, so has the ire of our residents. To quote my distinguished colleague from Vermont, I too don't want Wisconsin turned into a giant pin cushion with 200-foot towers sticking out of every hill and valley. 
   Mr. President, Wisconsin will be a leader in the information age, but Wisconsinites deserve the right to determine where towers are located within Wisconsin. More than a few Wisconsin communities, large and small, have voiced their clear opposition to the heavy hand of the Federal government on this issue. Various communities and groups, from the city of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Regional Cable Commission to the cities of Fond du Lac and Brookfield to the Dodge County Board of Supervisors, the Lincoln County Zoning Committee, and the Oneida County Planning and Zoning Committee have contacted me to voice their opposition to the proposed rule. 
   And other communities that have voiced opposition to recent tower siting plans, including Delafield, Fox Point, Bayside, Elm Grove, Germantown, Heartland, Mequon, Muskego, St. Francis, and Whitefish Bay. 
   One resident of Cassian, Wisconsin, summed up the feeling of many Wisconsinites: ``We don't want to become a tower farm.'' 
   Mr. President, the FCC clearly has overstepped its regulatory bounds. We should empower state and local governments, not emasculate them. I hope my colleagues will support the rights of our states and municipalities, not more Federal autocracy. I commend my colleague for introducing this important piece of legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I first thank the senior Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership and dedication on this issue. He has been determined, and I think effectively, in fighting this battle that we have to fight on behalf of Wisconsin dairy farmers, upper Midwestern dairy farmers, and I think dairy farmers all over this country. I thank him and join in his words that we will fight this thing as hard and as long as we have to, to prevent this extremely unfair idea of trying to continue the New England Dairy Compact. 
   But the really interesting thing about the measure before us, the issue the cloture is going to be about, is that it really does not have the impact that a lot of Senators think it might have.  
   The Jeffords-Leahy amendment that they have offered will withhold funding--it will withhold funding--for implementation of the Federal milk marketing order reform in an attempt to preserve the Northeastern Interstate Dairy Compact. 
   They thought this amendment would produce the same result it did when a similar amendment was offered during the appropriations bill last year--and that is a delay of milk marketing order reform--and then an extension of the compact. But it does not do that. As the senior Senator from Wisconsin has indicated, it does not do that. 
   This isn't what the 61 Senators whom the Senator from Vermont was talking about signed a letter about. It isn't about picking 1-B or 1-A. That isn't what it does. What it simply does is create chaos. That is exactly what Senator KOHL has indicated. And we are not asking you to just take our word for it. Take the word of the general counsel of the USDA, who has made it clear that he believes the legal effect of this latest dairy initiative by the Senators from Vermont will be uncertainty and no Federal oversight of the system. 
   A lack of funding at USDA will throw administration of the Federal Milk Marketing Order Program into chaos, effectively leaving no program at all. 
   The Senator from Vermont hangs his hat on the notion that this letter says, at the end, that the issue involves novel questions. But that ignores the heart of the letter, which I want to repeat. It is a letter addressed to Senator KOHL, dated August 2, 1999, from Charles Rawls, general counsel, U.S. Department of Agriculture. It says:  
   You are correct in your understanding that existing marketing orders and the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact will expire upon implementation of milk marketing order reform on October 1st. If the Department were prohibited from spending appropriations to carry out the order reform, it would not be able to provide oversight for the milk marketing order system. Day-to-day operation of the respective order areas could continue, however, because such operations are funded through industry assessments, not appropriated funds.  
   So it is not equivocal about whether, in fact, this will happen. It simply says that the compact will expire and that in fact at this point we will not have an order system. That is not ambiguous. 
   I think it is very ironic that the Senator from Vermont came up and tried to argue that somehow our position on this is unfair to the rest of the country. It is just the reverse. The amendment that has been offered actually makes things much worse for almost the entire country than the current status under the bill. 
   Under the Jeffords-Leahy amendment, the impact on dairy income in various regions is startling. For the Northeast--if you can believe this--it involves a net loss of $225 million in dairy income, if this chaos ensues; in the Appalachia area, $122 million in lost dairy income; in Florida, $100 million; in the Southeast, $112 million in lost dairy income--and down the line. 
   Overall, I believe the figure is a total loss of some $194 million net income if this amendment goes through and the consequence that we believe occurs.

It will not do that. It will just lead to a chaotic situation--that the Department of Agriculture cannot do their job of administering the milk marketing order system.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me associate myself with all of the comments of the senior Senator from Wisconsin with regard to the merits of this amendment. 
   Again, I agree that this has to be one of the most bizarre pieces of the American economy that the Congress ever sought to set up. 
   We are extremely pleased and happy with the vote on cloture. There was a full court press to try to get cloture on this very hard fought issue. 
   Frankly, the proponents of the compact didn't even come close. That is the message that is sent. 
   So when the Senator from Pennsylvania indicates that he is going to withdraw this amendment, which certainly is within his rights, and then fight for it in conference, let me simply point out at this point that I could offer a point of order, which I assume would be agreed to by the Presiding Officer, which would make it clear and indisputable that this simply does not belong on an appropriations bill under rule XVI. That is clear. 
   So if it isn't appropriate in the Senate to do it, and it is against our rules, I would suggest it doesn't belong in conference either. 
   The message from the Senate is clear. All the efforts were made on both sides to try to win that cloture vote. The message is very simple. This body is not representing to the conference or anyone else any other conclusion other than that the compact should come to an end, as the Secretary of Agriculture has proposed. 
   I will not offer that point of order in deference to the Senator from Pennsylvania. But I want to be very clear in the RECORD that that is the posture from the Senate as this bill ultimately goes to conference. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'm proud to represent a state that produces a wide variety of the highest quality agricultural products, from dairy products to cranberries, ginseng, corn, wheat--the list goes on, and it is as varied as Wisconsin itself. 
   Agriculture is the lifeblood of my state, so when a bill like Agriculture Appropriations comes to the floor, I feel it's vitally important that every aspect of the legislation--including the interests attempting to influence this debate--be discussed and examined. 
   Earlier this year when I gave remarks on this floor, I promised that from time to time when I participate in debates on legislation I would point out the role of special interest money in our legislative process, an effort I am calling The Calling of the Bankroll. 
   That's why today I want to briefly highlight some of the political contributions that have been made by the agriculture industry--money spent to influence the way we approach agriculture appropriations on this floor, in the other body, and at the White House. 
   Agriculture interests have donated nearly $3 million in soft money during the last election cycle, and $15.6 million in PAC money. That's well over $18 million overall--and again that's during just a two-year period. 
   The soft money numbers are particularly interesting, Mr. President, because they reflect a pattern that a number of special interests follow, known as ``double giving'' or ``switch hitting.'' It means that a donor doesn't just give soft money to one party, the party whose political views the donor might favor. Instead double givers amass political clout by donating generously to both parties. 
   Examples of these soft money double givers in the agriculture industry during the last cycle include the Archer Daniels Midland Company, which donated $263,000 to the Democrats and $255,000 to the Republicans; United States Sugar Corp, which donated $157,500 to the Democrats and almost $250,000 to the Republicans; and Ocean Spray Cranberries Incorporated, which donated $156,060 to the Democrats and $117,600 to the Republicans. 
   Those are just a handful of examples, Mr. President, but I think they give my colleagues an idea of how the double-giving game is played. 
   Of course not everyone is a double giver. The top agribusiness soft money donor to the Democratic party, crop producer Connell Company, gave $435,000, all to the Democratic party committees. Dole Food Company gave more than $200,000 in soft money in 1997 and 1998, all to Republican party committees. 
   And in the interest of fairness, Mr. President, I also should mention an agribusiness donor that shares my position against the extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact: The International Dairy Foods Association, which gave more than $71,000 in soft money during 1997 and 1998 all to the Republican party committees. 
   There are many interests that will be affected by what we do here on this floor with regard to agriculture appropriations, Mr. President, and some have more resources to influence this debate than others. It is in the spirit of providing a fuller picture of the debate over agricultural issues--and the wealthy interests that seek to influence the debate's outcome--that I have presented this information, both for the benefit of the public and my colleagues. 
   I thank the chair and I yield the floor.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute one of our nation's most beloved nature writers and dedicated wilderness conservationists, Mr. Sigurd Olson. As an architect of the federal government's protection of wilderness areas, as well as a poetic voice that captured the importance of these pristine sites, Mr. Olson left us and our children a legacy of natural sanctuaries and an ethic by which to better appreciate them. 
   Mr. President, 1999 marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Sigurd Olson. Over the July recess, I had the opportunity to travel to Northern Minnesota to commemorate and celebrate Sigurd Olson's life and work. I think it is fitting that the Senate take this opportunity to honor the life of Mr. Olson, who sadly passed away 17 years ago, and to renew our dedication to continue his legacy of wilderness preservation. 
   Born in Chicago in 1899, Sigurd Olson and his family soon moved to the beautiful Door County Peninsula of Wisconsin. It was there that he formed his life-long attachment to nature and to outdoor recreation. Half a century later, he described what he experienced as a boy along the coast of Green Bay:  
   A school of perch darted in and out of the rocks. They were green and gold and black, and I was fascinated by their beauty. Seagulls wheeled and cried above me. Waves crashed against the pier. I was alone in a wild and lovely place, part of the dark forest through which I had come, and of all the wild sounds and colors and feelings of the place I had found. That day I entered into a life of indescribable beauty and delight. There I believe I heard the singing wilderness for the first time.  
   A few years after graduating from the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Olson moved to northeastern Minnesota. He traveled and guided for many years in the surrounding millions of acres of lakeland wilderness--what eventually became the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness--and he grew convinced that wilderness provided the spiritual experiences vital to modern society. It was this conviction that formed the basis of both his conservation and his writing careers. As he said at a Sierra Club conference in 1965:  
   I have discovered in a lifetime of traveling in primitive regions, a lifetime of seeing people living in the wilderness and using it, that there is a hard core of wilderness need in everyone, a core that makes its spiritual values a basic human necessity. There is no hiding it....... Unless we can preserve places where the endless spiritual needs of man can be fulfilled and nourished, we will destroy our culture and ourselves.  
    Olson became an active conservationist in the 1920's, fighting to keep roads, dams and airplanes out of his ``special place'' in northeastern Minnesota. He went on to serve as the president of both the National Parks Association and the Wilderness Society. Yet, perhaps his greatest contribution to conservation came during his tenure as an advisor to Secretary of the Interior from 1959 to the early 1970's, when he helped draft the Wilderness Act, which became law in 1964 and established the U.S. wilderness preservation system that still exists today. 
   While I never knew Sigurd Olson, those who worked with ``Sig,'' as he was called, were infected by his unwavering commitment to the Boundary Waters and his desire to help people truly understand the meaning and legacy of wilderness. 
   Central to Olson's agenda was his perseverance as public advocate for the Boundary Waters, in spite of the sometimes quite open hostility that he faced in taking that stand. Twenty-two years ago on July 8, 1977, a public field hearing was held at Ely High School on Congressman Fraser's bill that became the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act of 1978. Sigurd Olson, then 77 years old, stepped forward to testify in the midst of hisses, catcalls and boos from the roughly thousand-person crowd that packed the hearing. Despite the fact that an effigy in his likeness was hanging outside the school, he testified, saying in part:  
   Some places should be preserved from development and exploitation for they satisfy a human need for solace, belonging, and perspective. In the end we turn to nature in a frenzied chaotic world to find silence--oneness--wholeness--spiritual release.  
   I am inspired by Sigurd Olson's actions in my own work, as I have been inspired by my predecessor in the United States Senate Gaylord Nelson. I also share Olson's great respect for America's public lands and for the Boundary Waters. 
   Mr. President, as I mentioned, I recently visited the Boundary Waters and spent a day canoeing in the pristine area that Olson loved so dearly on the Hegman Lake chain. His words, from his first book, The Singing Wilderness, best describe the experience:  
   The movement of a canoe is like a reed in the wind. Silence is part of it and the sounds of lapping water, bird songs, and wind in the trees. It is part of the medium through which it floats, the sky, the water, the shores....... There is magic in the feel of a paddle and the movement of a canoe, a magic compounded of distance, adventure, solitude, and peace. The way of a canoe is the way of the wilderness, and of a freedom almost forgotten. It is an antidote to insecurity, the open door to waterways of ages past and a way of life with profound and abiding satisfactions. When a man is part of his canoe, he is part of all that canoes have ever known.  
   In addition to canoeing the Hegman Lakes, I also had an opportunity to visit Listening 
   Point on Burntside Lake with Sigurd Olson's son, Bob Olson, and Bob's wife, Vonnie Olson.  Many people have a special place where they go to experience nature. Perhaps it is a park, or a campsite, or a favorite hiking trail. For Sigurd Olson, it was a cabin on a tree-covered glaciated point of rock. He called it his ``Listening Point,'' and it is at the center of his book of the same name. 
   In his book, Sigurd Olson talks about that place on Burntside Lake from his first night sleeping there under the stars to the eventual building of his cabin: 
   ``From this one place I would explore the entire north and all life, including my own,'' he writes. ``For me, it would be a listening-post from which I might even hear the music of the spheres.''  
   From his cabin, Olson also experienced the wonder and danger of significant storms in the Boundary Waters, an experience nearly identical to my own. Over the Fourth of July weekend this year, shortly before I arrived, serious winds hit the Boundary Waters, downing trees in a quarter of the wilderness area. 
   I was comforted to learn, as I arrived at Listening Point to see Bob Olson clearing trees from the driveway, that Listening Point has weathered significant storms before. Sigurd Olson writes of another storm, and its aftermath in Of Time and Place:  
   As we approached Listening Point we could see the damage, trees down and twisted, blocking the road to the cabin. We chopped and hacked our way through to the turnaround and found the trail to the cabin was a crisscross of broken treetops, a jackstraw puzzle of tangled debris. It was unbelievable; I looked at the trees, remembering how over the years we had treasured each one of them....... 
   Olson continues: 
   I sometimes wonder about the meaning of such things as this tornado--why it happened, why it leapfrogged over some areas and hit others. We paddled to the islands beyond Listening Point and saw where many trees had been blown over, all old landmarks along the shore. They would lie there for many years until they, too, would sink into the soil and disappear. 
   Mr. President, I have been a defender of the Boundary Waters, and my constituents adore this area. 
   I have also joined in the fight to protect the public lands of Southern Utah, and have sponsored legislation to have the lands of wilderness potential in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore identified. All my efforts are linked to unfinished business that Sigurd Olson began in the Boundary Waters and to his commitment to designating and protecting our country's special wild places. 
   In addition to conveying my own admiration for Sigurd Olson, I rise today to share the reflections of my own home state. Wisconsinites have a special fondness for Sigurd Olson for several reasons. Olson, who began his environmental education as a kid from Northern Wisconsin who loved the outdoors, turned out to be a serious conservationist whose name is among the greatest conservationists of the Twentieth Century. With his special wilderness writing, Olson was a reformer who didn't come across as self-important. 
   Second, Wisconsinites truly appreciate an accomplished outdoor enthusiast turned advocate. That's a rarity in politics, especially these days. Olson will be long remembered for his character and fundamental decency in defense of the wilderness he loved. On behalf of myself and the citizens of my state, as well as all Americans, I wish Sigurd Olson a very happy birthday. We are a greater country for his dedication.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment eliminates the percentage depletion allowance for minerals mined on Federal public lands. It applies only to hard rock minerals and does not touch oil and gas, and it preserves the deduction for private lands. 
   The President's fiscal year 2000 budget recommends eliminating this tax break. OMB estimates this amendment would raise $478 million over 5 years. 
   We allow companies to mine on public lands for very low patent fees already. We shouldn't continue to provide them with a double subsidy by preserving this special tax break for hard rock mining companies which ordinary businesses do not get. 
   I understand this will be the subject of a voice vote.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana. 
   Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments on the reconciliation tax measure we are considering. 
   First, let me note that we have come a long way in the last seven years. 
   When I first came to the Senate, we were facing an actual budget deficit of $340 million. 
   That was the real figure--the figure that did not use the Social Security Trust Fund balances to mask the deficit. 
   Thanks in large part to the President's deficit reduction package in 1993, and to a lesser extent the bipartisan budget cuts of 1997, we are approaching a truly balanced budget. 
   I emphasize `'approaching,'' Mr. President, for we are not there yet. 
   The budget projections of the Office of Management and Budget, and of the Congressional Budget Office, are just that--projections. 
   We do not currently have a budget surplus, not without including the Social Security Trust Fund balances. 
   Mr. President, I do not mean to minimize the wonderful budget turnabout that has been achieved. 
   But we should not be building massive new commitments on a shaky foundation of questionable budget assumptions. 
   And that is just what we have. 
   The assumptions underlying the tax measure we will debate depend on Congress making cuts of $775 billion in real spending over the next ten years compared to current levels. 
   Let me note that this level of cuts does not include any additional cuts that might have to be made in order to offset the cost of unanticipated emergencies. 
   Let me repeat that, Mr. President. 
   The $775 billion in real spending cuts over the next ten years does not include the spending we do to help the victims of hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, or any kind of international emergency. 
   But, for the moment, let us suppose that there will be no hurricanes, or earthquakes, or tornadoes, or floods in the next ten years. 
   Let us suppose that there will be no international emergencies that require our assistance. 
   Will Congress find the political will to cut spending by three-quarters of a trillion dollars over the next ten years? 
   Mr. President, Congress has yet to demonstrate it can stay even within the current spending caps, let alone find an additional three-quarters of a trillion dollars in cuts. 
   Last fall, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill that busted the current spending caps by more than $20 billion. 
   This past winter, even before we passed a budget resolution, the Senate passed another budget buster, S. 4, the military pay and retirement measure, which over the next ten years would add another $62 billion in spending. 
   And just a few weeks ago, Congress busted the spending caps yet again with $15 billion in additional spending. 
   Mr. President, this is not a record of fiscal discipline. 
   Nor is it the kind of record that should give anyone confidence that the budget assumptions underlying this tax bill are sound ones. 
   Mr. President, the assumptions underlying this tax bill are grounded not in fiscal reality but in political expediency. 
   But, let us assume that somehow, Congress was able to enact the three-quarters of a trillion dollars in spending cuts. 
   And let us further assume, as we did earlier, that there will be no hurricanes, or floods, or earthquakes, or drought, or any other kind of natural disaster for the next ten years. 
   And that there will be no more Bosnias or Kosovos or Iraqs--no international emergencies of any kind for the next ten years. 
   Even under all of these assumptions, would this tax proposal be a sound one? 
   The answer is no, because even if each and every one of those rosy scenarios comes true, this bill would use over $75 billion in Social Security balances to pay for the tax breaks. 
   Mr. President, I strongly oppose using Social Security to fund tax cuts; that is why I voted against the 1997 tax cut package. 
   We simply should not be using Social Security balances--balances needed to pay future benefits--to fund other government programs, or to pay for tax cuts. 
   Of course, some may argue that even more spending cuts will be found in order to avoid the use of Social Security balances--on the top of the three-quarters of a trillion dollars in cuts assumed in this measure.  
   Mr. President, granting even this still rosier scenario, would this tax measure be fiscally responsible? 
   I regret that it would not, because not only does this tax bill risk our current budget, it puts future generations at risk as well. 
   Mr. President, while the revenue impact of any tax cut measure can be expected to grow over time, the policies outlined in this measure explode. 
   Consider that while in the next ten years, the cost of this proposal is an already whopping $800 billion--if those tax policies are continued, the cost in the second ten years will be a nearly unbelievable $2 trillion. 
   If you add the additional interest payments that will arise from debt service, the total cost of the tax policies in this bill rise to over $3 trillion. 
   For those who may have forgotten, let me remind my colleagues that it is in that second ten years when the baby boomer generation begins to retire and put increased pressure on Social Security, Medicare, and the long-term care services provided under Medicaid. 
   If ever there were a time to be prudent, now is the time. 
   As improved as the short-term budget picture is, the longer-term budget picture is little changed. 
   We still face serious problems in Medicare, and as I noted, the baby boomer generation will put enormous pressure on that program, as well as on the long-term care services, many of which are provided through Medicaid. 
   There is also a consensus that we should address the long-term fiscal health of Social Security, and the sooner the better. 
   And finally, Mr. President, we still face a mountain of debt that was run up during the 1980s and early 1990s because of the deficits that were run up during that time. 
   In each of these areas, there is a stark choice: we can act now to address each of these areas; or, we can ignore them, watch the problems get much worse, and leave the work and cost of reform to our children and grandchildren. 
   Mr. President, for me, that's an easy choice. 
   I do not want my children footing the bill for the failure of past generations to act responsible. 
   I want to support a tax cut, but not one that jeopardizes the work we have done to straighten out the current budget and squanders the opportunity to reduce our debt and put Social Security, Medicare, and our long-term care system on sound footing. 
   Mr. President, let me take a moment to look at the make-up of the tax measure itself. 
   One might expect that a tax cut of $800 billion would provide the sort of broad-based tax benefits that would be politically attractive. 
   But given the amount of revenue dedicated to this tax cut, the benefits to the average taxpayer are surprisingly small, and the overall package is heavily skewed to some of the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the world. 
   As was noted by the tax watchdog group Citizens for Tax Justice, the tax bill gives three-quarters of its benefits to the best-off fifth of all taxpayers. 
   By contrast, only 11 percent of the tax bill's benefits go to the bottom 60 percent of all taxpayers. 
   While the average tax reduction for the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers--those with incomes over $300,000--is over $23,000 a year under this bill, those with more average income do not do quite as well. 
   The average tax cut for those who are among the middle fifth of taxpayers will be $279, or about $5 per week. 
   For those in the bottom three-fifths of all taxpayers, the average tax cut is even smaller--about $140 per year, or less than $3 per week. 
   Mr. President, under this $800 billion tax bill, the majority of taxpayers will have an average tax cut of $3 per week. 
   Maybe the proponents of this bill are hoping most of America will use this windfall to buy one of those overpriced cups of coffee. 
   Well, Mr. President, thanks to this tax bill, once a week, three-fifths of America will now be able to go to one of those fancy coffee shops and get a frothy decaf cappuccino latte with skim milk. 
   This tax bill is a bad tax policy any way you brew it. 
   Mr. President, I recognize that some may genuinely believe we should dedicate about $800 billion to tax cuts over the next ten years. 
   The tragedy is that even in that context, the $800 billion was spent unwisely, because in addition to Social Security, Medicare, long-term care, and reducing our national debt, one of our highest priorities should be significant reform of our tax code. 
   It was just a few months ago that we heard how critical fundamental tax reform was to our future. 
   Flat tax, consumption tax, a national value-added tax--there were a number of significant proposals that sought to address the inefficiency of our current Tax Code. 
   Simplification was the order of the day, and let me add, Mr. President, that while I did not support many of those proposals, I think many of the proponents of reform got it exactly right. 
   Our Tax Code should be simplified. 
   We should reduce the number of special interest tax breaks and use that savings to lower the tax rates for everyone. 
   I participated in just that kind of exercise at the State level as chair of the Taxation Committee in the Wisconsin State Senate. 
   As we all know, there will be winners and losers in a reform of our tax code, and I can tell you from direct experience that the best time to enact tax reforms is when you have additional resources to help increase the number of winners and decrease the number of losers. 
   Mr. President, this tax bill and the House version both squandered that opportunity as well. 
   We might have had a significant start on real tax reform. 
   Instead, we got a grab bag of goodies for special interests added to a tax code already thick with complexity. 
   A recent article in the Washington Post listed a number of the special interest tax breaks in this bill and the House version. 
   They include tax breaks for: multinational corporations, utility companies, railroad, oil and gas operators, timber companies, the steel industry, seaplane owners in Alaska, sawmills in Maine, barge lines in Mississippi, Eskimo whaling captains, and Carolina woodlot owners. 
   This bill is a dream come true for business lobbyists. 
   The Post reported one lobbyist as saying, ``If you're a business lobbyist and couldn't get into this legislation, you better turn in your six-shooter.'' 
   Mr. President, in the name of complete disclosure, let me note that I understand the Democratic alternative, which I may support, suffers from the same problem, though to a much lesser extent. 
   And it will come as no surprise to my colleagues that I firmly believe this kind of pandering to special interests is a direct result of our campaign finance system. 
   There's ample evidence to that effect right here in this bill. 
   The campaign finance system gives wealthy interest an open invitation to influence legislation in this body, and in this bill it's clear that special interests accepted that invitation in droves, Mr. President. 
   For the benefit of my colleagues and the public, I'd like to share just a few examples of what these interests gave in PAC and soft money, and what they got in either this bill, the House tax measure, or both. 
   I do this from time to time; it is known as ``The Calling of the Bankroll.'' 
   According to the Washington Post, an umbrella organization called the Coalition of Service Industries, a coalition of banks and securities firms, won a provision to extend for five years a temporary tax deferral on income those industries earn abroad. The value of this tax deferral: $5 billion over ten years. 
   So we know what Congress has given the Coalition of Service Industries, but what has the Coalition of Service Industries given to candidates and the political parties? During the 1997-1998 election cycle, coalition members gave the following: 
   Ernst & Young--more than half a million dollars in soft money, and nearly $900,000 in PAC money.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a bill whose time has come. 
   Mr. President, it is a decade since the Berlin Wall came down, heralding the end of the Cold War. Since then, we have reduced our nuclear arsenal, as have the Russians. And our Navy is advocating to downsize the Trident nuclear submarine fleet, the cornerstone of our nuclear triad strategy. It's just common sense to limit future production of weapons deployed in those submarines. 
   The bill I introduce today would terminate future production of the Trident II missile. In doing so, this common sense bill would save American taxpayers $5 billion over the next five years, and more than $13 billion over the next ten years. 
   Mr. President, the Trident II, or D-5 missile, is the Navy's submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The missile is a Cold War relic that was designed specifically to be a first-strike strategic missile that would attack targets inside the Soviet Union from waters off the continental United States. 
   The Trident II is deployed aboard Ohio-class nuclear submarines in the order of 24 per boat. Each missile is loaded with 8 independently targetable, nuclear warheads. In other words, 192 warheads per submarine. The warheads bear 300- to 475-kilotons of explosive power. Doing the math, that equals up to 91,200 kilotons of warheads on each and every Trident submarine. 
   Mr. President, the truth of the matter is we all know that one submarine firing 192 warheads could bring about an apocalypse on this planet. Needless to say, 18, 14, or even 10 submarines with that kind of firepower is beyond necessity. This is especially true if one considers that in addition to, yes, in addition to the SLBMS, the United States deploys 500 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles with three warheads each; 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs with 10 warheads each; and 94 B-52 and 21 B-2 bombers capable of carrying strategic nuclear warheads. 
   Mr. President, the United States is building or possesses, right now, 360 Trident II missiles. Current plans would have us purchase 65 more missiles through 2005. The 360 missiles we already own are more than enough to fully arm the ten existing Trident II-armed submarines as well as maintain an adequate test flight program. We simply do not need 65 more missiles. Nor do we need to backfit four Trident I, or C4, missile carrying submarines to carry Trident IIs, especially when one considers that the C4 submarines won't even outlast the Trident I missiles they carry. 
   I'd like to briefly inform my colleagues on the difference between the Trident I and Trident II missiles. According to CBO, the C4 has an accuracy shortage of about 450 feet compared to the D5, or the distance from where the presiding officer is sitting right now to where the Speaker of the House is sitting down the hall. Given the fact that either missile could utterly destroy the District of Columbia many times over, spending billions of dollars to backfit the C4 submarines seems unnecessary. 
   And this is not an inexpensive program, Mr. President. According to the Congressional Budget Office, which recommends that we discontinue production of the Trident II and retire all eight C4 submarines, if we terminate production of the missile after this year and retire the C4s by 2005, we would save more than $5 billion over five years, and more than $13 billion over the next ten years. Even here in the Senate, that's real money. 
   Mr. President, I am not naive enough to believe that Russia's deteriorating infrastructure has eliminated the threat of their ballistic missile capability. And given the missile technology advances in China, North Korea, and Iran, and attempts by rogue states to buy intercontinental ballistic missiles, it is imperative that we maintain a deterrent to ward off this threat. There is still an important role for strategic nuclear weapons in our arsenal. Their role, however, is diminished dramatically from what it was in the past, and our missile procurement decisions should reflect that change. 
   Mr. President, of our known potential adversaries, only Russia and China even possess ballistic missile-capable submarines. China's one ballistic missile capable submarine is used solely as a test platform. Russia is the only potential adversary with a credible SLBM force, and its submarine capabilities have deteriorated significantly or remain far behind those of our Navy. Due to Russia's continued economic hardships, they continue to cede ground to us in technology and training. Reports even contend that Russia is having trouble keeping just one or two of its strategic nuclear submarines operational. According to General Eugene E. Habiger, USAF (Ret.) and former commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, Moscow's ``sub fleet is belly-up.'' 
   Mr. President, Russia's submarine fleet has shrunk from more than 300 vessels to about 100. Even Russia's most modern submarines can't be used to full capability because Russia can't adequately train its sailors. Clearly, the threat is diminishing. 
   Mr. President, earlier this year, Admiral Jay Johnson, the Chief of Naval 
   Operations, went before the Senate Armed Services Committee and stated unequivocally that the Pentagon believes that 14 Trident submarines is adequate to anchor the sea-based corner of the nuclear triad. Based on that testimony, the committee put forward a Department of Defense authorization bill supporting the Navy's plan. Common sense would dictate that fewer submarines warrant fewer missiles. The threat is diminishing; the Navy knows it and the Congress knows it.  
   The Navy's plan, with the Senate's agreement, to downsize our Trident submarine fleet saves valuable resources and allows us to reach START II arms levels for our SLBMs, and moves us toward future arms reduction treaties. By going with ten boats, the Navy could meet essential requirements under START II today and the anticipated requirements under a START III framework tomorrow. 
   And ultimately, Mr. President, the United States' leadership in reducing our nuclear stockpile shows our good faith, and will make Russia's passage of a START II treaty more likely. 
   This strategy of reducing our nuclear stockpile is supported widely by some of our foremost military leaders. General George Lee Butler, former commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, and an ardent advocate of our deterrent force during the Cold War, has said that ``With the end of the Cold War, these weapons are of sharply reduced utility, and there is much to be gained by substantially reducing their numbers.'' I believe we should heed his words. 
   Mr. President, more than anything else, this issue comes down to a question of priorities. Do we want to spend $13 billion over the next ten years to purchase unnecessary Trident II missiles, or do we want to use that money to address readiness concerns that we've talked a lot about but haven't addressed adequately? 
   Mr. President, for the past year, we've heard the call to address our military's readiness crisis from virtually all quarters. We were told that foremost among the readiness shortfalls were operations and maintenance as well as pay and allowances accounts. 
   A preliminary General Accounting Office report on recruitment and retention found that issues like a lack of spare parts; concerns with the health care system; increased deployments; and dissatisfaction with military leaders have at least as much effect on retention, if not more, than a pay raise. 
   And the Pentagon concurs. Last September, General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, stated that ``without relief, we will see a continuation of the downward trends in readiness ..... and shortfalls in critical skills.'' Army Chief of Staff General Dennis Reimer claimed that the military faces a ``hollow force'' without increased readiness spending. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson asserted that the Navy has a $6 billion readiness deficit. 
   To address the readiness shortfall, Mr. President, the Congress passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The bill spent close to $9 billion, but just $1 billion of it went to address the readiness shortfall. Priorities, Mr. President. 
   And last month, on the Defense appropriations bill, a couple of Senators inserted an amendment, without debate, to take $220 million from vital Army and Air Force spare parts and repair accounts, and from the National Guard equipment account to buy planes. Planes that the Pentagon doesn't even want. Sponsors of the amendment admitted readily that this was done for the benefit of a company that had lost a multi-billion dollar contract with a foreign country. Priorities, Mr. President. 
   This bill makes sense now and for the future by saving vital defense dollars now and for years to come, and by stimulating the arms treaty dialogue.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud co-sponsor of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN. Despite the proven track record of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program and widespread support from the law enforcement community, the current version of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill almost completely eliminates this important program. Senator BIDEN's amendment, however, corrects this terrible flaw in the bill. It would preserve the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services and fund the hiring of roughly 1,500 police officers through FY 2000. 
   Since its inception in 1994, the COPS Program has provided an unprecedented level of resources to communities across the nation in the fight against crime. The COPS Program has awarded $6 billion to 11,300 communities to fund the hiring of more than 100,000 police officers. The addition of 100,000 police officers represents a nearly 20% increase in the number of officers on the streets. And more cops on the streets means lower crime. Crime is at its lowest rate in 25 years and has declined for seven consecutive years. The COPS Program has a lot to do with that happy statistic. 
   What is community policing and how has it reduced crime? Community policing is a law enforcement strategy  that emphasizes establishing community partnerships, putting more officers on the street, decentralizing command functions, and promoting innovative, community-oriented strategies to prevent crime. With the recent wave of schoolhouse shootings like those that occurred in Littleton, Colorado and Jonesboro, Arkansas, there is a growing sense among Americans that we are no longer safe in our homes, in our schools, in our communities. One sure way to reduce crime and restore peace of mind is through community oriented policing. The COPS Program does just that. 
   COPS has had a positive, and very tangible, impact on communities throughout the country, including in my home state of Wisconsin, by putting more police officers on our streets and making our citizens safer. In the state of Wisconsin alone, the COPS Program has funded the equivalent of over 1,100 new officers and contributed roughly $70 million to communities to make it happen. The COPS Program has succeeded because it helps individual officers to be a friendly and familiar presence in their communities. They are building relationships with people from house to house, block to block, school to school. This community policing helps the police to do their job better, makes the neighborhoods and schools safer and, very importantly, gives residents peace of mind. 
   The current Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, however, threatens the progress in community policing and the reduction of crime our nation has seen in recent years. First, it eliminates the federal funding for local law enforcement to hire additional, needed officers. Second, it eliminates the COPS office and transfers the administration of technology and school resource officer grants to the Office of Justice Programs. This is absurd and ignores the success of the COPS Program. 
   As I travel through Wisconsin and talk to sheriffs, police chiefs and other law enforcement officers, I hear the same refrain, time after time: the COPS Program is vital to their work and has enabled them to get more officers out from behind their desks and onto the streets. I agree. The COPS Program has been a shining example of an effective partnership between local and Federal Governments. It provides federal assistance to meet local objectives. It does not interfere with local prerogatives. It does not impose mandates. The program provides funding to counties, towns and cities to enable communities to put more police on the street. Individual police and sheriff's departments have discretion over how those funds are used, because they know what problems their communities face and the places they need help most. 
   Mr. President, zero funding for hiring officers means fewer cops on the streets. Shutting down the COPS office means local law enforcement will lose the ability to participate closely in determining what funds they receive and how they are used. Senator BIDEN's amendment, however, would provide for continuing the much-lauded COPS Program to ensure that we have an additional roughly 1,500 police officers in our communities in Wisconsin and throughout the nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and continuing our drive to put more police officers on the streets and to reduce crime in our communities. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleagues, Senators GRAHAM and DEWINE, to support an amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill that will assist our local law enforcement agencies to respond in a timely fashion to life or death situations. 
   Sheriffs and police chiefs in my state and around this country have found that their hands are tied when it comes to sharing helicopters or other public aircraft with neighboring jurisdictions. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department recently became the first local law enforcement agency in Wisconsin to acquire a helicopter. Neighboring jurisdictions would like to borrow that helicopter and reimburse the Milwaukee County Sheriff for the cost of their use of that helicopter. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department is perfectly willing, indeed eager, to share its helicopter but it can't easily do so. Under current law, in order for the assisting agency to receive a cost reimbursement from the neighboring jurisdiction, the neighboring sheriff or police chief must first exhaust the possibility that a private commercial helicopter is available. Even when the neighboring law enforcement agency is faced with a serious imminent threat to life or property, the law requires the neighboring sheriff or police chief to first determine whether a privately operated helicopter is available. Mr. President, this law is absurd and puts everyone's safety at risk. 
   Law enforcement agencies use helicopters for a variety of reasons--to chase a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, in search and rescue missions, to observe crowds in public gatherings, to transport prisoners, and to detect marijuana fields. Current law, however, stands in the way of cooperation between agencies to carry out these important law enforcement functions. Cooperation between law enforcement agencies is good. It saves time, money, resources and maybe even lives. We should do all we can to promote law enforcement cooperation. 
   Saving lives and maintaining law and order is delayed if we require sheriffs and police chiefs to determine first whether they can find a private helicopter. Public safety is also jeopardized because private commercial pilots are likely not trained law enforcement personnel with experience in sensitive and sometimes dangerous situations. In addition, a commercial helicopter is most likely not equipped with the instrumentation and tools needed by law enforcement officers to do their job. But if we allow sheriffs and police chiefs to share their aircraft with neighboring jurisdictions without first exhausting private avenues, law enforcement response is far more likely to be swift and sure. 
   Current law effectively prevents law enforcement from borrowing a helicopter or other aircraft from a neighboring agency. The law must be changed and this amendment does the job. This amendment modifies the definition of ``public aircraft'' so that law enforcement agencies no longer need to make an attempt to find a private helicopter operator before using a neighboring jurisdiction's helicopter. This amendment is supported by the National Sheriffs' Association, as well as numerous police chiefs and sheriffs across the country. 
   I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators MCCAIN and HOLLINGS, for working with us on this issue. They raised some concerns, but, as described in the colloquy, they have given us assurances that they will work to resolve the urgent needs of law enforcement either on the Federal Aviation Administration appropriations bill or by the end of the year. I welcome their recognition of the magnitude of this problem to law enforcement and their willingness to work with us on this issue. 
   Mr. President, we demand that law enforcement act quickly and professionally to life or death situations, but we're not always giving them the tools they need to do their job. We must do our part. I urge my colleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to change the law and give the sheriffs and police chiefs in Wisconsin and across this country the tools they need to keep our communities safe and secure. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I promised that from time to time when I participate in debates on legislation I would point out the role of special interest money in our legislative process, an effort I have entitled the Calling of the Bankroll. When I Call the Bankroll I will describe how much money the various interests lobbying on a particular bill have spent on campaign contributions to influence our decisions here in this chamber. 
   Of course I embarked on this effort with the hope of exposing the corruption of our current campaign finance system, and in particular how wealthy donors exploit the soft money loophole. 
   When I began this effort, I never worried that I would lack for opportunities to Call the Bankroll, and as I've demonstrated over the past few months, there are countless opportunities to Call the Bankroll about efforts to influence legislation before this body. 
   For example, so far I have talked about the contributions of special interests working to influence the debate over the Patients' Bill of Rights, I have discussed the contributions of the high tech industry and trial lawyers lobby during debate on the Y2K legislation, and I have pointed out the contributions of gun makers and gun control advocates during the juvenile justice debate, just to name a few. 
   And now we have before this body the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill. 
   During his state of the union address last January, the President called for the Justice Department to prepare a ``litigation plan'' against the tobacco companies to reclaim hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars spent through federal health-care programs such as Medicare to treat smoking-related illnesses. 
   But this bill does something quite different. The language in the committee report on the Commerce, State, Justice Bill attempts to grant immunity to the tobacco industry from any federal litigation. Instead of a litigation plan, this bill would create a protection plan for the tobacco companies. 
   I hope my colleagues in this body would agree that the Justice Department must be able to pursue litigation based on the law, and that we should do everything in our power to enable the department to enforce the law. 
   But the language currently in the committee report prevents the Justice Department from enforcing the law. So instead of a huge federal lawsuit, the tobacco industry will have immunity from federal litigation. It looks like the tobacco companies have really gotten what they wanted in this bill, Mr. President. 
   It's a fortunate turn of events for the tobacco companies, but based on the tobacco industry's track record of political donations and political clout, I can't say that it's surprising. 
   The nation's tobacco companies are some of the most generous political donors around today, Mr. President, including Philip Morris, which reigns as the largest single soft money donor of all time. During the 1997-1998 election cycle the tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco, Brown and Williamson, US Tobacco and the industry's lobbying arm, the Tobacco Institute, gave a combined $5.5 million dollars in soft money to the parties, and another $2.3 million in PAC money contributions to candidates. 
   I offer this information to my colleagues and to the public to paint a clearer picture of who is trying to influence the bill before us, and how they are using the campaign finance system--very successfully, I might add--to get what they want from this bill and this Congress.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a measure that will begin to restore to many dairy farmers throughout the nation, part of the market power they have lost in recent years. 
   Mr. President, on March 31 of this year, Secretary Glickman put forth the Department of Agriculture's final rule on the Federal Milk Marketing Order system. As many of you know, that proposal consolidated federal orders and made changes to various pricing formulas in current law.  
   As mandated in last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill, this new federal policy is scheduled to take effect no later than October 1, 1999. However, prior to October, this nation's farmers will put USDA's proposal to a referendum. Farmers will have the opportunity to vote on their futures. Or at least that is what is supposed to happen. 
   Mr. President, most farmers in the country won't actually get to vote on this, the most significant change in dairy policy in sixty years. Their dairy marketing cooperatives will cast their votes for them. 
   This procedure is called bloc voting and it is used all the time. Basically, a Cooperative's Board of Directors decides that, in the interest of time, bloc voting will be implemented for that particular vote. In the interest of time, but not always in the interest of their producer owner-members. 
   Mr. President, I do think that bloc voting can be a useful tool in some circumstances, but I have serious concerns about its use in the August referendum on USDA's plan. Farmers in Wisconsin and in other states tell me that they do not agree with their Cooperative's view on the upcoming vote. Yet, they have no way to preserve their right to make their single vote count. 
   After speaking to farmers and officials at USDA, I have learned that if a Cooperative bloc votes, individual members simply have no opportunity to voice opinions separately. That seems unfair when you consider what a monumental issue is at stake. Coops and their members do not always have identical interests. We shouldn't ask farmers to ignore that fact. 
   Mr. President, the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act of 1999 is simple and fair. It provides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its members a ballot if one or two or ten or all of the members chose to vote on their own. 
   This will in no way slow down the process at USDA; implementation of the final rule will proceed on schedule. Also, I do not expect that this would change the final outcome of the vote. Coops could still cast votes for their members who do not exercise their right to vote individually. And to the extent that coops represent farmers interest, farmers are likely to vote along with the coops, but whether they join the coops or not, farmers deserve the right to vote according to their own views. 
   I urge my colleagues to return just a little bit of power to America's farmers, and a little bit of pure democracy to the vote on the USDA plan which is sure to have such an impact on their future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act, a dairy bill without regional bias.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I come to the floor today to speak of the tragedy that struck the Kennedy family last Friday night. I offer my condolences to the Kennedy family, and in particular to my friend and colleague, Senator KENNEDY of Massachusetts, who has lost a beloved nephew. 
   My thoughts and prayers are with the Kennedy and Bessette families as they struggle to cope with the loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette. While we as a nation mourn the loss of a young man who had so much yet to offer the world, these families must suffer the private pain of the loss of their beloved brother or sisters, their children, their cousins, their friends. 
   The late John F. Kennedy was a genuine inspiration to me and so many of my generation. I am grateful for the hope and the direction that President Kennedy gave so many of us when we were young, and I know that in his own way John F. Kennedy, Jr., carried on his father's work to inspire young people to public service, or to otherwise serve the public good, throughout his lifetime. 
   There can perhaps be no comparison to the contributions the Kennedy family has made to our country, or the sacrifices the family has endured, and sadly continues to endure with the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. Like his father and his uncle Bobby, John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s life was cut tragically short, but like them he lived his life to the fullest, with the vigor and dedication that marks the Kennedy legacy. 
   Recently I had the honor of receiving the Profile in Courage Award from the late President Kennedy's family, and had the pleasure of meeting and spending time with John F. Kennedy, Jr. I was impressed by his kindness, his dignity, and the keen grasp of both politics and policy which he so often displayed as editor of George magazine. John reflected all the best hopes we have for our country, as did his father before him. 
   In a speech I gave at that time, I chose one of the many beautiful memorials I have heard about President Kennedy to express my own feelings. The following passage from Romeo and Juliet was previously used by Robert F. Kennedy himself at the 1964 Democratic convention to memorialize his brother:  
   and, when he shall die, 
   take him and cut him out in little stars, 
   And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
   That all the world will be in love with night 
   And pay no worship to the garish sun.  
   These words both pained and consoled us as we remembered John F. Kennedy then, and they do the same today as we mourn the loss of his son, John F. Kennedy, Jr. 
   Mr. President, again I offer my condolences to all those who have been affected by this tragedy. I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of increasing national and international importance. 
   Mr. President, encryption may not yet be the most common term in the American lexicon, but it may well affect every American as we progress in this Information Age. Encryption systems provide security to conventional and cellular telephone conversation, fax transmissions, local and wide area networks, personal computers, remote key entry systems, and radio frequency communication systems. As we become more reliant on these technologies, encryption becomes a more important application. 
   For these and other reasons, I come to the floor today to discuss my decision to cosponsor S. 798, the Promote Reliable Online Transactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade, or PROTECT Act. This bill pushes us toward a thoughtful debate on encryption policy. 
   I appreciate the efforts of the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, to push this important legislation forward. As the chairman knows all too well, balancing competing interests, regardless of issue, is a difficult, and often thankless, job. In this case, we must find an equitable balance between personal privacy, technological innovation and public safety. 
   The rapidly expanding global marketplace and our increasing reliance on new technology has resulted in the almost instantaneous transfer of consumer information. Bank information, medical records, and credit card purchases are transferred at lightning speed. But these transactions, and even browsing on the Internet, can leave consumers vulnerable to unwanted and illegal access to private information. Encryption technology offers an effective way consumers can ensure that only the people they choose can read other communications or their e-mail, review their medical records, or take money out of their bank accounts. Plain and simple, encryption products protect consumers. 
   Over the past couple of years, we have seen the power of Internet commerce. From amazon.com to eBay to drugstore.com, companies with a dot com have become the darlings of the investment world. For consumers, online commerce provides viable competition and, thus, a cost-effective alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar stores. 
   The Internet, however, will never achieve its full potential as a center of commerce if consumers do not trust that their transactions and communications remain confidential. If we ever are to realize the commercial and communications potential of the Internet, we must have sophisticated and effective encryption. 
   For these precise reasons, consumers have an economic interest in the use of strong encryption technology. That economic interest necessitates more research and more development of stronger technology. The current export control climate, however, stifles development of domestic encryption technology. I believe that expansion of the market for U.S. developers will serve to quicken the pace of innovation. 
   Two recent reports bear this out. The Electronic Privacy Information Center found that the United States is virtually alone in its restrictions on encryption. Another report by researchers at George Washington University found that 35 foreign countries manufacture 805 encryption products. The same GWU report found that of the 15 algorithms now being considered by the National Institute of Standards for a new American encryption standard, 10 have been developed outside the U.S. Clearly, our outdated policies are doing more to exclude U.S. manufacturers from the marketplace than they are doing to keep encryption technology out of the hands of criminals. 
   I do not mean to belittle the serious law enforcement implications of encryption. As the FBI has stated, ``encryption has been used to conceal criminal activity and thwart law enforcement efforts to collect critical evidence needed to solve serious and often violent criminal activities.'' The same technology that prevents a computer hacker from stealing one's credit card number can prevent a law enforcement officer, even one with a properly  obtained court order, from decrypting illegal information. 
   But the fact of the matter is that criminals simply can purchase and use an advanced encryption product produced in a foreign country. I understand concerns that some in the law enforcement community may have. Muzzling American development and export, however, is a doomed strategy. I believe there should be criminal penalties for those that use encryption in the furtherance of a crime and I hope the Senate will adopt penalties similar to those found in the leading House encryption bill. 
   Mr. President, there is no question that this bill moves us forward, both in terms of privacy and technological innovation. I must point out, however, that my support for this bill will not preclude me from advocating a stronger privacy position in the future. My cosponsorship of this bill establishes what I believe should be the starting point for the Congress to begin the encryption debate. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this very important issue. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I rise today in opposition to the President's decision to extend normal trade relations status to China. 
   I especially thank the Senator from New Hampshire for bringing up the issue today. 
   I have objected to the President's policy on this issue since 1994, when he first de-linked the issue of human rights from our trading policy in China. The argument made then was that trade privileges and human rights are not interrelated. At the same time, it was said, through ``constructive engagement'' on economic matters, and dialogue on other issues, including human rights, the United States could better influence the behavior of the Chinese Government. 
   I have yet to see persuasive evidence that closer economic ties alone are going to transform China's authoritarian system into a democracy, or even reduce the current level of oppression borne by the Chinese people. Unless we continue to press the case for improvement in China's human rights record, using the leverage of the Chinese Government's desire to expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see how U.S. policy can help conditions in China get much better. 
   Virtually every review of the behavior of China's Government demonstrates that not only has there been little improvement in the human rights situation in China, but in many cases, it has worsened--particularly in the weeks preceding the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4th. More generally, five years after the President's decision to de-link trade from human rights, the State Department's most recent Human Rights Report on China describes once more an abysmal situation. 
   In my view, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion except that ``constructive engagement'' has failed to make any change in Beijing's human rights behavior. I would say that the evidence justifies the exact opposite conclusion: respect for human rights by the Chinese government has deteriorated and the regime continues to act recklessly in other areas vital to U.S. national interest. 
   This year--1999--is likely to be the most important year since 1989 with respect to our relations with China. Not only does it represent a significant milestone for the victims of Tiananmen Square, but 1999 is also the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. This year has also seen the emergence of new thorny issues between the United States and China, including the accidental embassy bombing, faltering negotiations 
   regarding accession to the World Trade Organizations, and the recent release of the Cox report on Chinese espionage. 
   If moral outrage at blatant abuse of human rights is not reason enough for a tough stance with China--and I believe it is, as do the American people--then let us do so on grounds of real political and economic self-interest. 
   For example, China has failed to provide adequate protection of U.S. intellectual property rights; it has employed broad and pervasive trade and investment barriers to restrict our exports; it has made illegal textile transshipments to the United States; it has exported products to the United States manufactured by prison labor; and it has engaged in questionable economic and political policies toward Hong Kong. 
   This does not present a picture of a nation with which we should have normal trade relations. Alternatively, if the Administration accepts these practices as normal, perhaps we need to redefine what normal trade relations are. The current practices are certainly not any that I wish to accept as normal. 
   Nor, Mr. President, do I wish to accept as normal the practice in our country of using campaign money to influence policy decisions, but I'm afraid that the China/NTR decision is far from an exception to this rule. 
   No, Mr. President, U.S.-China trade policy epitomizes how our campaign finance system can influence important decisions. The corporations and associations lobbying in favor of China NTR, as well as on China's accession to the World Trade Organization, represent a virtual who's who of major political donors. In an effort to inform my colleagues and the public about who's who in the push for NTR for China, I'd like to Call the Bankroll on some of the companies and associations involved in this fight. 
   These big donors represent industries that run the gamut of American commerce--from agribusiness to telecommunications and everything in between--but they all have in common a keen financial interest in China winning normal trade relations status.  
   One of the major coalitions lobbying to boost China's trade status, USA Engage, has a membership list brimming with top PAC money and soft money donors. 
   Let me name just a few examples of the political donations some of these USA Engage members gave during the last election cycle: 
   Defense contractor TRW Inc. gave more than $195,000 in soft money and $236,000 in PAC money. 
   Financial services giant BankAmerica gave more than $347,000 in soft money and more than $430,000 in PAC money. 
   The powerful business coalition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave nearly $50,000 in soft money and $10,000 in PAC money 
   Exxon, one of the world's largest oil companies, gave $331,000 in soft money and nearly half a million dollars in PAC money. 
   Communications giant Motorola gave more than $100,000 in both soft money and PAC money. 
   Mr. President, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The list goes on and the money is piled high. 
   Over in the other body, junior members--who of course sit in the most remote offices in the far corners of the House office buildings--say that the only reason corporate CEOs come visit their offices is to push for NTR status for China. 
   So you see, Mr. President, on the one hand, some of the most powerful interests in America come to our offices to call on us to grant NTR status to China. We hear them loud and clear, and more than that we know too well the influence they wield as a result of their political donations. 
   But Mr. President, what about the other side? What about the voices we don't hear? The faces we don't see? I am talking about the human rights organizations who oppose de-linking trade from human rights, but are virtually nonexistent in the world of campaign contributions. I am talking about the thousands, if not millions, of Chinese people living without basic human rights who don't have access to the Halls of Congress. 
   I fail to see anything normal about the United States extending favorable trading status to a government that routinely denies basic freedoms--of expression, of religion, and association--to its people. 
   I fail to see what is normal, what is acceptable, or what is just about the United States tacitly condoning the actions of a country where our own State Department reports that the human rights situation is--quote--``abysmal.'' 
   Mr. President, my main objective today is to push for the United States to once again make the link between human rights and trading relations with respect to our policy in China. As I have said before, I believe that trade--embodied by the peculiar exercise of NTR renewal--is one of the most powerful levers we have, and that it was a mistake for the President to de-link this exercise from human rights considerations. 
   So, Mr. President, for those of us who care about human rights, those of us who long for freedom of religion for others, and those of us who believe America should demonstrate moral leadership in the world, I urge colleagues to join me in disapproving the President's decision to renew normal-trade-relations status for China.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank the majority leader for his cooperation on this. I will ask a brief question. I want it to be absolutely clear in the record that the agreement as it reads involves a limitation with regard to the first session of the 106th Congress, but that we are not precluded in any way from raising this issue again in the second session of the 106th Congress.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, absolutely, and there are other things on which I would like to be working. 
   That is a good lead-in for my comments on this issue. Again, I thank the majority leader and the Senator from Kentucky for their remarks. I especially thank the Senator from Arizona for his tremendous persistence on this issue and especially in working out this agreement in the middle of a very busy legislative schedule that I know we have for the rest of the year. 
   This agreement involves a debate to come up by October 12. It is later than I would have wanted. I understand we have had a few other things going on, including an impeachment trial, the war in Kosovo, and so on, but it is essential that this matter be seriously considered. I hope it is resolved and that we pass legislation before the end of this year. In any event, we have to bring it up. 
   The word ``amendments'' is critical in this agreement. We have to have a real amending process. We have not had that yet on campaign finance reform. At no point, since I have been 
   working on the McCain-Feingold bill, have we ever had a time when Senators could offer their amendments about what they care about. Somehow, the process has always been truncated, and you can blame either side. Obviously, I have my view of it. But to me this agreement means that we will not again have a one-cloture-vote-and-we-are-done process. We are going to have real amendments, real debate, and a real discussion. If that transpires, I have a feeling we will have an outcome that, in my view, can lead to 60 or 70 votes, something on which Members on both sides can agree. That is my goal, and I think that is the goal of my colleague from Arizona. 
   I think it is very important to stay in touch with what happened in the other body. They have passed this legislation. A majority of Members of both Houses of the Congress are for this, and the President is ready to sign it. 
   I think it is important to make those points. Although it has its limitations, this can be the beginning of truly reaching some kind of an agreement in this House to do something about the incredible explosion of soft money that has tainted our democracy. 
   So, again, I thank the majority leader, and I am looking forward to this process.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help clarify the difficult subject of the use of offsets in international defense trade. This little known practice has a potentially tremendous impact on our domestic industry, international trade, and national security, yet is barely understood by either the public or private sectors. My bill, the ``Defense Offsets Disclosure Act of 1999'' seeks to expand the monitoring and reporting of offsets use so that policy makers and the public can better understand the impact on our economy. 
   Mr. President, what are offsets? Offsets are the entire range of industrial and commercial benefits that are provided to foreign governments as inducements, or conditions, for the purchase of military goods and services. Among techniques used to meet offset requirements are co-production, subcontracting, technology transfers, in-country procurement, marketing and financial assistance, and joint ventures. In other words, they are largely non-cash ``sweeteners'' attached to export sales of large military [and occasionally civilian] products, typically set forth in side agreements and provided to the purchasing country over a period of time. 
   My legislation would offer several measures to get a handle on the whole range of issues involved in the use of offsets: 
   First, my bill declares that it is the policy of the United States to pursue better monitoring of offsets, to promote fairness in international trade; and to ensure an appropriate level of foreign participation in the production of United States weapons systems. To fully understand the implications of offsets and the extent of their impact, we must have more information on offset agreements, particularly the indirect offset obligations that are otherwise invisible. While many of my colleagues can cite anecdotal evidence of companies harmed or jobs lost, we must develop a more effective mechanism to accurately quantify the impact of offsets. 
   Second, my bill expresses the sense of Congress that the Executive Branch should seek trade fairness through transparency and standardization of the use of offsets in international defense trade. In particular, the Secretaries of State and Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative should raise the issues of transparency and standardization bilaterally at all suitable venues, and our government should initiate discussions on standards for use of offsets through appropriate multilateral fora. While some believe that offsets are a business practice best left to business to handle, the nature of the problem calls out for government-to-government discussion to ensure that an even playing field exists for all stakeholders in the international defense trade. 
   Third, the bill establishes a new requirement for more detailed information on offsets in Congressional notifications of government-to-government and commercial sales. Current law only requires notification of the existence of an offset agreement, with no details or follow up description of the measures used to fulfill the offset obligation. My bill will require a description of the offset agreement and its dollar value. It also calls for an additional report upon completion of an offset obligation which would identify all measures taken to fulfill the offset agreement identified earlier in its pre-sale Congressional notification. At least one defense contractor already has been willing to provide this information as part of its regular license application and has provided the size of the offset, its direct and indirect components, and a rough estimate of the likely measures it would use to fulfill its offset obligations. My bill should elicit similar useful information on all offset agreements. 
   Fourth, the bill expands a prohibition on incentive payments that I authored in 1993. That earlier provision prohibited the use of third party incentive payments to secure offset agreements in any sale subject to the Arms Export Control Act. My new bill expands the prohibition to include items ``exported'' or ``licensed''. The previous language addressed only ``sales''. The incentive payments provision in my bill should close any loopholes and clarify that incentive payments are not an acceptable component of any type of offset transaction. 
   Fifth, the bill requires the Administration to initiate a review to determine the feasibility, and the most effective means, of negotiating multilateral agreements on standards for the use of offsets. It also mandates a report on the Administration's activities in the area. Through international dialogue and coordination we can arrive at multilateral standards for the use of offsets in defense trade agreements. Whether you believe that offsets are merely an annoying, but ordinary, business practice, or hold the view that they pose a major long term threat to our labor force, our industries, and our national security, I believe it is both possible and necessary to develop some common ground for business practices worldwide. 
   Sixth, the bill requires the President to establish a high-level, nonpartisan commission to review the full range of current practices; the impact of the use of offsets; and the role of offsets in domestic industry, trade competitiveness, national security, and the globalization of the weapons industry. There needs to be broader public awareness and national debate by a range of concerned parties on the implications of offsets. A June 29 hearing on offsets in the House Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy, and Human Resources, at which I testified, was a good start, but more still must be done. 
   Mr. President, I first discovered the murky world of offsets in 1993 when I learned that the Wisconsin-based Beloit Corporation, a subsidiary of Harnischfeger Industries Inc., had been negatively affected by an apparent indirect offset arrangement between the Northrop Corporation and the government of Finland. Beloit was one of only three companies in the world that produced a particular type of large paper-making machine. In its efforts to sell one of these machines to the International Paper Company, Beloit became aware that Northrop had offered International Paper an incentive payment to select instead the machine offered by a Finnish company, Valmet. Northrop was promoting the purchase of the Valmet machinery as part of an agreement that would provide dollar-for-dollar offset credit on a deal with Finland to purchase sixty-four F-18 aircraft. This type of payment had the flavor of a kickback, distorted the practice of free enterprise, and threatened U.S. jobs. By lowering its bid--barely breaking even on the contract--to take into account the incentive payment offered by Northrop, Beloit did succeed in winning the contract. Nevertheless, the incident demonstrated to me the potential for offset obligations to have an impact on apparently unrelated domestic U.S. industries. 
   To address some of the immediate concerns raised by Beloit's experience, as I mentioned earlier, in 1993 I offered an amendment (which passed into law in 1994), to the Arms Export Control Act to prohibit incentive payments in the provision of offset credit. I wanted to clarify the Congress' disapproval of an activity that appeared to fall through the cracks of various existing acts. Neither the Anti-Kickback Act nor the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act seemed clearly to address issues raised by the payment being offered to International Paper in the Beloit case. The measure also expanded the requirements for Congressional notification of the existence, and to the extent possible, information on any offset agreement at the time of Congressional notification of a pending arms sale under the Arms Export Control Act. Last year, I offered additional language to expand further the prohibition on incentive payments and enhance the reporting requirement on offsets to include a description of the offset with dollar amounts. While my provisions were incorporated in the Security Assistance Act of 1998 as passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the legislation never made it to the floor.  
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, while Congress has tried to address specific problems encountered by companies in our states and districts, efforts to date have barely scratched the surface of the difficult subject of offsets. In fact, neither the legislative nor the executive branches has a full grasp of the breadth and complexity of the issue, although I know many are concerned about the potential impact of the use of offsets. From what we do know, it appears that there are several key areas affected by the practice of using offsets: 
   The domestic labor force and defense industrial base, particularly in the aerospace industry, impacted by the increasing role of overseas production in the defense industry; 
   The non-defense industrial sectors unintentionally harmed, as in the Beloit case, when defense contractors engage in indirect offset obligations; 
   The breadth of the U.S. economy potentially influenced by the growing globalization of the defense industry; and 
   The national security possibly threatened by joint ventures and growing reliance on foreign defense contractors, a concern recently highlighted in the Cox report on China's technology acquisition. 
   Mr. President, I believe my bill will allow us to collect better information on the use of offsets, to engage in an informed discussion on both the problem and viable policy options, and to encourage multilateral efforts to find common standards and solutions that will benefit us all. Only through these efforts can we hope to get a clear picture of the complex offset issue and ensure that their use does not produce negative consequences for the American labor force, the domestic industrial base, or our national security.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance of passing a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights package that will ensure that managed care companies cannot put their cost-control measures ahead of the well-being of their patients. This legislation is absolutely vital to protecting the quality of health care for all Americans. 
   Many of my colleagues have spoken on various aspects of this issue over the past few weeks. But I would like to bring my colleagues' statements ``home'' by speaking a bit about what we mean when we talk about ``Protecting Patients' Rights.'' We are talking about the grim reality that the American health care system is no longer controlled by those who best understand how to treat patients--our physicians. 
   Instead, managed care companies, primarily HMOs but also other health insurance providers, have become so involved in the business of health care that they control nearly every aspect of health care including where the health care is provided, and by whom. Of greatest concerns to me the most is that these managed care organizations can decide whether that health care can be provided at all--they make the key medical decisions. In other words,, regardless of whether that care is determined to be medically necessary by the physician who is treating you, managed care administrators can override your doctor's medical decisions and refuse to cover the care that you need. 
   How does this happen? Well, managed care companies control costs by limiting supply--screening which health care providers its enrollees are permitted to see, requiring patients to go through insurance company gatekeepers prior to seeing a specialist, tracking physician practice patterns to ensure that doctors are complying with HMOs' cost-control efforts. Some HMOs go so far as to impose a gag-rule on doctors, prohibiting physicians in their system from discussing treatment options that the HMO administrators deem too expensive. 
   Managed care companies control how--or even whether--we receive health care. Their control over what goes on in the examination room can be matched only by their significant political clout in Washington, which they've gained in part through generous political donations. Mr. President, during earlier remarks I gave on the Patients' Bill of Rights, I talked about the power special interests wield in the health care debate, but I want to remind my colleagues and the public of those remarks, because I think it's vital that we keep the power of these wealthy interests in mind throughout this discussion. 
   During the last election cycle, managed care companies and their affiliated groups spent more than $3.4 million on soft money contributions, PAC, and individual contributions--roughly double what they spent during the last mid-term elections. 
   Managed care giant United HealthCare Corporation gave $305,000 in soft money to the parties, and $65,500 in PAC 
   money to candidates; 
   Blue Cross/Blue Shield's national association gave more than $200,000 in soft money and nearly $350,000 in PAC money; 
   And the managed care industry's chief lobby, the American Association of Health Plans, has given nearly $60,000 in soft money in the last two years. 
   Mr. President, these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg, but I mention them today to present a clearer picture of the power the managed care industry wields in Washington as we debate managed care reform. As we talk here on the floor about why Americans have such an important stake in this body passing the Patients' Bill of Rights, we should also be aware of what a huge stake the industry has in stopping this legislation, and how they have used the campaign finance system to protect their interests. 
   Regardless of how you feel about any particular Patients' Bill of Rights proposal, I think any reasonable person would agree that an arrangement where someone has financial incentives to deny health care to my family and me--that the very existence of such incentives has to raise flags. As a parent, and as a consumer, I want to be sure that managed care cost-control systems don't compromise the quality of health care for my family and me. 
   So I want to make it clear that the central goal of protecting patients' rights is to ensure that medical necessity is what drives our health care. That's what we're talking about. We need to be sure that the people making health care decisions are licensed health care professionals, not administrative personnel whose primary mission is to protect their bottom line. I do not think that is an outrageous, pie-in-the-sky goal. I think it's a common sense expectation when I buy health insurance for my family, and I don't think any of my colleagues would demand any less from their own health insurance. 
   During the year or so since Senators DASCHLE and KENNEDY first introduced the Patients' Bill of Rights, I have had the opportunity to visit every county in my state to speak with my constituents and to find out what issues they care about. I can tell you that health care--the quality of health care, the availability of health care--is consistently one of the top issues that my constituents raise with me. In general, the quality of health care in Wisconsin is quite good. Wisconsin was one of the first states to regulate HMOs as insurance providers, and the state has developed a set of basic, common sense patient protections--many of which are included in S. 6, the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Mr. President, I would like to share a story that was told to me by a pediatrician who practices in Madison, Wisconsin. This pediatrician told me about a newborn infant she saw who looked 
   fine upon first examination, but on the second day, the pediatrician detected a heart murmur. Knowing that this newborn urgently needed to see a specialist, the pediatrician immediately called for a referral to a pediatric cardiologist, which in this particular HMO requires first going through an adult cardiologist for the referral to a pediatric specialist. By sheer luck, a pediatric cardiologist happened to be in the hospital on a separate matter and was able to examine the baby. 
   The pediatric cardiologist ordered an echocardiogram and diagnosed coarctation, a tightening or narrowing of the aorta that is specific to newborns. That pediatric cardiologist happened to be in the right place at the right time--but under usual circumstances, time would have been lost while a referral was sought from an adult cardiologist. As a result, that baby immediately began receiving medication--prostaglandin--intravenously until she could be transported to Children's Hospital in Milwaukee to receive emergency heart surgery. The baby survived and is doing well. 
   When I heard this story, apart from relief that the baby survived, my first question was, ``What would have happened if you and the baby's parents had to go through the normal processes of the HMO's rules?'' The pediatrician told me that that process, even if expedited, would have taken at least 24 hours, which didn't sound very long until the pediatrician informed me that the untreated coarctation would have resulted in the baby's death within a few hours. 
   I am greatly relieved and happy that this particular baby was cared for and survived. But what I find frightening, though, is that this baby survived almost as a fluke, in spite of the system. The Patients' Bill of Rights includes a guarantee of access to pediatric specialists. Fortunately for the family of  the baby with the heart murmur, many pieces fell into place to save the baby, including a dedicated and vigilant pediatrician willing to be an advocate for her patient and a pediatric specialist in the right place at the right time. This situation didn't turn into a horror story. But we simply cannot let these sorts of happy endings happen only by chance. We must enact meaningful patient protections, such as guaranteed access to pediatric specialists as contained in the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights but lacking in the Republican bill, to ensure that people get the care that they need. 
   The patient protections we are talking about ought to be part of the deal when you enroll in health insurance. These are pretty basic concerns, Mr. President, concerns that I think may get obscured sometimes when we get into jargon like ``prudent layperson,'' ``point of service,'' and so on. So when we speak about protecting patients' rights, I want to be clear that we are talking about how to make sure that corporate cost-control concerns don't result in people being denied the care that they need. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague Senator JAMES JEFFORDS of Vermont on legislation he introduced that makes several important first steps in addressing some serious access problems in the Medicare home health care program. Senator JEFFORDS' legislation, the Preserving Access to Care in the Home (PATCH) Act of 1999, contains several important provisions to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have access to home health services. 
   Mr. President, I have been working to promote the availability of home care and long-term care options for my entire public life. I believe it is vitally important that we in Congress work to enable people to stay in their own homes. Ensuring the availability of home health services is integral to preserving independence, dignity and hope for some of our frailest and most vulnerable fellow Americans. I feel strongly that where there is a choice, we should do our best to allow patients to choose home health care. I think Seniors need and deserve that choice. I applaud Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership on this issue, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that Seniors have access to the care that they need.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to honor one of our former colleagues, Jim Sasser, who today completes his term as United States Ambassador to China. 
   I was honored to serve with Jim Sasser during my first two years as a member of this body. He served the people of Tennessee with distinction. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I was pleased to support his nomination to be our Ambassador to China both in Committee and on the Senate floor. Although I have serious concerns about United States policy toward China, I believe that Ambassador Sasser served this country admirably during a period of immense strain in the complex relationship between the two countries. 
   In particular, he displayed enormous poise and courage in the days that followed the unfortunate, tragic, and accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. For more than four days, Ambassador Sasser and numerous staff members were literally trapped inside the United States embassy in Beijing as thousands of demonstrators chanted anti-American slogans and threw rocks at the embassy from the streets outside. I commend him for the calm and diplomatic manner in which he dealt with this tense situation. He reminded us that ambassadors are more than just the official representatives of the United States; they are also the chiefs of mission with responsibility for the staff of many U.S. agencies, as well as the responsibility for the safety of American citizens living or traveling in the countries in which they serve. Our former colleague carried out all of these functions admirably under difficult conditions. 
   I wish Ambassador Sasser well in his future endeavors.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to S. 606, a bill for the Relief of Global Exploration and Development Corporation, Kerr-McGee and Kerr-McGee Chemical, offered by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator KOHL. In 1954, Congress enacted ``termination'' legislation eliminating the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin's federal trust status. At that time, the Menominee Tribe was ill-prepared to function outside of the federal trust system. The Tribe's lack of readiness became quickly apparent when, upon termination, the Tribe was plunged into years of severe impoverishment and community turmoil. Today, with this amendment, we seek to provide redress for some of that severe turmoil, and the mismanagement of tribal resources in the period following the enactment of termination legislation. 
   I am pleased that this issue is finally being resolved, in part. This Menominee Settlement claim has been an active issue throughout my tenure in the Senate. In the five years since the original legislative reference was referred by the Senate to the Court of Claims, the tribe and the federal government have engaged in extensive litigation and negotiation. Following documentation and negotiations by both sides, the United States, represented by the Department of Justice, and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin agreed upon a settlement of the claims of the Tribe for a sum of $32,052,547, subject to passage of the necessary legislation by Congress. This amendment will legislatively complete that settlement. 
   This settlement cannot undo the suffering of the Menominee people. The reservation, the boundaries of which are entirely co-terminous with the boundaries of Menominee County, is acknowledged to be still experiencing some of the most significant levels of poverty and economic dislocation in my entire state. The compensation for the lack of management of forestry and other reservation resources provided in this settlement, though it cannot undo the past, can help the Menominee Nation to seek a bright future. I know the Menominee Nation looks forward to assisting its people and the surrounding communities through the use of these funds. 
   In conclusion, I also want to acknowledge the leadership of my colleague from Wisconsin on this issue. He has taken on significant responsibility in seeking to right this wrong and I commend him for it. Thank you.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, to offer this amendment to encourage a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. This amendment closely mirrors what he and I and several other Senators expressed in Senate Resolution 96, and in a similar amendment to the State Department authorization bill. We are offering this amendment today to again highlight the significance of the process underway in East Timor that will once and for all determine its political status. 
   I want to commend the members of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for including language relating to East Timor in the committee report accompanying this bill. I believe it is important that the Senate go on record regarding its support for the forthcoming ballot and in condemnation of the violence surrounding this historic vote. 
   As we all know, Indonesian President Habibie announced on January 27 that the Government of Indonesia was finally willing to seek to learn and respect the wishes of the people in that territory. On May 5, the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal signed an  agreement to hold a United Nations- supervised ``consultation'' on August 8 to determine East Timor's future political status. This ballot has since been postponed to an as yet undetermined date in late August. 
   Despite the positive step forward that the ballot represents, excitement and tension over the possibility of gaining independence have in recent months led to a gross deterioration of the security situation. Militias, comprised of individuals determined to intimidate the East Timorese people into support for continued integration with Indonesia and widely believed to be supported by the Indonesian military, are responsible for a sharp increase in violence. 
   Just this week, members of a pro-Jakarta civilian militia attacked a United Nations regional headquarters in the Maliana township in East Timor. Several people, including a U.N. election officer, were wounded. This is latest in a string of violent incidents that have been linked to pro-Jakarta militias. Mr. President, this kind of violence and intimidation cannot be tolerated, especially at this crucial time. 
   In the May 5 agreement, the Government of Indonesia agreed to take responsibility for ensuring that the ballot is carried out in a fair and peaceful way. Unfortunately, it is unclear that they are implementing this aspect of the agreement. Quite the opposite. Whether Indonesian troops have actually participated in some of these incidents or not, the authorities certainly most accept the blame for allowing, and in some cases encouraging, the bloody tactics of the pro-integration militias. The continuation of this violence is a threat to the very sanctity and legitimacy of the process that is underway. Thus, the Leahy-Feingold amendment specifically calls on Jakarta to do all it can to seek a peaceful process and a fair resolution to the situation in East Timor. 
   Mr. President, I believe the United States has a responsibility--an obligation--to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian government to help encourage an environment conducive to a free, fair, peaceful ballot process for the people of East Timor. I am pleased that we have taken a leadership role in offering technical, financial, and diplomatic support to the recently authorized U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor, known as UNAMET. 
   Mr. President, it is not in our power to guarantee the free, fair exercise of the rights of the people of East Timor to determine their future. It is, however, in our interest to do all that we can to work with the United Nations, other concerned countries, the government of Indonesia and the people of East Timor to create an opportunity for a successful ballot process. We cannot forget that the Timorese have been living with violence and oppression for more than 23 years. These many years have not dulled the desire of the East Timorese for freedom, or quieted their demands to have a role in the determination of East Timor's status. 
   We have to do all we can to support an environment that can produce a fair ballot in East Timor. Now. And throughout the rest of this process. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, (Mr. BROWNBACK), the so-called ``Silk Road Strategy Act.'' I certainly support the Senator's desire to promote peace and democracy in Central Asia and the South Caucasus region, but I remain concerned about the approach this legislation takes toward achieving these laudable goals. 
   In particular, I am troubled by the provision in the Silk Road Strategy Act which would allow the President to waive Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Section 907 prohibits United States assistance to the government of Azerbaijan until it takes demonstrable steps to end the blockade of Nagorno-Karabakh. No such steps have been taken, Mr. President. The blockade continues, as do human rights violations against the Armenian population in the region. I am concerned that the waiver of Section 907 would, in effect, reward the Azeri government for its refusal to end the blockade. 
   For those reasons, I opposed prior versions of the Silk Road Strategy Act in the Committee on Foreign Relations in the 105th and 106th Congresses, and I signed on to the minority views contained in the committee report both times. Those views stated, in part, that ``to waive [Section 907] in the absence of any progress toward a lifting of the blockade would reward the Government of Azerbaijan for its intransigence and remove a major incentive for good-faith negotiation from one side in the conflict.'' 
   Mr. President, a decision not to provide foreign assistance to a government is not a sanction. The United States Congress has the responsibility to prohibit the provision of bilateral assistance to governments with which we have serious concern. This is not a sanction; rather, it is a means of making our foreign policy goals clear. Foreign assistance is not an entitlement. Section 907 plainly states that there will be no U.S. assistance to the government of Azerbaijan until the blockade is lifted. Period. As my colleagues well recall, this body has placed numerous conditions on bilateral assistance to a variety of countries. Section 907 is a condition, not a sanction. Moreover, many types of bilateral assistance are exempt from Section 907, and U.S. trade with Azerbaijan has been unaffected by this provision. 
   I will support the McConnell-Abraham second degree amendment to strike the waiver authority for Section 907 from the bill, and I will oppose the Brownback amendment in its current form. I urge my colleagues to do so as well.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for their work on this legislation. This is not an easy bill. 
   I certainly commend their efforts to keep this bill within the budget caps. I regret that in trying to balance our many important priorities, international affairs spending may have suffered disproportionately. 
   Mr. President, national security can not be viewed solely through a defense lens, but also must comprise all the critical preventive measures offered through an active foreign affairs program. This means continuing to fight the spread of disease and drugs, providing adequate nutrition for children and families, and pursuing U.S. goals in arms reduction. We also should continue to make our full contributions to the multilateral institutions, in particular the United Nations, on which the United States relies. 
   I will, however, support this legislation. 
   However, I do wish to comment on one area of funding in particular which has suffered cuts in this legislation, and that is international peacekeeping. This bill appropriates funds for America's voluntary peacekeeping activities, which includes such things as our contributions to the Israel-Lebanon Monitoring Group, to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and to the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) in the Middle East. The voluntary peacekeeping account also funds our contributions to important peacekeeping initiatives in Africa, including through an Africa regional fund and through the Africa Crisis Response Initiative. 
   But Mr. President, this bill would cut the voluntary peacekeeping account by $50 million off the President's request; that's 40% below the request. While the bill would support a slight increase from last year's appropriation for this account, I am afraid that this level is inadequate to support our peacekeeping efforts in Africa. 
   This voluntary peacekeeping fund is designed to support peacekeeping efforts other than assessed missions by the United Nations, which are funded separately through an account in another appropriations bill. The account funded in this bill is designed to try to anticipate needs in the peacekeeping arena, but also to be flexible and prepared to deal with unanticipated contingencies. 
   This morning, the chairman of the Subcommittee, the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky, made the assertion that the administration's request regarding peacekeeping was, in his words, ``redundant,'' because there is more than one account that provides funds for peacekeeping in Africa. 
   But, Mr. President, I would respectfully disagree with this characterization and note that the requirements for peacekeeping in Africa are such that a distinct account may be required. 
   At a recent hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, Chairman FRIST and I heard testimony regarding the conflict raging in Central Africa, in which there are currently as many as nine countries involved. These wars don't get much press attention in the United States, but it is likely that more people are dying there right now than we have seen killed in Kosovo in recent months and in a number of other well publicized conflicts outside Africa. 
   Mr. President, it is easy to make generalizations about the causes of conflict in Africa, but I think its roots are not well understood. 
   At that hearing, I posed some important questions which I would like to repeat here on the floor. 
   First, what is the basis for U.S. policy in Africa? Is it to support democracy and respect for human rights? Is it to avoid genocide? Is it to encourage stability and economic development? These are some of the things I hear administration officials saying, but sometimes I am not sure our actions are consistent with these lofty goals. For example, some would question how the United States government hopes to prevent genocide, when it is often hesitant to condemn atrocities that fall short of genocide. Some also question our commitment to preventing genocide in the future when our government has so far declined to examine in any detail our own weak response during the 1994 crisis. 
   Second, if there were to be another ``genocide''--assuming there is consensus as to the meaning of that word--what steps is the United States prepared to take to stop it? Is NATO going to start launching air strikes against the offending powers? We all know that is unrealistic, yet the crisis in Kosovo is causing a lot of people--including Members of Congress and including myself--to ask: ``Why Kosovo and not Rwanda?'' Why is it 
   that the United States can spend billions of dollars trying to stop ethnic cleansing in one place, but yet wouldn't even use the word ``genocide'' in the Rwanda case until two months after the killing started, and thousands had been killed? 
   The distinguished chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, the Senator from Kentucky, also noted the Committee's intent to have Serbia designated as a terrorist state, which is mandated in the legislation. I support this designation, and I agree with my colleague that it is hard to understand  the difference, as he said this morning on the floor, ``between thugs blowing up a village with a car bomb or thugs shelling and burning a village to the ground. The intent and impact are the same. In both instances, innocent civilians are the targets and the victims.'' 
   Mr. President, this is precisely my point. Only I would make this point with respect to Africa and say this: I do not understand the difference between the terror and violence that is going on in Sierra Leone and what is going on in Kosovo! In both instances, innocent civilians are the targets and the victims. Yet the bill before us today provides millions of dollars to support peacekeeping and other activities for Kosovo, and barely anything for similar activities in Africa. 
   I do not understand how the decision to intervene in Kosovo fits in with an overall post-Cold War American foreign policy strategy. Obviously, the tragedies and the horrors that have been perpetrated in Kosovo demand a response and that response must include a role for the United States. But as the world's only superpower, I do not believe the United States is able to act effectively only in Europe or only in our own region. We have shown our ability to project overwhelming power throughout the world. Is an accident of geography sufficient to allow inaction in Africa, while Kosovo requires a huge commitment? This question needs to be answered not so much for me but for the American people, and to some extent for the people of Africa. They do not understand, and I do not understand, why one tragedy demands our attention and our action, and another one simply does not. 
   Mr. President, my point here is that, given the overwhelming response to the events in the Balkans, the very least we can do in response to conflict in Africa is to support regional peacekeeping efforts, as well as do all we can on the preventive side. 
   The United States has been a significant contributor to existing regional efforts such as the actions of the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, and its peacekeeping force, ECOMOG in both Liberia and in the ongoing conflict in Sierra Leone. There is no doubt that ECOMOG has had its share of problems, but nevertheless, it is solely through the efforts of this regional peacekeeping force that there is even the hope of a peaceful resolution in the Sierra Leone situation. 
   Mr. President, we can never truly anticipate the extent of needs such as this, and I would hope we could allow the administration some flexibility in this account. We should ensure the availability of funding to provide resources to support what I hope will be a peace agreement in Sierra Leone and maybe a cease-fire agreement in the conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. If these positive developments take place, the United States should be poised to provide some support. This is no time to send a signal that we are not concerned with these crises. 
   Finally, just a quick word about the two Africa-related portions of this voluntary account. As I understand his remarks, the Senator from Kentucky believes it is ``redundant'' to have both an Africa Regional fund and monies for the Africa Crisis Response Initiative. But in my view, these two funds serve two separate purposes. The first, the Africa regional fund, represents our traditional peacekeeping functions. This is the account that has been used to provide logistical assistance to ECOMOG in both the Liberia and Sierra Leone cases. The other, the Africa Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI), is different. ACRI seeks to assist African militaries to build their own capacities to conduct peacekeeping operations. It is hoped that countries which now receive training under ACRI would agree to participate in future peacekeeping operations. In this regard, ACRI represents a forward-leaning approach; call it ``preventive diplomacy.'' 
   Mr. President, ACRI has been in operation for just a short while and can still be considered in its early stage. Most of the militaries that have received training through ACRI have been trained at the company or, in a few cases, battalion levels, but an important aspect of the program is also to conduct brigade level training. As envisioned, the brigade level training is key to the whole ACRI program because it would expand joint training exercises between and among participating countries and would help ensure interoperability between and among the forces of contributing nations. 
   Mr. President, just as the ACRI program is getting underway, I do not think we should be cutting support for it. Our efforts to build peacekeeping capacity in Africa will fail if we can not assist in preparing our partners to actually participate and conduct peacekeeping operations. 
   In summary, Mr. President, I believe the voluntary peacekeeping account represents an important part of our international affairs funding, and of America's ability to lead in the world, and I am concerned that the cuts to this account will have an inordinate impact on Africa. 
   Mr. LAUTENBERG Mr. President, I rise today first of all to thank and commend the Chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee for their efforts to develop a bill to meet priority foreign affairs needs within the limits of the subcommittee allocation. 
   Mr. President, the Budget Resolution did not allocate sufficient resources for Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee frankly did not receive a sufficient allocation to maintain America's world leadership role We need to recognize that neither isolationism nor limited engagement is an option if we want to maintain America's security and prosperity. 
   We need to realize that we cannot conduct effective foreign policy solely by having a strong military In fact, by limiting funding for other tools of diplomacy we increase our reliance on threats and use of military force. 
   This bill fails to fulfill the President's request in numerous areas. 
   I am deeply concerned that the Wye aid package for Israel, the Palestinians, and Jordan requested by the President has not been fully funded The fact that it could not be accommodated within the subcommittee allocation without drastically cutting important programs around the world merely reinforces my previous point. 
   In the near future, we are going to have to step up to the responsibility of funding aid to help implement the Wye River Memorandum I hope the Chairman will agree that we will need to find a way to fund this aid outside the confines of this bill This is a small price to pay for continued and renewed efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. 
   The bill does not include the $60 million I sought for tuberculosis prevention programs We need much stronger programs to combat tuberculosis now Tuberculosis kills more people worldwide than AIDS and malaria combined, yet receives substantially fewer aid dollars. 
   TB is spread easily and each active case leads to many more, so concerted global action to bring TB under control, now estimated to require $1 billion, becomes more expensive the longer we wait We need to find more resources to begin to confront the challenge of TB this year. 
   I hope we will also be able to find an additional $20 million for the United Nations Development Program UNDP has made great strides in cutting costs and improving coordination among UN agencies in the field to more effectively deliver essential assistance and promote sustainable economic development. 
   Unfortunately, we're penalizing the poor in many countries by following the Administration's lead and failing to restore funding for UNDP to $100 million. 
   I am also concerned that the bill significantly underfunds debt relief for the poorest countries. 
   Funding for the Peace Corps is reduced from the requested level, when it should have been increased to make progress toward the President's goal of fielding ten thousand Peace Corps Volunteers. 
   Even counter terrorism programs have not been adequately funded. 
   Having raised these concerns, let me reiterate my commendation to the subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member for making a real effort to achieve a balanced bill while remaining within an allocation nearly $2 billion below the President's request. 
   I would also like to thank the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for including many important programs. In particular, Seeds of Peace contributes to reconciliation in the  Middle East by bringing together young people from throughout the region, including Israelis and Palestinians and other Arabs. 
   Carelift International, which is largely funded by the private sector, improves health care in transition and developing countries at low cost by sharing refurbished American medical equipment. 
   Senator MCCONNELL has also put some real dollars behind the rhetoric supporting regional integration in Southeast Europe. We need to aid the Kosovars to rebuild their shattered lives and help the countries and peoples of this troubled region to overcome their differences and their history and truly become a part of the new Europe. 
   I do hope we will be able to restore funding requested by the Administration for regional programs under the SEED Act, including programs to combat trans-national crime. 
   I am not offering amendments to increase allocations to unfunded or underfunded programs because I think it would be very difficult to do so without reducing funding for other priorities. 
   I voted for this bill in the subcommittee and committee because I think Senators MCCONNELL and LEAHY have done a good job with the limited resources available to them. I will likely vote for the bill in the Senate as well, but not without deep reservations about the overall funding level and priorities which have not been funded adequately. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on June 10, 1999 I joined as a co-sponsor of legislation introduced by my Midwestern colleagues, the Junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. VOINOVICH, and the Junior Senator from Indiana, Mr. BAYH, S. 872, The Municipal Solid Waste Interstate Transportation and Local Authority Act of 1999. I am pleased to be working with them on this very important issue. I know that they, as former Governors, are intimately aware of the concerns that the growing trash trade poses for the States we represent. 
   We in the Midwest, especially those of us fortunate enough to be from the Great Lakes States, enjoy a very high quality of life--beautiful scenery, small, neighborly towns, and spectacular natural resources. We hold it as a particular point of pride that we, in many instances, have the luxury of avoiding many environmental problems and we have structured our State and local governments in Wisconsin to try to be sure that we continue to avoid them. However, Mr. President, we in Wisconsin are unable to protect our communities, which have done a good regulatory job, from having to deal with the solid waste mess created by our neighboring communities in other States. Instead, my State has been forced to accept other States' municipal solid waste in ever increasing amounts. 
   We need to enact legislation to re-empower States to be able to control the flow of waste into state-licensed landfills from out-of-state sources. This legislation would give States the tools to do just that. It gives states, like mine, the power to freeze solid waste imports at the 1993 levels. States that did not accept out of State waste in 1993 would be presumed to prohibit receipt of out-of-State waste until the affected unit of local government approves it. Facilities that already have a host community agreement or permit that accepts out-of-State waste would remain exempt from the ban. States would also be allowed to set a State-wide percentage limit on the amount of waste that new or expanding facilities could accept. The limit can not be lower than 20 percent. Finally, States, under this bill, are also given the ability to deny the creation of either new facilities or the expansion of existing in-State facilities if it is determined that there is no in-State need for the new capacity. 
   My home State has tried to address this issue repeatedly on its own, without success. On January 25, 1999, a federal appeals court struck down as unconstitutional a 1997 Wisconsin law that prohibits landfills from accepting out-of-State waste from communities that don't recycle in compliance with Wisconsin's law. We are now examining options for limiting out-of-State trash in Wisconsin including: appealing the decision to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to hear an appeal of a similar Wisconsin case in 1995, passing new State legislation, or pursuing the option before us today--seeking specific authority from Congress to regulate trash from other States.  
   Wisconsin's law bans 15 different recyclables from State landfills. Under the law, communities using Wisconsin landfills must have a recycling program similar to those required of Wisconsin communities under Wisconsin law, regardless of the law in their home State. About 27 Illinois towns rely on southern Wisconsin landfills. Since the law took effect, waste haulers serving those communities have had to find alternative landfills for their clients, incurring higher transportation costs in the process. IL-based Waste Management Inc. and the 1,300-member National Solid Waste Management Association were the entities that challenged Wisconsin's law, arguing that the law violated the Interstate Commerce Clause. 
   By recycling, Wisconsin residents have reduced the amount of municipal waste heading to landfills. Since the State's previous out-of-State waste law was struck down by the appeals court in 1995, the amount of non-Wisconsin waste in Wisconsin landfills has tripled. When the law was in effect, 7.7 percent of the municipal waste in Wisconsin came from out of State. That has risen to more than 22.9 percent since the law was struck down. Though this legislation will not afford Wisconsin the ability to block garbage containing recyclables from our landfills, it will at least give my State the ability to address the overall volume of waste entering our State. 
   In 1995, I supported flow control legislation sponsored by the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. SMITH, and drawn substantially from the work of the former Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats. I have been shocked that the Senate, which passed that bill by a significant majority vote of 94-6, has not taken up legislation to address this issue since that time, shocked until I examined the relationship between the interests opposing that legislation and political campaigns. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in the 1998 election cycle, one of the interests that opposes flow control legislation, Waste Management Inc., contributed $422,275 in soft money to the two major political parties--$85,000 to the Democratic Party and $337,275 to the Republican Party. Mr. President, the issue of interstate waste control effects my home State and 23 other States. For years States have been faced with the challenge of ensuring safe responsible management of out-of-State waste, and the need for State control is even more acute today than in was in 1995. Congress is the only body that can give the States the relief they need from being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of trash. We have not acted on a problem that effects nearly half of our States, and citizens are left to try to understand our inaction by following the money trail behind the trash truck. 
   We need to take prompt action on this matter, and I think this legislation is a good first step. I urge my other colleagues to consider lending this bill their support.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, I want to express my support for the resolution, which was adopted by the Senate yesterday, to begin a new tradition in this distinguished body: to begin our days by saying the Pledge of Allegiance each morning in this Chamber. There were about ten of my colleagues on the floor this morning to inaugurate this new tradition, and I only wish there could have been more to join us. 
   We will pay tribute to our flag, the greatest symbol of our freedom, in the Chamber where we are sworn to uphold the very freedoms the flag symbolizes. There can be no more fitting tribute to our Constitution than the free and unfettered expression of patriotism that the Pledge of Allegiance represents. 
   Today in the Senate, we honor the flag. In contrast to this voluntary celebration of our flag, the other chamber today may vote on an amendment to our Constitution that asks us to turn away from the freedoms we cherish in order to protect our flag, in effect to compel reverence for the flag. This amendment, in a misdirected attempt to protect a cherished symbol, instead tears at the very fabric of our freedom. 
   In the past, I have walked in the Appleton, WI, parade on Flag Day. I am told that it is the largest Flag Day parade in our country--it is certainly one of the best. As I saw the faces of those people, those Americans, as they waved the flag, filled with pride in our great nation, I knew then not only that patriotism shouldn't be legislated, but that it doesn't need to be. It is in this Chamber and in the hearts and minds of millions of Americans across this country. Again, I celebrate the effort to pay tribute to the flag, and the freedom it represents, in this Chamber each day. I only hope when and if the amendment that threatens that freedom is considered on this floor, we will remember the Pledge of Allegiance, and remain true to the liberty it speaks of, and that all of us hold so dear.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, to introduce a bill that will assist our local law enforcement agencies to respond in a timely fashion to life or death situations. 
   Sheriffs in my state and around this country have found that their hands are tied when it comes to sharing helicopters or other public aircraft with neighboring jurisdictions. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department recently became the first sheriff's department in Wisconsin to acquire a helicopter. Neighboring counties would like to borrow that helicopter and reimburse the Milwaukee County Sheriff for the cost of their use of that helicopter. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Department is perfectly willing to share its helicopter but it can't easily do so. Under current law, in order for the assisting agency to receive a cost reimbursement from the neighboring jurisdiction for use of a helicopter, the neighboring sheriff must first exhaust the possibility that a private commercial helicopter is available. Even when the neighboring sheriff is faced with a serious imminent threat to life or property, the law requires the neighboring sheriff to first determine whether a privately operated helicopter is available. This law is absurd and puts everyone's safety at risk. 
   Law enforcement agencies use helicopters for a variety of reasons--to chase a suspect fleeing the scene of a crime, in search and rescue missions, to control crowds in public gatherings, to transport prisoners and to detect and eradicate marijuana. Saving lives and maintaining law and order is delayed if we require sheriffs to determine first whether they can find a private helicopter. Public safety is also jeopardized because private commercial pilots are likely not trained law enforcement personnel with experience in sensitive and sometimes dangerous situations. But if we allow sheriffs to share their aircraft with neighboring jurisdictions without first exhausting private avenues, law enforcement response is far more likely to be swift and sure. 
   This bill modifies the definition of ``public aircraft'' so that law enforcement agencies no longer need to make an attempt to find a private helicopter operator before using a neighboring jurisdiction's helicopter. 
   Mr. President, we demand that law enforcement act quickly and professionally to life or death situations. But we're not giving them the tools they need to do their job. We must do our part. I urge my colleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to change the law and give the sheriffs in Wisconsin and across this country the tools they need to keep our communities safe and secure.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my colleagues for their efforts on the floor to highlight the Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill to empower people around the country who rely on HMOs and other managed care programs for their health care needs. I join them today in enthusiastic support for badly needed legislation that will expand protections for patients who are at the mercy of managed care practices. 
   I strongly support the principles of improving access, quality, and accountability in the delivery of managed care. I believe we can achieve valuable patient protections by passing a bill that ensures some commonsense protections, access to emergency care, access to specialists, and a strong internal as well as external appeals process. 
   We need to keep medical decisions in the hands of doctors. We have to ensure that managed care entities are held legally accountable for administrative decisions that affect patient care and well-being. Protections are extremely important to restoring a sense of security and control to managed care enrollees and their doctors. 
   The protections in this bill are being debated on the Senate floor, but they are also being lobbied furiously in the halls of Congress. Some of the most powerful and influential interest groups in this country have a huge stake in seeing this bill fail, while others want it to succeed. 
   Last week, I announced on the floor that from time to time I will point out the role of special interest money in our legislative process. I call it the 800-pound gorilla sitting in this Chamber every day that nobody talks about, but that cannot be ignored. I said I will start calling attention to this gorilla more often through an effort that I have dubbed, ``The Calling of the Bankroll,'' where I discuss how much money different interests lobbying a particular bill have made in campaign contributions in order to influence our work in this Chamber. 
   I can't think of a better issue than managed care and the future of managed care to once again call the bankroll. 
   Let me give four quick examples. One, the managed care industry: What does it want? The managed care industry wants to prevent any further regulation of the industry, and it doesn't want to be held liable when administrative decisions and policies affect the health, or even the very lives, of patients. 
   What did managed care give? During the last election cycle, managed care companies and their groups made more than $3.4 million in soft money, PAC and individual contributions. This is roughly double what they spent during the last mid-term election cycle of 1993-1994. Their contributions keep increasing. 
   A second example is the pharmaceutical industry. What do they want? They have a big interest in the kind of drugs managed care patients have access to. 
   What did they give? Behind their point of view is the weight of at least $10.6 million in PAC and soft money contributions. That is how much the pharmaceutical and medical supplies industries gave during 1997 and 1998. 
   A third example: The doctors, the AMA, what do they want? Of course,  doctors have an interest in seeing managed care reform. They want to eliminate restrictions on doctor-patient communication. More broadly, they want to prevent managed care companies from exerting further control over the way they practice medicine. 
   What did they give? The AMA made significant PAC and soft money donations during the last election cycle, more than $2.4 million worth. 
   A fourth example: Organized labor, what does it want? It is a strong supporter of the Patients' Bill of Rights. Unions are also major campaign contributors. 
   What did they give? The AFL-CIO alone gave parties and 
   candidates close to $2 million in 1997 and 1998. 
   I am sure there are other interests that should be included on this list. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and add to this list so there will be as full a picture as possible of the money behind and against this piece of legislation. I think it is relevant to what is happening on the Senate floor. 
   Why should Americans care? While many Americans rightly worry about the quality of their health care, I believe the quantity of campaign contributions that may affect that care should also be of serious concern. The huge quantity of campaign contributions influences the very terms of the health care debate itself, how health care is discussed, and whether some health care issues are even discussed at all. 
   Wouldn't it be better if the public could have confidence that we are deciding crucial issues such as the rights of Americans covered by managed care, without the shadow cast by campaign contributions, without the 800-pound gorilla sitting here on the floor? 
   I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to call the bankroll on this issue. Information about campaign contributions should be easily available to my colleagues and to the public to clearly demonstrate the connection between what the wealthy interests want in Washington and what the average American gets on Main Street. 
   It is time to debate, amend, and come to conclusion on a Patients' Bill of Rights. These are health care issues with real consequences for ordinary Americans at the doctor's office, the pharmacy, the emergency room, and the admitting desk. 
   We have to ask: When your critically ill child needs to see a specialist, do you want to think that laws affecting decisions on care are influenced by campaign contributions or have been made based on a thoughtful, reasoned debate. 
   I think the American people deserve better than this. Until we have campaign finance reform, our debate on crucial issues such as health care is going to be carried out under the shadow of these huge amounts of money and the influence that so many Americans are convinced they wield. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment does not kill the National Endowment for Democracy, nor does it cut off one penny from its budget. Rather, this amendment reforms the grant-making process of the NED. 
   The NED seeks to promote democracy around the world. I believe it is only just and fair that its grant-making process be open and competitive on a level playing field for all applicants. Mr. President, 65 percent of NED's grant money is automatically allocated to four so-called ``core grantees,'' while everyone else has to compete for the remaining 35 percent of the budget. I really do not think this is fair. 
   The core grantees have done good work in promoting democracy abroad, but are the programs sponsored by the core grantees so superior to all the other programs we have that we must assume they should automatically get the full 65 percent while everyone else has to compete for a much smaller piece of the pie? 
   My amendment does not cut funding for the NED or even necessarily for these four grantee groups. It just phases out, over a 5-year period, the automatic bonanza these groups get every year. This amendment will simply level the playing field so these groups have to compete for funding like everybody else. 
   So I urge my colleagues to understand this does not cut a penny. It does not change the basic mission. It just says we have reached the point, with these taxpayers' dollars, where it really should be phased down to the point where everything is done on a competitive basis. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, in offering an amendment to encourage a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. This amendment closely mirrors what he and I and several other Senators express in S. Res. 96, introduced last month. We are offering this as an amendment to highlight the significance of the process underway in East Timor that will once and for all determine its political status. 
   As we all know, Indonesian President Habibie announced on January 27 that the government of Indonesia was finally willing to seek to learn and respect the wishes of the people in that territory. On May 5, the Governments of Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement to hold a United Nations-supervised ``consultation'' on August 8 to determine East Timor's future political status. 
   Despite this positive development, excitement and tension over the possibility of gaining independence have in recent months led to a gross deterioration of the security situation. Militias, comprised of individuals determined to intimidate the East Timorese people into support for continued integration with Indonesia and widely believed to be supported by the Indonesian military, are responsible for a sharp increase in violence. 
   Let me recount some of the horror stories I have heard coming out of East Timor recently. To cite just a few examples, pro-government militias, backed by Indonesian troops, reportedly shot and killed 17 supporters of independence on April 5. Shortly thereafter, pro-independence groups reported clashes, arrests and deaths, as well as civilians fleeing violence in six cities. One of those cities was Liquica where at least 25 people were brutally murdered by pro-government militias when up to 2000 civilians sought shelter in the local Catholic church. Later, on April 17, hundreds of East Timorese fled the capital of Dili as knife-wielding militias attacked anyone suspected of supporting independence. At least 30 were killed in this incident as Indonesian troops made little effort to stop the violence. The perpetrators have not all been on the government side. Over the years there have been atrocities on the pro-independence side as well. In recent months, however, the overwhelming majority of the violence has come from army elements and militias under their effective control. Overall, hundreds of civilians have been killed, wounded or ``disappeared'' in separate militia attacks. 
   Unfortunately, the possibility exists that tension and violence could still terrorize the island between now and the ballot, although I hope that is not the case. Pro-integration militia leaders announced on April 29 that they reject the concept of the upcoming ballot, or anything that could be considered a referendum. They have further stated that if a ballot leads to independence, they are prepared to fight a guerrilla war for decades if necessary to defend Indonesian rule of the territory. Independent observers fear that neither side will accept a loss in the ballot, thus setting the stage for a prolonged conflict in East Timor. This type of rhetoric does not reassure us about the prospects for a successful transition for the people of East Timor, regardless of which form of government they choose. The climate in East Timor today, sadly, may have become too violent for a legitimate poll to take place. Worse yet, the agreement on the ballot process will be rendered meaningless if people must fear for their lives when they dare to participate in the process. 
   In the May 5 agreement, the Government of Indonesia agreed to take responsibility for ensuring that the ballot is carried out in a fair and peaceful way. Unfortunately, it is unclear that they are implementing this aspect of the agreement. Quite the opposite. Whether Indonesian troops have actually participated in some of these incidents or not, the authorities certainly must accept the blame for allowing, and in some cases encouraging, the bloody tactics of the pro-integration militias. The continuation of this violence is a threat to the very sanctity and legitimacy of the process that is underway. Thus, the Leahy-Feingold amendment specifically calls on Jakarta to do all it can to seek a peaceful process and a fair resolution to the situation in East Timor. 
   I am encouraged by the calm manner in which the people of Indonesia went to the polls earlier this month to elect a new government. While the election was not perfect, it is a step in the right direction for the people of that nation, and demonstrates an openness not seen in decades there. 
   I believe the United States has a responsibility--an obligation--to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian government to help encourage an environment conducive to a free, fair, peaceful ballot process for the people of East Timor. I am pleased that we have taken a leadership role in offering technical, financial, and diplomatic support to the recently authorized U.N. Assistance Mission in East Timor, known as UNAMET. 
   Our amendment recognizes the very significant progress that has been made so far, in particular the calming impact the very presence of U.N. officials has appeared to have on the security situation in the capital, Dili. Nevertheless, problems still remain, so the amendment also highlights the increase in violence and human rights abuses by anti-independence militias and urges the Habibie government to curtail Indonesian military support to the militias. The amendment also encourages the Government of Indonesia to grant full access to all areas of East Timor by international human rights monitors, humanitarian organizations and the press, and to allow all Timorese who now live in exile the ability to return to East Timor to participate in this important ballot. 
   It is not in our power to guarantee the free, fair exercise of the rights of the people of East Timor to determine their future. It is, however, in our interest to do all that we can to work with the United Nations, other concerned countries, the government of Indonesia and the people of East Timor to create an opportunity for a successful ballot process. We cannot forget that the Timorese have been living with violence and oppression for more than 23 years. These many years have not dulled the desire of the East Timorese for freedom, or quieted their demands to have a role in the determination of East Timor's status. 
   We have to do all we can to support an environment that can produce a fair ballot in East Timor now and throughout the rest of this process.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will offer today an amendment to make a simple reform to the grants process for the National Endowment for Democracy, the funding of which is authorized in the State Department authorization bill which we are debating. 
   I want to make this very clear. I am not here to cut or eliminate NED funding by even one penny. This doesn't cut the program at all. Rather, my amendment simply requires the money given by the American taxpayers to NED each year be distributed fairly and effectively. The amendment, therefore, reforms the NED's grant-making procedures, procedures about which it can fairly be said, as of today, ``The fix is in.'' 
   Here is how the grant process at NED works today. Currently, 65 percent of  NED grant money goes automatically to four so-called core grantees, and these are the Solidarity Center, an arm of the AFL-CIO; the Center for International Private Enterprise or CIPE, an arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and two groups tied to America's major political parties, the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. 
   My amendment simply would require that the grant process of NED become competitive. The amount of grant funds provided automatically to the NED's four core grantees would be reduced incrementally over the next 5 years, so all NED grant funds would be awarded competitively on the merits by the time we get to the end of that 5-year period. 
   I hope we can all agree that more competition among applicants for grant funds is a good thing and that it is the fairest way to apportion the tax dollars NED distributes to help promote democracy. As it stands now, the four grantees are hardly subject to any real scrutiny. That is why I say the fix is in for these very well connected organizations. 
   The NED is a private, nonprofit organization created by the U.S. Government during the cold war in 1983. The idea was a good one. The idea was to strengthen democratic institutions around the world through nongovernmental efforts. The NED is governed by an independent, nonpartisan board of directors and operates with an annual congressional appropriation, so strictly speaking, it is not really an endowment. NED receives 97 percent of its funding from the taxpayers. Until it has significant private sources of funding, it does not make any sense to me to guarantee most of its grants to four private groups. 
   The NED provides some direct grants, conducts analyses of the theory and practice of democratic development worldwide, and serves as a clearinghouse for information on that development. The NED makes hundreds of grants each year to support prodemocracy groups in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. The Endowment supports projects that promote political and economic freedom, a strong civil society, independent media, human rights and the rule of law. 
   There are also programs in the areas of labor, business, and political party development which are funded mostly through the four grantees, although other applicants are prepared to conduct programs in each of these areas. 
   Obviously, I believe in the value of democracy and the imperative of the United States to support democratic development, human rights, and the rule of law abroad. So I do not take lightly at all the admirable aims of the National Endowment for Democracy and do believe these goals are in the national interest of the United States. 
   Nevertheless, I continue to have concerns about this bizarre structure of the endowment ``family.'' As I mentioned, more than 50 percent of the NED's budget, and some 65 percent of the grants it makes, goes to these so-called core grantees--NDI, IRI, CIPE and the Solidarity Center. 
   Why do these core grantees get that funding year after year? Because at NED's inception, they had the political clout to get permanently ``wired in.'' Whatever the goals of the originators of this strange arrangement, it has not been adequately demonstrated that the core groups necessarily offer programs of such superior quality that they should get this annual bonanza while other independent organizations must vie for funding from the NED's small remaining discretionary fund. 
   Sure--I am quick to say this--the core grantees have conducted some excellent programs and many of them certainly serve important U.S. national interests. I am sure they deserve to get some funding. But why is it they are automatically given 65 percent of grant funds? I have to believe there are other organizations out there that can do the job better on some projects, but they are not even allowed to compete for this majority of the money. 
   In fact, I have the list of some 250 organizations that have satisfied those individuals who review the remaining amounts of funds to the point where these organizations have been granted funds. 
   I must say in fairness, considerable progress has been made over the years in addressing many of the most pressing concerns about the selection and monitoring of NED grants. As the result of several studies conducted by the GAO, the Endowment has addressed many issues and has tightened up its project selection and performance monitoring procedures. I certainly recognize that the NED has made a little bit of progress in reducing the percentage of its grants that are slated for these four grantees. It used to be as high as 80 percent of the total NED budget. 
   The NED has seen its funding attacked in this Chamber in recent years, but each time the Senate has made a clear and sometimes overwhelming decision to preserve that funding. I understand that an appropriations bill which was filed last week zeros out funding for the NED, but I am absolutely confident those funds will be restored because there is no other federally funded organization in America that is, frankly, better connected on Capitol Hill than the National Endowment for Democracy. 
   Today, I am certainly being realistic and trying to be positive and helpful and trying to improve the program. I am not attempting to shut down the NED. Let me repeat, my amendment does not seek to kill the National Endowment for Democracy, nor does it cut the program funding even by one dime. Rather, I seek to reform the strange and unique grantmaking structure that has evolved at NED. 
   Let me describe this amendment one more time. This chart shows, again, the situation before our amendment and under current law. The distribution, the very small portion in green is available to everybody else after these four grantees are guaranteed 65 percent of the grant money. My amendment will decrease the amount in blue gradually over 5 years by a small amount each year to 52 percent in fiscal year 2001, 39 percent in fiscal year 2002, so on until 2004 when there would be no noncompetitive funds made available and the funds would go to the applicants who offer the best proposals. A novel idea: All the money goes to the best applicants. That is a pretty good use of taxpayers' dollars, in my 
   view.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the chairman. 
   I will conclude my remarks, and at the conclusion of those remarks, I will, in fact, send the amendment to the desk. This does not necessarily mean any of the four core grantees will have to cut their budgets, but it will mean they will have to actually make their case to NED that their proposals are the best use of taxpayers' dollars. As it now stands, these four grantees know the fix is in, so there is less incentive to make sure every single program is as efficient and well planned as it possibly can be. 
   My amendment will phase out this fix over a 5-year period and compel each of the four grantees to work a little harder to earn their grants, as hard as everybody else, so they can be in this big green pie of the best applicants, not just the guaranteed applicants. 
   Again, this is not an amendment to kill or even cut funding for the NED. It is an amendment to use old-fashioned American competition to ensure that the best use of taxpayers' dollars in the funding of democracy programs happens abroad. My colleagues who believe in fairness and competition and the efficient use of the taxpayers' money should vote aye.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require at this point. 
   Let me first say how much regard I have for the Senator from Indiana and enormous respect for his role on the Committee on Foreign Relations, his demeanor, and his knowledge. It is a pleasure to work with him. We disagree on this one. 
   The Senator from Indiana suggests that this point about the National Endowment for Democracy comes from out of the blue. I have been here long enough to know that year after year the former Senator from Arkansas, Mr. BUMPERS, made several attempts to eliminate the program or change the program. It has been a regular subject of scrutiny in this body, as it should be. I think to suggest that it is a surprise that there would be some oversight of NED is not quite accurate. 
   What the Senator from Indiana is indicating, of course, is the political parties and business and labor are at the heart of a pluralistic democratic society, that they are the fundamental concepts of American political life. I agree with him. I think it is important that as we endeavor to encourage democratization around the world that we try to include all of these elements of our democracy. But I do not think it should be primarily limited or dominantly limited to these four core grantees. 
   The Senator from Indiana knows far better than I do the origins of the program. I appreciate his comments about what the thinking was in the beginning, how these groups got together, and how the structure was crucial for the program to begin. I do not dispute that. I am sure there is some validity. 
   But I think after some 15 years, these groups and these organizations have had time enough to develop their programs so they are ready to fly on their own, that they are ready to compete against other applicants for the funding in a free and fair manner. 
   The fact that the NED's four core grantees are guaranteed to receive a set amount of funds every year seems to me fundamentally unfair and is a contradiction of our democratic principles, especially when you are talking about guaranteeing private groups taxpayer dollars, which is exactly what this does. Every group that conducts democracy programs should have an equal opportunity to pursue Federal funding for its programs, not just the ones that are so powerfully and politically connected. These four well-connected groups are not the only people in America that know something about political parties or business or labor, but it is only these groups that are guaranteed 65 percent of the grant money from this program. That is almost entirely taxpayers' dollars. To me, a much more appropriate system would be a competitive one. 
   As I understand it, since the Senator fairly raises the concern about whether the original understanding between these groups would be preserved, I am told that the board itself has representatives of both of the major political parties, as well as of business and labor, and that they are the ones that would be making these decisions. 
   The Senator from Indiana indicates that this is a situation where something isn't broke so do not fix it. The fact is, in recent years a number of suggestions have been made about ways to help fix the program. There have been some problems. Some of these problems have been fixed. What I am trying to do here is continue the process of fixing it, of improving it. 
   As I indicated earlier, some 80 percent of this money was once tied up only for these four groups. Now it is lower, but it still represents 65 percent of available grant money. What I am saying is, let us fix it, improve it, over the next 5 years, phasing this down so each year this gets a little smaller. By the time we get to the end of that 5-year period, we have all the money based on a fair competition and still have a board that has representatives of both political parties and of business and labor so there is no real possibility of unfairness or partisanship in this regard. 
   All of this is offered in the spirit of trying to further improve the program, acknowledging its great worth, acknowledging the many good things that are done. Let's just do a little better job of making sure our taxpayers' dollars are spent in a manner that involves the best interests and the best applicants getting the money. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in 1906, Wisconsin sent a new Senator to Washington, and this body and this Government have never been the same since. 
   From the moment he arrived, delivering powerful orations on the floor of this Chamber and taking on the most powerful interests in this country and all around the world, he became the stuff of legend. Of course, I am talking here about Robert M. La Follette, Sr., who was destined to become one of the greatest Senators in the history of this distinguished body. It is fitting that his portrait now hangs in the Senate reception room outside of this Chamber, along with just four other legendary Senators: Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Robert Taft. 
   When he came to this body, La Follette was already known as an insurgent, and his arrival made more than a few of his colleagues nervous, including, of course, the Senate's leadership. At the time, because this was prior to the ratification of the 17th amendment in 1913, Senators were still appointed by State legislatures, and La Follette himself had been appointed to fill the office after he served as Governor of Wisconsin for 5 years. 
   By and large, however, the Senate of the early 1900s was dominated by the powerful economic interests of the day: the railroads, the steel companies, and the oil companies, and others. 
   Senator La Follette did not disappoint those in his State and across the country who looked to him to champion the interests of consumers, taxpayers, and citizens against those entrenched economic forces. The Senate in those days, if you can imagine this, had an unwritten rule that freshman Senators were not supposed to make floor speeches. 
   La Follette broke that rule in April of 1906. He gave a speech that lasted several days and covered 148 pages of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. Speaking on the most important legislation of the year, the Hepburn Act regulating railroads, La Follette discussed the power of the railroad monopolies and declared:  
   At no time in the history of any nation has it been so difficult to withstand those forces as it is right here in America today. Their power is acknowledged in every community and manifest in every lawmaking body.  
   So La Follette offered amendments to try to make railroad regulation more responsive to consumer interests. His amendments lost, of course, but that was part of the plan. That summer he went on a speaking tour across the country. He described his efforts to change the Hepburn Act. And then he did something extraordinary and unprecedented: He read the rollcall on his amendments name by name. This ``calling of the roll'' became a trademark of La Follette's speeches. Its effect on audiences was powerful. You see, at the time Senators' actual votes on legislation were not as well known publicly as they are today. And then when Americans found out that their Senators were voting against their interests, they were shocked and they were angry. 
   The New York Times reported the following:  
   The devastation created by La Follette last summer and in the early fall was much greater than had been supposed. He carried senatorial discourtesy so far that he has actually imperiled the reelection of some of the gentlemen who hazed him last winter.  
   La Follette's calling of the roll was part of an effort to expose corporate and political corruption. His view was that powerful economic interests controlled the Senate, preventing it from acting in the public interest. Then, in 1907, just a year after La Follette had come to the Senate, the Congress finally acted on legislation that had been under consideration since an investigation a few years earlier of insurance industry contributions to the political parties. That legislation, the Tillman Act, banned corporations from making political contributions in connection with Federal elections. 
   Today, over 90 years later, obviously much has changed in the Senate and in the country. For one thing, the votes of Senators are available almost instantly on the Internet and published  regularly in the newspapers. Come election time, political ads remind voters regularly about our voting records. La Follette's idea that the public should know how its representatives have voted and it should hold those representatives accountable for their votes is well accepted in our modern political life. 
   The power of corporate and other interests in the Senate is still too strong. The nearly century-old prohibition on corporate political contributions is now a mere fig leaf made meaningless by the growth of soft money. Today, corporations, unions and wealthy individuals give unlimited--I repeat, unlimited--contributions of soft money to the political parties. While, technically, corporations still do not contribute directly to individual campaigns, they might as well be. Individual Members of Congress get on the phone and raise soft money for their parties, and that money is in turn targeted at congressional races. Some Members have set up so-called leadership PACs to accept soft money for use in their own political endeavors. Soft money has, once again, given corporations the kind of influence over this Congress that La Follette railed against on this very floor. 
   Since I have come to the Senate, I have noticed that we talk about the money that funds our campaigns and the influence on policy only a few times a year. That is when we are debating actual campaign finance legislation. It is almost as if the influence of campaign money on our business here is an abstract proposition, relevant only when we debate changing the way campaigns are financed. But we all know that the power of money in this body is much more pervasive and, I would say, insidious than that. 
   We know, if we are honest with ourselves, that campaign contributions are involved in virtually everything that this body does. Campaign money is the 800-pound gorilla in this Chamber every day that nobody talks about but that cannot be ignored. All around us and all across the country, people notice the gorilla. Studies come out on a weekly basis from a variety of research organizations and groups that lobby for campaign finance reform that show what we all know: The agenda of the Congress seems to be influenced by campaign money. 
   But in our debates here, we are silent about that influence, and how it corrodes our system of government. 
   Mr. President, we can allow that silence no longer. In the tradition of my illustrious predecessor Senator La Follette, I am inaugurating a modern version of the Calling of the Roll. I will call it the ``Calling of the Bankroll.'' 
   I don't expect to be listing votes or specific contributions to specific Senators, but I will be providing vital information, both to my colleagues and the public, as to how much money special interests are donating overall to candidates and political parties. I'll be providing a context for evaluating our debates on legislation, and I'll be doing it right here on this floor, and in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, for the convenience of the public and my colleagues. 
   I plan to Call the Bankroll from time to time here on the floor of this Senate as we debate significant legislation and at least until this body passes a campaign finance reform bill. This body can no longer ignore the 800 pound gorilla. I'm going to point him out sometimes when I speak on a bill, because I think we in the Senate need to face this issue head on. We cannot just pull our head out of the sand to discuss the influence of money on the legislative process once a year when we take up a campaign finance bill. 
   I am sure my colleagues are familiar with the old adage that is attributed to Otto von Bismark: ``If you like laws and sausages, you should never watch either one being made.'' Well, we might not like to admit that campaign contributions are an ingredient of our legislation, but we know that they are. And the public knows too, although they might not know the details. 
   But it's those details which help the public see the big--and disturbing--picture of the influence of wealthy interests on our legislation. 
   It's time to illustrate clearly how our flawed campaign finance system, which corrupts our democracy, also affects our daily lives. The public has a right to this information--it has a right to know how the special interests have worked to influence legislation, and how that influence has had an impact on everything from defense spending to the Y2K problem, and just about everything in between. 
   I think this information should be part of our public debate on important legislation, and that's why I will Call the Bankroll from this floor. In fact I've already started to do this over the past few weeks on several occasions. For example, when we considered the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill, which included a rider to delay the implementation of new mining regulations, I called attention to the more than $29 million the mining 
   industry contributed to congressional campaigns during the last three election cycles, and the $10.6 million the industry made in soft money contributions during the same period. During our debate over the Juvenile Justice bill, I noted the $1.6 million the NRA gave in PAC money in the last election cycle, and the $146,000 in PAC money Handgun Control gave during the same period. Just last month, when I argued for my amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill concerning the Super Hornet, I included information about the more than $10 million in PAC and soft money contributions the defense industry made in the last cycle. I also pointed out during the debate on Y2K legislation that the computer and electronics industry gave close to $6 million in PAC and soft money in 1997 and 1998, while the Association of Trial Lawyers of America gave $2.8 million. 
   We have many difficult and important bills to work on this year, Mr. President: bankruptcy reform, financial modernization when it comes back from conference, a patients' bill of rights, and all of our spending bills. It won't be difficult, indeed it will be easy, to find examples in each of those areas of huge campaign contributions coming from industries and groups that are affected by our work. The bankruptcy reform bill itself is a prime example: The members of the National Consumer Bankruptcy Coalition--an industry lobbying group made up of the major credit card companies, and associations representing the nation's big banks and retailers--gave nearly $4.5 million in contributions to parties and candidates in the last election cycle. 
   The public deserves to know about this, Mr. President. It deserves to know about the campaign contributions these interests are giving us and our political parties at fundraisers--fundraisers that sometimes take place the night before or the night after we vote on bills that affect them. 
   Now Mr. President, I do not have any pride of authorship here, nor do I plan to lay out the whole picture of campaign contributions that might be relevant to our discussion of a bill. To the contrary, I encourage my colleagues to join this debate. And in particular I want to recognize the effort of my friend the Senator from South Carolina, who on Tuesday came to this floor during the closing debate on the Y2K bill, calling his own roll of the high tech companies that have made campaign contributions to this Congress. 
   If any of my colleagues feel that the contributions of a different industry or interest group should be highlighted, I encourage them to add that information to their remarks in this chamber. I will also welcome any corrections or additions that my colleagues might wish to provide. Nor do I believe that organizations that may have supported me should be exempt from the Calling of the Bankroll. Providing information about the contributions of any group or interest is welcome, and, more than that, it is critical to the purpose of this effort. 
   This information should be in the RECORD, and all Senators should be aware that these facts are 
   in the RECORD as they decide how to cast their votes. It is time that the 800-pound gorilla of campaign money be made a part of our debate on legislation. 
   I look forward to the day when the Calling of the Bankroll will no longer be necessary; when this body has adopted bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation to ban soft money and to restore the vitality of the law banning corporate contributions to federal elections that was enacted in 1907, the year after Robert La Follette of Wisconsin came to the Senate.  
   Let me close with another quote from Senator La Follette's inaugural speech on the floor of the Senate. He was responding to the argument that public sentiment had been whipped into an unreasonable hysteria over the question of whether the railroads controlled the Congress. His words seem quite apt to me as a response to those who argue on this floor that we really have no campaign finance problem in this country--and that the media and the groups that support reform exaggerate the impact of money on the legislative process. He said:  
   [I]t does not lie in the power of any or all of the magazines of the country or of the press, great as it is, to destroy, without justification, the confidence of the people in the American Congress....... It rests solely with the United States Senate to fix and maintain its own reputation for fidelity to public trust. It will be judged by the record. It can not repose in security upon its exalted position and the glorious heritage of its traditions. It is worse than folly to feel, or to profess to feel, indifferent with respect to public judgment. If public confidence is wanting in Congress, it is not of hasty growth, it is not the product of `jaundiced journalism.' It is the result of years of disappointment and defeat.  
   Mr. President, the Senate must respect the public judgment and fix its reputation for fidelity to the public trust. It must let the solid bipartisan majority of this body that supports reform, work its will and pass a campaign finance reform bill this year. Until it does, Mr. President, I plan to Call the Bankroll. I'm going to acknowledge the 800 pound gorilla in this chamber, and I'm going to ask my colleagues to do the same. And then I'm going to see if we can't agree that it's time to show him the door. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few remarks with regard to the FY 2000 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation. First, let me state that I am pleased that this bill takes strides to significantly reduce, in the name of fiscal soundness, appropriations for two programs about which I have been concerned for quite some time--the non-power programs of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Animas La-Plata project by the Bureau of Reclamation. I intend to support this appropriations bill this year. 
   For the past few Congresses, I have argued that the non-power programs of the TVA should be seriously scrutinized and reduced appropriately. I have introduced legislation which would put TVA on a glidepath toward eliminating federal funding for the non-power programs. The former Senator from Alabama (Mr. HEFLIN) and I personally met with TVA to discuss this legislation and the appropriate length of time for a federal fund phase-out. In the last two appropriations cycles, I have written to the appropriations committee  asking them to reduce TVA non-power appropriations, and in the FY99 appropriations bill the funds for TVA were reduced significantly to a third of the more than $150 million that TVA received when I began raising this issue in the 104th Congress. My voice in the Senate on this issue is echoed by a number of members of the House Appropriations Committee who zeroed out funds for TVA non-power programs in the House-version of the FY99 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation. 
   I am pleased that this resounding call for scrutiny of these programs is leading to real results. In FY99 the TVA received $50 million dollars, with $7 million of that total specifically for the Land Between the Lakes (LBL) Recreation Area. This appropriations legislation virtually eliminates appropriations for TVA non-power programs, retaining only $7 million in flat funding for LBL. The TVA non-power activities for which we have previously provided funds include providing recreational programs, making economic development grants to communities, and promoting public use of TVA land and water resources. I understand the Committee's concerns that the management of the LBL is a federal responsibility. I believe that the Committee has acted appropriately in this matter. In fulfilling this function, which is federal, the Committee has provided resources specifically for LBL but not for the other non-power programs. In the future, Congress needs to evaluate whether other federal land management agencies, such as the Interior Department, might be able to manage this area, but this is the right step at this time. 
   I believe it is appropriate for the Senate to significantly reduce funds for TVA's appropriated programs because there are lingering concerns, brought to light in a 1993 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, that non-power program funds subsidize activities that should be paid for by non-federal interests. In its 1993 report, CBO focused on two programs: the TVA Stewardship Program and the Environmental Research Center, which no longer receives federal funds. Stewardship activities historically received the largest share of TVA's appropriated funds. The funds are used for dam repair and maintenance activities. According to 1995 testimony provided by TVA before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Water Appropriations, when TVA repairs a dam it pays 70%, on average, of repair costs with appropriated dollars and covers the remaining 30% with funds collected from electricity ratepayers. This practice of charging a portion of dam repair costs to the taxpayer, CBO highlighted, amounts to a significant subsidy. If TVA were a private utility, and it made modifications to a dam or performed routine dredging, the ratepayers would pay for all of the costs associated with that activity. I think that removing appropriations for this program largely ends concerns about taxpayer subsidization of the dam repair and maintenance program. 
   I am also pleased that this legislation contains a $1 million reduction from the Budget Request for the Animas La-Plata project. In this bill, the project receives a total of $2 million for FY 2000. As my colleagues know, I have long been active in raising Senate awareness about the financial costs of moving forward with development and construction of the full-scale version of the Animas-La Plata project. I do not want the federal government to proceed with construction of the full-scale project while the Department of the Interior continues its discussion about alternatives to that project. 
   As my colleagues will recall from the debate on an amendment I offered to the FY 98 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation on this matter, the currently authorized Animas-La Plata project is a $754 million dollar water development project planned for southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico, with federal taxpayers slated to pay more than 65% of the costs. I am glad that we are not proceeding on this project full steam ahead, and I am pleased to see that the Appropriators recognize that on-going alternatives discussions can proceed without a large infusion of new resources. 
   Despite these gains in reducing funds for some questionable programs, the bill contains some shifts in program funding about which I am concerned. Particularly troubling is the reduction in the President's proposed increase in the renewable energy budget. The bill provides $261 million more for the DOE defense activities than requested by the Administration, but reduces the request for solar and renewable energy programs by $92.1 million. I believe that it is important for the federal government to make appropriate investment in solar and renewable technology, particularly in light of our efforts to restructure the electricity system and meet our overall energy efficiency goals. I would hope that we could find a way to shift resources within this legislation to make it possible to fulfill the Administration's request. 
   Overall, Mr. President, I am pleased that this bill can meet our requirements under the budget caps by reducing unnecessary spending. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, ever since I arrived here in 1993, I have supported initiatives to help restore the public's confidence in government by limiting the influence of special interests over the legislative process. It's a big task, Mr. President and along the way I have offended and even angered some people around here. 
   I have worked to require greater disclosure of the expenses and activities of lobbyists. I pushed to put in place new gift restrictions that stopped Senators and staff from accepting free vacations and fancy dinners from lobbyists as used to be the norm around here. And finally, I have argued that we need to reform the woefully loophole-ridden campaign finance system that we currently live under. Reforming Congress is a crucial issue for me because the electorate has grown to view this institution with cynicism and disdain, and even to fundamentally distrust their own elected representatives. 
   Now Mr. President, a crucial part of the culture of special interest influence that pervades Washington is the revolving door between public service and private employment. But by putting a lock on this revolving door for some period of time, we can send a message that those entering government employment should view public service as an honor and a privilege--not as another wrung on the ladder to personal gain and profit. 
   There are countless instances of former members of Congress who once chaired or served on committees with jurisdiction over particular industries or special interests now lobbying their former colleagues on behalf of those very industries or special interests. Former committee staff directors are using their contacts and knowledge of their former committees to secure lucrative positions in lobbying firms and associations with interests related to those committees. 
   There have been some very interesting studies showing just how regularly the revolving door swings. Of the 91 lawmakers who left Congress at the end of 1994, at least 25 later registered to lobby. A 1995 study of 353 former lawmakers showed that one in four had lobbied for private interests after leaving office. In fact, there were more than 100 former Members of Congress who appear on the lobbying reports filed in August 1997, and that doesn't count Members who left office in 1996, since they could not yet register without violating the current revolving door law. I could go on, Mr. President, and on and on and on. The problem of revolving door lobbying is quite clear. 
   The amendment I am offering today is designed to strengthen the post-employment restrictions on Members of Congress and senior congressional staff that are currently in place. Keep in mind, post-employment restrictions are nothing new. There is currently a one year ban on former members of Congress lobbying the entire Congress as well as a one-year ban on senior congressional staff lobbying the committee or the Member for whom they worked. And by Senate rule, we prohibit all departing Senate staff from lobbying their former employing entity for one year. Members and senior staff are also prohibited from lobbying the executive branch on behalf of a foreign entity for one year. 
   The amendment would double the current restriction and prohibit members of Congress from lobbying the entire Congress for two years. Thus, in most cases, an entire two year Congress will intervene before a former Member can be back lobbying his or her former colleagues. Perhaps the longer period will encourage those who leave the Congress to seek opportunities for future employment outside of the lobbying world. Perhaps it will discourage big business from putting former Members on their payroll right after they leave office. But in any event, this longer ``cooling off period'' will give the public more confidence in the integrity of this body. 
   With respect to staff, the amendment makes some changes as well. Here we are talking only about those staff who make three quarters or more of the salary of a member of Congress. In other words, this amendment would change the post-employment restrictions only on staff making over $102,000 per year. These senior staff work closely with us, at the committee level, or with the leadership, or in our personal offices. This amendment would prohibit these very senior staffers from lobbying the House of Congress in which they work during the same 2-year period as we are prohibited from lobbying the entire Congress. So senior Senate staffers couldn't lobby the Senate and senior House staffers couldn't lobby the House. 
   Now here we have struck a balance, Mr. President. It seems clear to me  that the current restrictions which prohibit lobbying contacts only with the former employer, whether Member or committee, are inadequate. High level staffers have contacts and work closely with people throughout the body, not just with the other staff or Members on their committees or in their Member's office. These are people making $102,000 or more. They are highly in demand in the lobbying world, not just for their expertise but for their contacts. If the cooling off period is to mean anything with respect to these 
   senior staff, it must cover more than the individual committee or member of Congress for whom they worked. 
   Some senior staff undoubtedly have contacts with their counterparts in the other body. But their day to day work, and therefore their closest contacts will be in the house of Congress in which they work. So this amendment leaves an outlet for the use of a former staffer's expertise in lobbying the other body. To me, that is a reasonable balance, and not an unreasonable restriction on a staffer's future employment. 
   Now some might argue that we are inhibiting talented individuals from pursuing careers in policy matters on which they have developed substantial expertise. It may be asked why a former high-level staffer on the Senate Subcommittee on Communications of the Senate Commerce Committee cannot accept employment with a telecommunications company? After all, this person has accumulated years of knowledge of our communication laws and technology. Why should this individual be prevented from accepting private sector employment in the communications field ? 
   But my amendment does not bar anyone from seeking private-sector employment. Staffers can take those jobs with the telecommunications company, but what they cannot do is lobby their former colleagues in the house of Congress for which they worked for two years. They can consult, they can advise, they can recommend, but they cannot lobby their former colleagues. 
   I considered an even longer cooling off period for staffers to be barred from lobbying their former employer, be it a member or a committee, but decided that the two year, house of Congress limitation strikes the best balance. Two years is the length of an entire Congress. That period of time should be enough to mitigate to a great extent the special access that the staffer is likely to have because of his or her former position. At the same time, it allows the staffer who is intent on pursuing a lobbying career to concentrate on the other body for two years, and then return to the side of the Capitol in which he or she worked after that period. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is not an attack on the profession of lobbying. The right to petition the government is a fundamental constitutional right. Simply attacking lobbyists does not address the true flaws of our political system. Lobbying is merely an attempt to present the views and concerns of a particular group and there is nothing inherently wrong with that. In fact, lobbyists, whether they are representing public interest groups or Wall Street, can present important information to Members of Congress that may not otherwise be available. 
   I strongly believe that there is no more noble endeavor than to serve in government. But we need to take immediate action to restore the public's confidence in their government, and to rebuild the lost trust between members of Congress and the electorate. This amendment is a strong step in that direction because it addresses a perception that too often rises to the level of reality--that the interests that hire former Members or staffers from the Congress have special access when they lobby the Congress. We need to slow the revolving door to address that perception, and this amendment will do just that. 
   I am pleased that the managers have agreed to accept my amendment and that it has become part of the bill that will go to the President for signature. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate all the hard work that has been done on this legislation by my colleagues. I know they are sincere in their concern about the effect of Y2K computer failures and in their desire to do something to encourage solutions to those problems in advance of the end of the year. But this bill is ill-considered  and ill-advised. As the Justice Department has noted with respect to original version of this bill, and I think the judgment remains accurate: this bill would be ``by far the most sweeping litigation reform measure ever enacted if it were approved in its current form. The bill makes extraordinarily dramatic changes in both federal procedural and substantive law and in state procedural and substantive law.'' 
   For all the heated rhetoric we have heard on this floor over the past few days, I have not seen evidence that legislation is needed to create incentives for businesses to correct Y2K problems. More importantly, I do not agree that this bill actually creates those incentives. Indeed, I think that in many ways it does just the opposite. It rewards the worst actors with its damages caps and its prohibition of recovery for economic loss, and it may even give incentives to delay corrective action with the cooling off period and the changes in class action rules. 
   A major concern that I have about this bill is the breathtakingly broad and unprecedented preemption of state law that it contains. I simply do not agree that we should overrule the judgment of state legislatures and judges who have defined the law in their states for traditional contract and tort cases. This bill benefits one class of businesses, those who sell products that may cause Y2K problems, over another class of business, those who buy such products, and individual consumers. It completely disregards whether state lawmakers and judges would reach the same conclusions. I see no reason why Congress should dictate tort and contract law to the states. Protections for injured parties that have been developed through decades of experience are being summarily wiped out by the Congress, on the basis of a very thin record. Mr. President, that is not right. 
   Another serious problem with this bill has to do with the elimination of joint and several liability in the vast majority of Y2K cases. Mr. Chairman, we all have heard many times the horror story of a poor deep pocket defendant found to be only 1% liable who ends up on the hook for the entire judgment in a tort case. Frankly, I am aware of few actual examples of this phenomenon, but I know it is theoretically possible. A far more frequent occurrence, however, is a case where two or three defendants are found equally liable, but one or more of them is financially insolvent. The real question raised by joint and several versus proportionate liability is who should bear the risk that the full share of damages cannot be collected from one defendant. Who should have the responsibility to identify all potentially liable parties and bring them into the suit? Who should bear the risk that one of the defendants has gone bankrupt? Should it be the innocent plaintiff who the law is supposed to make whole, or a culpable defendant? Mr. President, to me that question is easy to answer. Someone who has done wrong should bear that risk. But states have reached different balances on this question, based on their own experience of decades and decades of tort cases. How is it that we in the Congress all of the sudden became experts on this issue? Where do we get off overriding the judgment of state legislatures on this crucial question of public policy? 
   Now I recognize that changes to the bill obtained by Senator DODD would limit the effect of the abrogation of joint and several liability in a narrow set of cases involving egregious conduct by defendants or particularly poor plaintiffs. But I don't think this change goes far enough in protecting innocent victims from the harsh reality that sometimes the worst offenders have the least money. Section 6 of this bill eliminates joint and several liability in virtually every Y2K case, and that is wrong. 
   Let me quote one of the bill's stated purposes from Section 2(b) of the bill--``to establish uniform legal standards that give all businesses and users of technology reasonable incentives to solve Y2K computer date-change problems before they develop.'' But Mr. President, this bill doesn't establish uniform standards. It preempts 
   state law only in one direction--always in favor of defendants and against the interests of the injured party. 
   As I stated before, I don't agree that uniform standards are needed. I think our state legislatures and judges are due more respect than this bill gives them. But if there is truly a compelling interest in uniformity, then I do not understand why this bill preempts state laws that offer more protection to injured plaintiffs but not those state laws that are less generous to the injured party. Yesterday, we even adopted, without debate, an amendment offered by Senator ALLARD that says specifically that any state law that provides more protection for defendants in Y2K cases than this bill does is not preempted. So preemption is a one-way street here. If you're in a state where the law is moving in the same direction as this bill and cutting back on the damages that can be recovered in a Y2K suit, you're fine, but if your state is going in the wrong direction, you get run over. 
   Mr. President, that is not fair. And it certainly is not consistent with the bill's stated purpose of providing uniform national standards. 
   Let me give you one example. About 30 states have no caps on punitive damages. Three other states have caps that are more generous than the caps in this bill. In Y2K cases involving defendants who are small businesses as defined in this bill, those state laws would be preempted. About a dozen states have higher caps on some kind of cases and lower caps on others. This bill would partially preempt those state laws, overriding the balance that the duly elected state legislatures in question decided was fair and just. 
   Six states do not allow punitive damages in tort cases, and one has caps that are lower than those permitted under this bill. Those states would be allowed to continue to apply the judgments of their legislatures and courts in Y2K cases. 
   My state of Wisconsin has generally rejected imposing arbitrary caps on punitive damages, instead trusting judges and juries to determine an appropriate punishment for defendants who act in a particularly harmful and intentional or malicious way. The state of Washington, to take an example, has eliminated punitive damages. Why should the policy decisions of the state of Washington be respected by this Congress more than the policy decisions of Wisconsin--or Pennsylvania, or Arizona, or New York, or the majority of states. 
   The one-sided tilt of this bill is very troubling. Punitive damages caps of any kind are bad ideas I believe. Remember that in every state punitive damages can be awarded only in cases of intentional or outrageous misconduct. So the protection offered by these caps goes to the very worst Y2K offenders--those who have acted intentionally or maliciously to avoid fixing their Y2K problems. Where is the justice and balance in that? 
   Mr. President, because I think it's important for the Senate to take every aspect of legislation into account in our debate here on the floor, I have a few more facts I'd like to add--facts about how much money has been donated to the political parties and to candidates by a couple of powerful groups that have a huge stake in this bill. 
   Now the dollar figures I'm about to cite, keep in mind, are only for the last election cycle, 1997 to 1998. First there's the computer and electronics industry, which gave close to $6 million in PAC and soft money during the last election cycle--$5,772,146 to be exact. And there's also the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which gave $2,836,350 in PAC and soft money contributions to parties and candidates in 1997 and 1998. 
   As I said, I cite these figures so that as my colleagues weigh the pros and cons of this bill, they, and the public, are aware of the financial interests that have been brought to bear on the legislation. The lobbying efforts, as we know, have been significant, and so have the campaign contributions. And the public can be excused if it wonders if those contributions have distorted the process by which this bill was crafted. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased that the Administration has indicated it will veto this bill in its current form. I will support that veto as well as voting against the bill. We need to encourage problem solving and remediation to avoid a disaster on January 1 in the Year 2000. But we don't need to enact this bill. Indeed, while trying to address a supposed litigation explosion,  we may well have created an explosion of unfairness to people and businesses who are injured by the negligent or reckless behavior of those who sell non-Y2K compliant products.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support a joint resolution disapproving the extension of normal-trade-relations status to China. 
   This is the fourth time that I have joined with other Senators to support such a resolution because I believe that trade policy is an effective tool that the United States can and should use  with respect to the policies of the Chinese Government. I am pleased to join Senator SMITH in supporting his resolution. 
   On June 3, President Clinton announced his intention to extend the normal-trade-relations trading status to China. As I understand it, without actually affecting the practical application of tariff treatment, legislation last year replaced the term ``most-favored-nation'' in seven specific statutes with the new phrase ``normal trade relations.'' Regardless of which phrase you use, I find this policy unacceptable. Although we have expected the President to make such a decision, I can only say that under the current circumstances I am once again disappointed in the President's decision. In fact, I have objected to the President's policy since 1994, when he first de-linked the issue of human rights from our trading policy. The argument made then was that trade privileges and human rights are not interrelated. At the same time, it was said, through ``constructive engagement'' on economic matters, and dialogue on other issues, including human rights, the United States could better influence the behavior of the Chinese Government. 
   Clearly events of the last few months have shown the fallacy of that assumption. 
   I have yet to see persuasive evidence that closer economic ties alone are going to transform China's authoritarian system into a democracy. Unless we continue to press the case for improvement in China's human rights record, using the leverage of the Chinese Government's desires to expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see how U.S. policy can help conditions in China get much better. De-linking trade and human rights has resulted only in the continued despair of millions of Chinese people, and there is no evidence that NTR or MFN or whatever you want to call it, has significantly influenced Beijing to improve its human rights policies. Basic freedoms--of expression, of religion, of association--are routinely denied. The rule of law, at least as we understand it, does not exist for dissenters in China. 
   Virtually every review of the behavior of China's Government demonstrates that not only has there been little improvement in the human rights situation in China, but in many cases, it has worsened--particularly in the weeks preceding the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In fact, China has resumed its crackdown on dissidents who might have attempted to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Human rights groups have documented the detention of more than 50 dissidents since May 13, with a number still in custody. These have included two detained for helping to organize a petition calling on the government to overturn its verdict on Tianamen. The detainees include former student leaders at Tiananmen, a member of the fledgling Democracy Party, intellectuals, and journalists. Those not detained have reportedly been under constant surveillance amid calls by China's top prosecutor for a clampdown on ``all criminal activities that endanger state security,'' including 
   such activities as signature gathering and peaceful protest. 
   More generally, five years after the President's decision to de-link MFN from human rights, the State Department's most recent Human Rights Report on China still describes an abysmal situation. According to the report. ``The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses. *.*.* Abuses included instances of extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy incommunicado detention, and denial of due process.'' This list does not even touch on restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and religion or the continuing abusive family planning practices. 
   In my view, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion except that ``constructive engagement'' has failed to make any change in Beijing's human rights behavior. I would say that the evidence justifies the exact opposite conclusion: human rights have deteriorated and the regime continues to act recklessly in other areas vital to U.S. national interest. We have so few levers that we can use against China. And if China is accepted by the international community as a superpower without regard to the current conditions there, it will believe it can continue to abuse human rights with impunity. The more we ignore the signals and allow trade to dictate our policy, the worse we can expect the human rights situation to become. 
   This year--1999--is likely to be the most important year since 1989 with respect to our relations with China. We face many thorny issues with China, including the accidental embassy bombing, faltering negotiations regarding accession to the World Trade Organizations and the recent release of the Cox report on Chinese espionage. 
   But even with all that is going on, the United States and others in the international community yet again failed to pass a resolution regarding China at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva earlier this spring, largely because China lobbied hard to prevent it. Despite China's efforts to avert a resolution, the United States must also shoulder some of the blame for the failure to achieve passage--our early equivocation on whether we would sponsor a resolution and our late start in garnering support for it no doubt also contributed to the lack of accomplishment in Geneva. While we would certainly prefer multilateral condemnation of China's human rights practices, the failure to achieve that at the UN Commission on Human Rights proves that it is even more important for the United States to use the levers that we do have to pressure China's leaders. We can not betray the sacrifices made by those who lost their lives in Tiananmen Square by tacitly condoning through our silence the continuing abuses. 
   We know that putting pressure on the Chinese Government can have some impact. China released dissident Harry Wu from prison when his case threatened to disrupt the First Lady's trip to Beijing for the U.N. Conference on Women, and its similarly released both Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan around the same time that China was pushing to have the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing. After losing that bid, and once the spotlight was off, the Chinese government rearrested both Wei and Wang. These examples only affirm my belief that the United States should make it clear that human rights are of real--as opposed to rhetorical--concern to this country. 
   If moral outrage at blatant abuse of human rights is not reason enough for a tough stance with China--and I believe it is and that the American people do as well--then let us do so on grounds of real political and economic self-interest. We must not forget that we currently have a substantial trade deficit with China. Over the past few years, the U.S. trade deficit with China has surged. It has risen from $6.2 billion in 1989 to nearly $57 billion in 1998. Political considerations aside, a deficit of that size represents a formidable obstacle to ``normal'' trading relations with China at any point in the near future. Other strictly commercial U.S. concerns have included China's failure to provide adequate protection of U.S. intellectual property rights, the broad and pervasive use of trade and investment barriers to restrict imports, illegal textile transshipments to the United States, the use of prison labor for the manufacture of products exported to the United States, as well as questionable economic and political policies toward Hong Kong. 
   This does not present a picture of a nation with whom we should have normal trade relations. Or, if the Administration accepts these practices as ``normal'', perhaps we need to redefine what normal trade relations are. These are certainly not practices that I wish to accept as normal. 
   My main objective today is to push for the United States to once again make the link between human rights and trading relations with respect to our policy in China. As I have said before, I believe that trade--embodied by the peculiar exercise of NTR renewal--is one of the most powerful levers we have, and that it was a mistake for the President to de-link this exercise from human rights considerations. 
   So, for those who care about human rights, about freedom of religion, and about America's moral leadership in the world, I urge support for S.J. Res 27  disapproving the President's decision to renew normal-trade-relations status for China.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, June is a very special month for this nation's dairy industry. It is the month farmers and consumers join together to commemorate the contributions and history of our great dairy industry by celebrating National Dairy Month. 
   Even before the 1937 inception of National Dairy Month, Wisconsin led the nation in milk and cheese production. Even today, Wisconsin leads the nation in cheese volume, processing nearly 90 percent of the more than 22 billion pounds of milk produced into cheese. More than 350 varieties of cheese are produced in the state, including, Cheddar, American, Muenster, Brick, Blue and Italian, not to mention the famous Limburger cheese variety, which is only produced in Wisconsin. Also, Wisconsin buttermakers produce nearly 25 percent of the America's butter supply. 
   National Dairy Month is the American consumer's oldest and largest celebration of dairy products and the people who have made the industry the success it is today. During June, Wisconsinities will hold nearly 100 dairy celebrations across our state, including dairy breakfasts, ice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, festivals and other events. These events all highlight the quality, variety and great taste of Wisconsin dairy products and honor the producers who make it all possible. 
   June Dairy Month is a time to celebrate America's dairy industry and Wisconsin dairy's proud tradition and heritage of quality. It provides Wisconsin's dairy farmers a special time to reflect on their accomplishments and those of their ancestors, and to look forward to continued success in the future. 
   Wisconsin was nicknamed America's Dairyland in the 1930s, but it became a leader in the industry soon after the first dairy cow came to Wisconsin in the 1800's. Dairy history and the state's history have been intertwined from the beginning. Why, before Wisconsin was even declared a state, Wisconsin's first cheese ``factory'' established when one clever Wisconsinite combined milk from her cows with milk from her neighbor's cows and made it into cheese. 
   Other Wisconsin dairy firsts include: the development of Colby cheese in 1874, the creation of brick cheese in 1875, the first dairy school in America--established in 1891 at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the first statewide dairy show in the U.S. in 1928, and the creation of the world-record holding 40,060 pound, Grade-A Cheddar cheese in 1988. And Wisconsin also can claim one of the best-tasting inventions in the history of dairy industry: the creation of the first ice cream sundae in 1881. 
   Also unique to Wisconsin's dairy industry is the crowing of ``Alice in Dairyland.'' This lucky young woman serves as the state's dairy ambassador all over the country, and often in other parts of the world. Last year's Alice, Jennifer Hasler of Monroe, represented  Wisconsin well as she promoted Wisconsin's agriculture in California, Arizona, Minnesota and even Japan. She generated millions of dollars in unpaid advertising for hard working Wisconsin farmers. I congratulate her on her achievements and her hard work and wish the new Alice good luck in her year serving Wisconsin agriculture. 
   I am proud to honor this great American tradition--proud to honor the dairy producers not only in Wisconsin, but also those across this great nation.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to stand in strong support for this amendment. This straightforward amendment to strike tens of million of dollars for luxury aircraft for military commanders, brought to the floor by Senators BOXER and HARKIN is about our men and women in uniform. 
   It is about the men and women that we have heard so much about over the past years, the central players in the services' readiness crisis. It is about the men and women whose lives are on the line in operations around the world. There is no question, Mr. President, that we must provide them with the necessary resources to defend themselves and the United States. 
   Just last year, there was a virtual consensus that the armed services were facing a readiness crisis. Last September, the Joint Chiefs testified that there was a dangerous readiness shortfall. General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, claimed that ``without relief, we will see a continuation of the downward trends in readiness . . . and shortfalls in critical skills.'' Army Chief of Staff General Dennis Reimer stated that the military faces a ``hollow force'' without increased readiness spending. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson asserted that the Navy has a $6 billion readiness deficit. So it went for all the services. 
   To address the readiness shortfall, the Congress passed on emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The bill was well-intentioned in its support for the efforts of our men and women in uniform. Unfortunately, something happened on the way to the front lines. The bill spent close to $9 billion, but just $1 billion of it went to address the readiness shortfall. 
   We added $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization still has not spent all that money, yet we have added another $3.5 billion for the BMDO in this bill. Last year's supplemental also added billions to what has become an expected emergency, that being our operations in Bosnia. That other unexpected emergency, the year 2000, received a billion dollars. And so it went. What happened to readiness? 
   It is with wonderment that the appropriations bill before us today would spend upwards of $40 million in the next fiscal year, and perhaps as much as half a billion dollars over the next ten years on luxury jets for four-star generals. Am I missing something or is this absurd? We actually have troops that qualify for food 
   stamps and DOD can justify spending tens of millions of dollars next year for luxury jets. 
   This bill will allow the Air Force to lease executive business Gulfstream V jets for the military's unified and regional commanders in chief. This bill also spends $27 million for five UC-35 corporate aircraft that the Pentagon did not even ask for this year. How can this be? 
   According to John Hamre, the assistant secretary of defense, DOD has an inventory of almost 500 operational support airlift, or OSA, aircraft, including 70 Learjets. The Army owns 160 OSA aircraft, the Air Force 111 OSA aircraft, the Navy 89 OSA aircraft; and the Marines 24. The General Accounting Office found that DOD's operational support fleet ``far exceeded any possible wartime requirement.'' Yet, the Air Force and certain members of  Congress believe this to be a high military priority. 
   Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to close their eyes for a few minutes while I describe the jet that has become such a military priority. I take this directly from Gulfstream's website:  
   From the 100 percent fresh air control system, to the comfortably maintained 6,000 foot cabin altitude at 51,000 feet, to cabin size--a generous 1,669-cubic-feet and the longest in the industry--the Gulfstream V provides an interior environment unmatched in transoceanic business travel. The jet also offers a substantial outfitting allowance of 6,700 pounds--more than 12 percent greater than any other business aircraft current or planned--which affords owners and operators the freedom to select furnishings and equipment with minimum tradeoffs. Space-age titanium mufflers and vibration isolators eliminate hydraulic system noise. Plentiful insulation in the side panels reduces sound further, and we've even reengineered Gulfstream's trademark expansive, oval windows to lessen noise levels. The total effect is library-like science conducive to a productive trip.  
   Now I ask my colleagues to open their eyes and face reality. Supporting the Defense Department's misguided spending priorities is not synonymous with supporting the military. I urge my colleagues to look themselves in the mirror and credibly ask themselves if they can support corporate jets for generals while front-line troops muddle by on food stamps. Which is the higher priority? 
   I cannot vote to increase the defense budget by tens of billions of dollars, including tens of millions for corporate jets, which the budgets for veterans' health care, education, agriculture and other programs are facing deep cuts. 
   Throwing good money after bad is not tolerated at other Departments and agencies. Why is it tolerated with DOD? Defense Week reported just yesterday that the Navy has lost track of almost 1 billion dollars' worth of ammunition, arms and explosives. Additionally, DOD has yet to pass an audit. A 1998 GAO audit couldn't match more than $22 billion in DOD expenditures with obligations; it could not find over $9 billion in inventory; and it documented millions in overpayments to contractors. GAO concluded that ``no major part of DOD has been able to pass the test of an independent audit.'' 
   Mr. President, we need some accountability in the Defense Department. Voting for the Boxer-Harkin amendment shows that the Senate supports our men and women in uniform. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. 
   Mr. President, it is almost painful to witness the way in which this Senate is abdicating its responsibility to scrutinize the Department of Defense. During debate on the fiscal year 2000 DoD authorization bill, we had exactly two amendments that called a multi-billion dollars weapons system into question. On this appropriations bill, we had exactly two amendments worthy of extensive debate. Two amendments, Mr. President. Here we have a defense policy that perpetuates a Cold War mentality into the 21st century, and the Senate has no questions. 
   Mr. President, on the heels of an authorization bill that exemplifies the Pentagon's utter failure to adapt its priorities to the post-Cold War era, the American taxpayer is left holding the bag paying for the mess. There are a number of theories that attempt to explain the difficulties faced by the armed services. There is a dearth of thoughtful solutions. The general consensus is that if we pour enough money into the Defense Department, the problems will go away. Unfortunately, effective problem-solving doesn't work that way. 
   The DoD has a weapons modernization strategy that makes it impossible to buy enough new weapons to replace all the old weapons on a timely basis, even though forces are much smaller than they were during the Cold War and modernization budgets are projected to return to Cold War levels. Consequently, the ratio of old weapons to new weapons in our active inventories will grow to unprecedented levels over the next decade. 
   Subsequently, that modernization strategy is driving up the operating budgets needed to maintain adequate readiness, even though the size of our forces is now smaller than it was during the Cold War. Each new generation of high complexity weapons costs much more to operate than its predecessor, and the low rate of replacement forces the longer retention and use of older weapons. Thus, as weapons get older, they become more expensive to operate, maintain, and supply. 
   Couple this with an accounting system that has failed each and every GAO audit since enactment of the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, and you have a poorly managed, misguided strategy inviting disaster. 
   Instead of thoughtfully addressing these shortcomings, Mr. President, we proceed to spend the American taxpayers' money as we have in the past. No change. We continue to promote bigger and more expensive weapons systems at the expense of our men and women in uniform. No matter how much money we throw at this problem, we won't find a solution if we stay on this track. 
   For the past year, Mr. President, we've heard the call to address our military's readiness crisis from virtually all quarters. We were told that foremost among the readiness shortfalls were operations and maintenance as well as pay and allowances accounts. 
   Just last year, there was a virtual consensus that the armed services were facing a readiness crisis. Last September, the Joint Chiefs testified that there was a dangerous readiness shortfall. General Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, claimed that ``without relief, we will see a continuation of the downward trends in readiness.......and shortfalls in critical skills.'' Army Chief of Staff General Dennis Reimer stated that the military faces a ``hollow force'' without increased readiness spending. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson asserted that the Navy has a $6 billion readiness deficit. So it went for all the services. 
   To address the readiness shortfall, Mr. President, the Congress passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The bill was well-intentioned in its support for the efforts of our men  and women in uniform. Unfortunately, something happened on the way to the front lines. The bill spent close to $9 billion, but just $1 billion of it went to address the readiness shortfall. 
   We added $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization still hasn't spent all that money, yet we've added another $3.5 billion for the BMDO in this bill. Last year's supplemental also added billions to what has become an expected emergency, that being our operations in Bosnia. That other unexpected emergency, the year 2000, received a billion dollars. And so it went. What happened to readiness? 
   One provision in this bill casts a pall over the readiness needs of our service members and highlights, in microcosm, the Defense Department's misguided priorities. This appropriations bill will spend upwards of $40 million in the next fiscal year, and perhaps as much as half a billion dollars over the next ten years on luxury jets for four-star generals. Am I missing something or is this absurd? We actually have more than 11,000 troops that qualify for food stamps and DoD can justify spending tens of millions of dollars next year for luxury jets. How can this be? 
   Mr. President, one concern goes to the heart of the entire debate on our national defense. The underlying question is this: Why should the Pentagon receive billions dollars more in funding when it has failed utterly to manage its budget? Throwing good money after bad isn't tolerated at other departments and agencies. Why is it tolerated with DoD? 
   Defense Week reported just yesterday that the Navy has lost track of almost $1 billion worth of ammunition, arms and explosives. Additionally, DoD has yet to pass an audit. A 1998 GAO audit couldn't match more than $22 billion in DoD expenditures with obligations; it could not find over $9 billion in inventory; and it documented millions in overpayments to contractors. GAO concluded that ``no major part of DoD has been able to pass the test of an independent audit.'' 
   Mr. President, this bill also has some painful implications for other federal programs. Essentially, we are spending tax dollars on a wasteful and misguided defense strategy while domestic programs face steep spending cuts in the upcoming fiscal year. 
   The bill exceeds the Pentagon's request by $1.4 billion. It spends $1.4 billion more than the Joint Chiefs of Staff believe is sufficient to meet our national defense needs. And that additional money is coming out of vital domestic programs that were already facing spending cuts. 
   Mr. President, I cannot vote to increase the defense budget by tens of billions of dollars, including tens of millions for corporate jets, while the budgets for veterans health care, education, agriculture and other programs are facing deep cuts. Supporting the Defense Department's misguided spending priorities is not synonymous with supporting the military. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is a straightforward, common sense measure that establishes greater accountability in the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program. 
   The Navy and Boeing say they need $8.8 billion over the next five years to procure the Super Hornet. Specifically, they say the $8.8 billion would procure the airframe, contractor furnished equipment, and engines. My amendment simply sets a cost cap that holds them to that amount. My amendment doesn't terminate the funding; it doesn't hold that money up; it doesn't even restrict use of the money. My amendment just holds them to the amount that they say they need. 
   I would like to discuss the spectacular medicocrity of the Navy's F/A-18E/F, or Super Hornet, aircraft program, and to raise concerns about the poor decisions that have been made with regard to this breathtakingly expensive program. 
   President Eisenhower warned us four decades ago about the inexorable momentum of the military-industrial complex. Today we face the military-industrial-congressional complex that plods forward with a relentlessness that Ike, for all his foresight, could not have imagined. I have long feared that the Super Hornet is not the future of naval aviation, but rather a step backward. The Super Hornet just isn't worth the cost. It's as simple as that. 
   The Pentagon wants to spend 45 billion of our tax dollars to buy the Super Hornet for the Navy. But the plane isn't as good, in some respects, as the one they currently use, and may have design problems that could cost billions more to fix. ``Super'' is not the way to describe this plane--``superfluous'' really is. 
   For very limited gain, the American taxpayers are getting hit with a 100 percent premium on the sticker price. 
   At this point in the program's development and testing, my colleagues may be asking why I continue to tilt at this windmill. I continue this effort in part because pilots' lives may be placed at risk in the E/F for the next 25 to 30 years. I come to the floor today to point out not just the failings of the Super Hornet but the failed decision-making process that has brought us to this point--a point where both the Pentagon and Congress continue to approach a 21st century reality with a Cold War mentality. 
   Exhibit A for this failed decisionmaking process is the Defense Department's current strategy for its aviation programs. The Super Hornet is just one overpriced piece of this strategy, which carries an almost $350 billion price tag. Here is the real kicker: The strategy will not even adequately replace our existing tactical aviation fleet. 
   This strategy has been roundly criticized. It has been criticized by the Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, members of the congressional Armed Services Committees, the Cato Institute, and defense experts such as President Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Defense, Lawrence Korb. 
   The Navy's Super Hornet is just the crown jewel in this misguided tactical aviation acquisition strategy. 
   The story of the Super Hornet is one of huge sums of money spent with really very disappointing returns. The plane's failings have been expensive and alarming. These problems do not just empty our pocketbook; they could endanger our pilots. 
   I want to discuss what the Navy has described as the ``pillars'' of the Super Hornet program. These are the performance parameters that the Navy touts as justifications for this expensive program. But these pillars have become problems. 
   First and foremost is the plane's range. The Navy argues that the Super Hornet will fly significantly farther than the Hornet. But these improvements have yet to be proven in reality. What is worse, initial Super Hornet range predictions have actually declined as flight data has been gathered. By continuing to base range predictions on actual flight test data, the Super Hornet range in the interdiction role amounts to an 8-percent improvement over the Hornet, and this is not particularly impressive. 
   Adding to the range shortcoming is the wing-drop problem. When the Super Hornet is in air-to-air combat, when it most needs to maintain its precise ability to position itself, the plane can lose wing lift, a problem beyond the pilot's control that essentially causes the plane to roll out of position. 
   We have been wrestling with the wing problem for a couple of years now, and it still is not resolved. Potential fixes for the wing-drop problem will decrease range, but since we do not know which solution the Navy will employ, the actual decrease is not yet known. 
   Also affecting the range, believe it or not, is the potential of bombs colliding with each other or with the aircraft. The Navy's solution increases drag, thus resulting in a deficiency that would preclude the aircraft from carrying external fuel tanks. If the aircraft does not carry the two 480-gallon tanks, it will not be able to meet its required range specification. The Navy and its contractor now have little choice but to redesign the wing pylons. 
   A second pillar of the program is survivability. Since the inception of the Super Hornet program, the Navy has asserted that the aircraft will be more survivable than the current Hornet. Based on operational tests, however, survivability issues now comprise the majority of the program's deficiencies, as identified by the Procurement Executive Office for Tactical Aircraft. A chief survivability problem is that the plane's exhaust will actually burn through its decoy tow line. The towed decoy is designed to attract enemy missiles away from the aircraft. Obviously, losing a decoy will not increase survivability. 
   A third pillar put forth is growth space, or space availability to accommodate new systems. When the Navy  was 
   pitching the Super Hornet to Congress, they said the Hornet just did not provide enough space to accommodate additional new systems without removing existing capability. We were told that the Super Hornet would have a 21 cubic feet of growth space versus less than a few feet in the Hornet. But now, GAO actually reports that the Super Hornet has only 5.46 cubic feet of usable growth space. The Navy's F/A-18 upgrade roadmap shows that most of the upgrades planned for the Super Hornet are already planned to be installed on the Hornet as well. 
   The remaining pillars are that of payload and bringback. The Navy claims that the Super Hornet would provide greater payload and bringback than the Hornet. Increased payload should mean the Super Hornet is able to carry more weapons and fuel, and increased bringback should mean that the Super Hornet should return from its mission carrying more of its unused weapons than the Hornet, so pilots do not have to lessen their load for the trip home by dropping missiles unnecessarily. That is what payload and bringback should mean, but with the Super Hornet, the reality falls short of expectation. 
   Flight tests have revealed additional wing stations that allow for increased payload may cause noise and vibration that could damage missiles. In response to this glitch, the Navy is determining whether the missiles need to be redesigned. The Navy also plans to restrict what can be carried on inner wing pylons during Operational Test and Evaluation because of the excessive loads on them. These restrictions would prohibit the Super Hornet from carrying 2,000-pound bombs on these pylons, which reduces the payload capacity for the interdiction mission. GAO also reports that the pylon load problems could negatively affect bringback. 
   What all this technical talk is about, simply stated, is that the pillars supporting the Super Hornet program are crumbling. But don't take my word for it. Just look at the troubling evidence amassed by the GAO which makes the best case yet against the Super Hornet program. 
   According to GAO, the aircraft's performance is less than stellar. In fact, GAO reports that the aircraft offers only marginal improvements over the Hornet, the same finding it made in 1996. Over the last 3 years, GAO has offered evidence of shortcomings in each and every area the Navy declared as justifications for the Super Hornet. In addition, the Super Hornet is actually worse than the Hornet in turning, accelerating, and climbing--actually worse than the plane we are using now that is less expensive. 
   GAO testified recently before Congress that the Super Hornet is not meeting all of its performance requirements. It is behind schedule, and it is above cost, regardless of Navy boasts to the contrary. The Navy's statements on performance actually reflect the single-seat E model of the aircraft, and it does not factor in the performance of the less capable two-seat F model. This is troubling because the F model actually comprises 56 percent of the Pentagon's purchasing plan for the overall Super Hornet program. Not only that, the Navy's assertions about performance are based on projections, not on actual performance. 
   GAO's work has made crystal clear the setbacks the Super Hornet has already faced and the serious problems that lie ahead. There is really a mountain of evidence against the Super Hornet. The Navy's response to that mountain of evidence has been simply to tell you: It's a molehill; don't worry about it. 
   To close the cost gap between the Super Hornet and Hornet aircraft, Boeing is shutting down production lines for the Hornet. Those lines may be prohibitively expensive to reopen if we ever face the facts and decide that the Super Hornet is not worth the cost and risk. 
   The Navy's response to the Super Hornet's troubles has been to play games, to divert attention from the plane's failings, to keep the Navy from relying on the more reliable Hornet, and, most of 
   all, they are playing games with Federal tax dollars. These games have to stop. 
   For the sake of our pilots and American taxpayers, the Navy must be forthright with us. By any reasonable assessment, the Super Hornet program has problems that have to be corrected before we commit our pilots and our taxpayers to a long-term obligation. 
   But that is what is so disturbing here, Mr. President. At the very moment we should be pausing to reassess this program, in our oversight role, the Navy and the Pentagon are pushing for a multiyear procurement contract. 
   This is despite the fact that the Navy has identified 29 major unresolved deficiencies in the aircraft. The Program Risk Advisory Board, which is made up of Navy and contractor personnel, states that there is a medium risk--a medium risk--that the operational test and evaluation might find the Super Hornet is not operationally effective and/or suitable, even if all performance requirements are met. In other words, even if they fix all the problems plaguing the plane, the Super Hornet still might not cut the mustard. How can we sign off on a 5-year $9 billion contract before an aircraft is certified operationally effective? 
   I am very puzzled by that. Instead of signing off on this leap of faith, I suggest the Navy complete OPEVAL and then reassess the prudence of a multiyear procurement contract. The Super Hornet's OPEVAL will allow the Navy and its contractor to stress the aircraft as it would be stressed in the fleet. A multiyear procurement decision prior to OPEVAL defeats the purpose of the test. 
   It is not unreasonable to ask that all deficiency corrections be incorporated into the aircraft design and successfully tested prior to a 5-year, $9 billion procurement commitment. Not only is it not unreasonable, it is consistent with existing Navy criteria. 
   What concerns me most here is the conduct of the Navy and the Pentagon as they have tried to ensure that the Super Hornet has a place in its aviation program. At every turn, they have pushed this plane, despite all logic to the contrary. They have even resisted answering simple, straightforward questions about the plane's performance. 
   My own experiences trying to extract information from the Pentagon about the Super Hornet's performance have been fraught with difficulties. Last November, I sent a straightforward letter to the Secretary of Defense that asked some simple questions about the status of the E/F. At the time, Congress had just appropriated more than $2 billion for the third lot of production. After that letter, I wrote four additional times urging DOD to answer very specific, clear questions regarding the performance of the aircraft in its latest flight test. 
   Three months later, I received a memorandum stating that it ``addresses some'' of my ``concerns.'' This was unfortunate because I was assured by Pentagon officials familiar with the report that my questions could be easily answered in full. I can assure everyone who is listening that I will not stop asking until I get answers. 
   I would like to conclude my initial remarks by telling my favorite story about this profoundly flawed program. 
   This past January, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition commissioned an independent study to address my questions. I had been asking for a study for some time, so I was heartened and relieved and looking forward to the results. 
   Unfortunately, the person chosen to lead the inquiry is a well known Washington defense lobbyist who had a longstanding business relationship with Boeing, the Super Hornet's primary contractor. During the meeting with my staff, the lobbyist did not disclose his firm's association with Boeing. Later my staff telephoned him, and he described his firm's association with Boeing in response to direct questions from my staff. Then he went on to say that he had terminated his relationship with Boeing ``a few days'' after Mr. Buchanan asked him to perform the independent review--``a few days.'' 
   No one will be shocked to hear that the report was very favorable to the Super Hornet. 
   This latest episode with the Super Hornet highlights a pervasive Pentagon mindset that sometimes sacrifices the interests of our men and women in uniform to the assumption that bigger and more expensive programs are always better. It puts in stark relief the power of the defense industry which gave more than $10 million in PAC money and soft money to  parties and candidates in the last election cycle. 
   In the last 10 years, the defense industry gave almost $40 million to the two national political parties. You know, for that much money, they could buy their own Hornet.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the last 10 years, the defense industry gave almost $40 million to the two national political parties. For that kind of money, these interests could have gotten their own Hornet. Unfortunately, they would have needed another $36 million to get themselves a Super Hornet. 
   Boeing, the Super Hornet's primary contractor, gave more than $3 million in PAC money and more than $1.5 million in soft money during that same period. There were no PACs in Eisenhower's day, but this is what he warned us about, only with higher stakes than he may have imagined. 
   I have stood on the floor of the Senate for 3 years now discussing the inadequacy of the Super Hornet program. And for 3 years, Congress has turned a deaf ear to the facts. I harbor no illusions that the Super Hornet will be terminated. I do hold out hope that this body will use some common sense in procuring the aircraft. 
   My amendment does nothing more than set a cost cap using the exact dollar amount put forward by the Navy--nothing more, nothing less. 
   We owe it to our naval aviators to give them a product worthy of their courage and dedication. And we owe it to the American taxpayers to ensure that we are using their money to modernize our Armed Forces wisely. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is pretty obvious at this point that any effort to question any weapons system is considered an effort to somehow undercut the military strength of our country. The fact is that we have a responsibility to do some oversight on our own. We should not just take the word of Government bureaucrats, whether they are in one Department or the other--the Defense Department or Department of Agriculture. We should not just take their word for it. We have some responsibility to look at the questions that have been raised by independent bodies such as the General Accounting Office that say there are real problems. 
   There has been a great effort here to distort my amendment. It takes the Navy's figure of $8.8 billion and uses that for the cost cap. That is what it does. We have done this before on this particular airplane. My amendment to do this in another phase of the program a couple of years ago was accepted, and it worked just fine. 
   On the engineering and manufacturing development portion of it, it was not a radical attack. This simply takes the Navy's own numbers and holds them to it. We all know what happens with the incredible cost increases that occur with these planes. 
   Where is the role of oversight of the Senate? There is a attitude of ``don't confuse me with the facts'' when it comes to such a complicated, expensive program. It is a $45 billion program, and we are whitewashing the whole thing, even though the General Accounting Office--not me, but the GAO--has identified problems on each of the five pillars of the program. There was essentially no substantive response to any of the points the GAO made that I laid out. They just repeated the facts of the original claims without saying one thing about what has been determined about problems with survivability, and with the additional space. It simply is not as good as originally claimed. 
   So what we are left with is a blank check. This is the only challenge to any weapons system on the floor of the Senate on this entire bill. Where have we come to, that we scrutinize and cut so many other areas of Government? I have worked hard on that and have a good record on it. But why doesn't the Defense Department, and why don't these weapons systems have to share in the scrutiny of everything else? 
   There are problems with this plane. My amendment doesn't terminate the plane; it says we ought to hold them to a dollar amount that the Navy itself has identified. 
   Regarding the Senator's point, that technology improvement language he thinks would help is a giant loophole that will allow anything to get through to add to the cost. In fact, you could fly a Super Hornet through that loophole. 
   How much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Navy would like to rely on flight test data from the single seat E version of the Super Hornet to claim that the aircraft procured under the Navy's F/A-18E/F program will perform up to specifications. Here is the problem. Fifty-six percent of the planes the Navy intends to buy will be the lower performing two-seat F models. My amendment to address this sleight of hand is simple and sensible. It would require that the majority of aircraft ordered under the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program meet the key performance parameters in the Operational Requirements Document before going into full-rate production and before the Navy  enters into a multi-year procurement contract. 
   Mr. President, my colleagues are well aware of my concerns about the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft program. Over the past three years, I've delved into the program's flaws in agonizing detail. Earlier, I was on the floor to offer an amendment that institutes a cost cap on the E/F program. At the time, I took this body through a wide-ranging review of facts and figures from the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation and the General Accounting Office, on the Super Hornet's shortcomings. So I won't subject my colleagues to more of the same facts showing how the Super Hornet program fails to improve on the existing Hornet program more than marginally, or in a cost-effective manner. 
   Mr. President, I'm sure many of my colleagues wonder why I continue on this lonesome crusade. I continue this effort pilots' lives will be placed at risk in the F/A-18E/F for the next 25 to 30 years. On top of that, taxpayers are being asked to pay more than $45 billion for this program. 
   Mr. President, the amendment I offer simply requires the Super Hornet to meet existing performance specifications before going into full-rate production. It is simply a common sense measure. 
   To briefly summarize the contracting process, in 1992, the Secretary of the Navy and the aircraft's primary contractor, Boeing, entered into a contract for the development, testing, and production of the Super Hornet. Within a follow-up Operational Requirements Document, or ORD, which was signed off by the Navy in April, 1997, are a number of key performance parameters. Essentially, Mr. President, the contract states explicitly what the Navy wants the plane to be able to do. 
   Mr. President, the Navy wanted, and I assume still wants, a plane with increased range, increased payload, greater bringback capability, improved survivability, and increased growth space over the existing F/A-18C Hornet aircraft. The Navy calls these improvements the pillars of the Super Hornet program. 
   As I stated earlier, premier among the Navy's justifications for the purchase of the Super Hornet is that it fly significantly farther than the Hornet. As recently as this past January, the Navy claimed the E/F would be able to fly up to 50 percent farther than the Hornet. 
   Mr. President, again, these improvements have yet to be proven in reality. And in the realm of reality, initial Super Hornet range predictions have declined as actual flight data has been gathered and incorporated into further prediction models. If the anticipated, but yet to be demonstrated range improvements are not included in the estimates, the Super Hornet range in the interdiction role amounts to a mere 8 percent improvement over the Hornet. According to GAO, this is not a significant improvement. 
   Mr. President, not only does the Super Hornet fall short in its range, but also in its payload capacity, and growth space improvements. On top of that, the Super Hornet is worse than the Hornet is turning, acceleration, and ability to climb. Again, this plane will cost far more, perhaps twice as much as the current model. 
   As I mentioned earlier, the General Accounting Office testified recently before Congress that the Super Hornet is not meeting all of its performance requirements, is behind schedule, and above cost, regardless of Navy boasts to the contrary. The agency offered evidence of shortcomings in each and every area of the Navy declared as justifications for the aircraft. GAO also states that some of the Navy's assumed improvements to the aircraft have yet to be demonstrated. 
   Mr. President, the Navy's statements on performance reflect the single-seat E model of the aircraft, not the less-capable two-seat F model. This is troubling because the model of the aircraft, not the less-capable two seat F model. This is troubling because the F model comprises 56 percent of the Pentagon's purchasing plan for the Super Hornet. Again, Mr. President, the Navy's statements on performing are based on projections, not actual performance. 
   According to GAO, which has been reviewing the program for more than three years, the aircraft continues to offer only marginal improvements over the Hornet, the same finding GAO made in 1996. After three years of development and testing, Mr. President, we still stand to gain only marginal improvements that don't outweight the cost. 
   Again, Mr. President, I have stood on the floor of the United States for three years now discussing the inadequacies of the Super Hornet program. And for three years, a majority of my colleagues have turned a deaf ear to the facts. I hold out hope that this body will use some measure of common sense in procuring this aircraft. 
   Mr. President, this amendment merely enforces what should be blatantly obvious. Before moving to full-rate production, or entering into a multi-year procurement contract, of the Super Hornet, the contract between the Navy and its contractor should be enforced. The Navy signed a contract to receive a plane that can do certain things. I agree with the Navy. 
   The plane ought to do certain things. We shouldn't go forward until we know that it really does those things. 
   This amendment simply requires that the Navy receive the plane it expects. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield myself the time required at this point. 
   Let me say exactly what this amendment does rather than rely on the characterization that was given. This appears to be something of a sleight-of-hand with regard to proving that this plane actually meets the performance parameters it is supposed to meet. 
   There are two versions of the Super Hornet aircraft, a one-seat E model and another that has been proven to be less capable, a two-seat F model. The Navy now states that 56 percent of the Super Hornet will be F models, but they are trying to rely on the performance of the E model to determine compliance with performance parameters. 
   The amendment simply requires that the version of the Super Hornet aircraft that represents the majority--the majority--of the Navy's purchasing plan has to satisfy all the key performance parameters in the program Operational Requirements Documents. That is what this amendment does. 
   For this to be characterized as an additional hurdle, as has been done by the Senator from Pennsylvania, is simply not accurate. It simply says that the flight test data used by the Navy, represent the version of the plane they intend to purchase. All we are trying to do is to be sure that the information we are getting and that the assumptions are based on the planes that are actually being purchased and that they actually do what they said they would do. 
   That is not an additional step. That is just somebody buying something, making sure they are actually getting what they contracted for. Shouldn't we, as the guardians of the taxpayers' dollars, be sure we are getting what we contracted for? How can that be an additional hurdle, unless we want to allow the contractor to give us something we didn't want and, in fact, paid a fortune for? 
   The Senator from Pennsylvania reasonably asked whether or not there is a problem with the GAO having a limited time to make their certification. I am happy to enter into an agreement for a time limit for the GAO, with the Senator's indication that he would regard that as a reasonable change. That is not a problem that was intended, and we can solve that quite simply. 
   This is an incredibly expensive program. Hopefully, this plane, if it goes through, will work as well as has been advertised. Hopefully, it will not cause problems for our pilots, although there are those who are concerned about that. 
   All this amendment does is say that when we make the decision to move to the next phase, it is actually based on the plane we are buying. Any household in America would use that much caution when buying something. We talked a lot as we brought down the deficit, on a bipartisan basis, about doing things like American families have to do. Don't we have a responsibility to make sure we are getting the plane we are paying for? We are not paying for it, the taxpayers are paying for it, and they will pay $45 billion for it. It ought to be the plane that we are supposed to get. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

The only real objection to this is primarily to the role of the GAO in this process. The only other objection was raised by the Senator from Missouri who made much of the fact that of course there is a difference between the E and F plane. 
   The problem is that originally the Navy and the contractor sold this plane on the assumption that only 18 percent of the planes would be the ``F'' version. The reality now is that 56 percent of the planes are going to be the lower-performing ``F'' version. That is why it is essential that we have this certification, at least by the Navy, that in fact a majority of the planes will meet the performance parameters. 
   So I am very interested to see if the Senators here who have raised this concern will allow me to meet their concerns so we can pass this commonsense amendment which, as the Senator from Michigan indicated, without that flaw would be a worthwhile amendment. 
   With regard to the other amendment, the cost containment amendment, let me just make a couple of points in response to the Senator from Michigan. I do want to say he has been a tremendous advocate for appropriate cost containment and careful evaluation of military programs throughout his career. 
   First of all, regarding our cap that we propose, which of course is a figure the Navy proposed in the first place, that $8.8 billion is only for over a 4-year period. It is not a permanent cap. Second, if there is a need for new technologies, as has been posited by the Senator from Michigan, if something comes up that absolutely has to be done--we are here. We are not going anywhere. If something dramatic happens that requires additional technology, we are in a position to respond to that. In fact, the amendment I have proposed allows a number of flexibilities. It is not an absolute $8.8 billion cap. 
   It allows cost increases and decreases for inflation. It allows changes for compliance in Federal, State, and local law, and it also contemplates the possibility of quantity changes in the number of planes within the scope of the multiyear contract, which we all know can dramatically affect the cost of a plane. 
   There is substantial flexibility built into this amendment, and if there is a need for the new technology, we are here and able to respond to that. Otherwise, all we are doing, as I indicated earlier, by including this language for new technology, we are essentially gutting our own amendment. We are removing the cost cap provision in our amendment. 
   How many people would do that? If you are buying a car, if a car manufacturer says: Well, we reserve the right, if we come up with a new thing to put on this car, to charge you a couple more thousand bucks after we cut the contract, after we cut the deal. I do not think we should be doing business that way. We have built flexibility into this amendment. 
   Again, I indicate that all this is is the Navy's own figure of $8.8 billion. We did a similar cost cap on the same plane previously. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is a straightforward, commonsense measure that establishes accountability in the Super Hornet program. It holds the Navy to the $8.8 billion over the next 5 years to procure the Super Hornet. My amendment simply sets a cost cap at that level and holds them to that amount. 
   Again, this amendment holds the Navy to the $8.8 billion, its own figure. It doesn't terminate the funding, it doesn't hold the money up, it doesn't even restrict the use of the money, it just holds them to the amount they say they need. I hope the body will use common sense in procuring this aircraft. 
   The amendment does nothing more than set a cost cap using the exact dollar amount put forward by the Navy; nothing more, nothing less. We owe it to our naval aviators and to the taxpayers to make sure we provide a modernized plane that does what it is supposed to do within the parameters the Navy has set forth itself.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voice my strong opposition to the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense Authorization Act. 
   It is with disgust and sorrow that we are forced to bear witness to a defense bill that fails, once again, to understand the 21st century reality of national defense. So we set the foundation for our national defense in the new millennium to serve the needs of the Cold War era. 
   Mr. President, this bill exemplifies the Pentagon's utter failure to adapt its priorities to the post-Cold War era. It promotes a pervasive Pentagon mind set that sacrifices the interests of our men and women in uniform to the assumption that bigger and more expensive weapons systems are always better. And even then, the prohibitive cost of the new weapons systems necessary means that we can't replace, on a one-to-one basis, old weapons for newer replacements. No matter how much money we throw at this problem, we won't find a solution. Short of a true shift in the paradigm at the heart of our national defense strategy, this problem will continue unabated. 
   Mr. President, I start with a perennial culprit of misguided defense strategy; that is the continued spending of billions of dollars on wasteful and unnecessary programs. But this year, it's been taken a step further. 
   For the past year, Mr. President, we've heard the call to address our military's readiness crisis from virtually all quarters. We were told that foremost among the readiness shortfalls were operations and maintenance as well as pay and allowances accounts. This 288.8 billion dollar bill would have us increase O&M by all of $1.1 billion, with $1.8 billion for a pay raise and a retirement benefit change. That works out to about 1 percent. I'm sure that our men and women in uniform are not impressed. 
   Mr. President, even the pay raise and retirement change is fraught with uncertainty and was addressed in a less than proper manner. In February, this body passed the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights. We did so without benefit of hearings, prior to the budget resolution, and prior to the issuance of three reports on whether such changes would improve recruitment and retention in our armed forces. 
   Then, this month, we paid for the entire $1.8 billion price tag for the pay raise and benefit reform in the emergency supplemental bill. Yet we still await reports from the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Department of Defense on the efficacy of that action. Earlier this year, GAO offered preliminary data on a study showing that money has been overstated as a factor affecting decisions to stay in or leave the military. 
   Instead, GAO found that issues like a lack of spare parts; concerns with the health care system; increased deployments; and dissatisfaction with military leaders have at least as much effect on retention, if not more, then pay issues. These are the same concerns that I have heard from the men and women out on the front lines. 
   Mr. President, there's no question that certain services have a recruiting and retention problem. For a variety of reasons, officers and enlisted members are leaving the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and these services are having problems bringing enough new people on board. Serious questions remain unresolved about the cause of this problem, or its best solution, yet we will authorize and appropriate the entire $1.8 billion in an extraordinary and inappropriate manner. This is a quick fix that fails to address the recruitment and retention problem in a comprehensive and thoughtful manner. 
   I agree that many service members need a raise. These men and women have chosen to represent our country. They deserve to be paid adequately. 
   Meanwhile, in this bill, Mr. President, programs that didn't even warrant DoD's request will receive $3.3 billion. Additionally, weapons procurement is up $2.9 billion beyond DoD's request. Missile defense programs, that paragon of efficiency and effectiveness, is up $509 million. These and other provisions raise the question, just how important does the Pentagon think our men and women in uniform are? 
   Mr. President, the bill authorizes 2.9 billion dollars for the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program. It also authorizes the Navy to enter into a five-year $9 billion multi-year procurement contract for the Super Hornet. It's no secret that I have numerous concerns about the program, but I am also troubled by the manner in which the Pentagon and the Navy have moved the Super Hornet forward. And my concerns are not addressed in the least by this bill. In fact, this bill makes them worse. 
   The Super Hornet program hasn't even begun its Operational Test and Evaluation, yet we're ready to authorize a five-year, $9 billion procurement contract. The program has 29 unresolved, major deficiencies, yet we're ready to authorize a five-year, $9 billion procurement contract. The program still fails significantly to improve on the existing 
   F/A-18C aircraft, yet we're poised to blindly authorize a five-year, $9 billion procurement contract. Mr. President, the logic is baffling. 
   The current Hornet program has been proven reliable and cost-effective. Why do we want to replace the Hornet with a bloated, cost-prohibitive aircraft that offers marginal benefits over a reliable fighter?  
   Mr. President, this bill has some remarkable budgetary issues. Essentially, we can't pay for what this bill authorizes, and remain under the budget caps. The bill meets the fiscal year 2000 Budget Resolution target for budget authority, but current estimates state that the bill exceeds the outlay target in the Budget Resolution by $2 to $3 billion. Even by Washington standards, that is real money. 
   Mr. President, one concern goes to the heart of the entire debate on our national defense. The underlying question is this: Why should the Pentagon receive billions dollars more in funding when it has failed utterly to manage its budget? 
   In a 1998 audit of the Department of Defense, GAO, the official auditors for the U.S. Congress, could not match more than $22 billion in DoD expenditures with obligations; it could not find over $9 billion in inventory; and it documented millions in overpayments to contracts. GAO concluded that ``no major part of DoD has been able to pass the test of an independent audit.'' Throwing good money after bad without accountability is not the answer. 
   Instead, Mr. President, we will sharply increase defense spending. The fiscal year 1999 DoD authorization bill assumed a budget of $250.6 billion. Since that time, the Congress has added $17 billion in emergency spending for defense. That spending boost is not offset and takes money directly from the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   Mr. President, we have done a tremendous job of eliminating our budget deficit. We're staring a huge budget surplus in the face, but we can't seem to handle the temptation to spend it. To spend it before we address Social Security and Medicare is irresponsible, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, a large part of that success has been due to the willingness of both the Congress and the President to do more with less, to trim excessive spending wherever possible and maintain important services with fewer resources. We have begun to succeed in many areas of government--education, health care, veterans' care, welfare benefits, environmental programs--but not in defense spending, where we continue to build destroyers the Navy does not ask for and continue to build bombers the Air Force does not want. This bill continues this sad tradition. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas again for his leadership on this critical issue. 
   S. Res. 103 marks the 10th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when a still unknown number of Chinese--some say hundreds, others, thousands--died at the hands of the People's Liberation Army. 
   Despite the significance of this tragedy, China's leaders remain unwilling to re-examine the events of June 4, 1989. Indeed, they would like nothing more than to have Tiananmen fade from the world's memory. 
   But today, the memory of Tiananmen remains vivid in our minds. In particular, we remember one man who defined the spirit of the day as he stood, with only freedom at his side, and faced down an army tank. We saw him then, and as we think of Tiananmen Square today, we see him still. 
   The memory of Tiananmen refuses to fade because the human rights situation in China remains abysmal. According to Amnesty International more than 200 individuals may remain in Beijing prisons for their role in the 1989 demonstrations. And hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals continue to be detained or imprisoned for their political or religious beliefs. 
   We face many issues with China--the recent embassy bombing, accession to the WTO, charges of espionage--but we can not let these issues silence our voices on the subject of human rights. 
   China's human rights practices continue to be abhorrent, and we should not allow recent events to diminish our continued vigilance on such practices. 
   It is noteworthy that the recent demonstrations in China against the United States are perhaps the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests exactly 10 years ago. It is ironic that public protest is OK when it serves the government's interest, and not OK when it threatens the government's hold on power. 
   In fact, since the end of the bombing-related anti-U.S. demonstrations, China has resumed its crackdown on dissidents who could attempt to commemorate the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
   The failure to adopt a resolution condemning China's human rights practices at last month's UN Commission on Human Rights makes it all the more urgent that we continue to demand improvements in China's policies. 
   We cannot betray the sacrifices made by those who lost their lives in Tiananmen Square by tacitly condoning through our silence the abuses that continue to this day. 
   This resolution reminds the leaders in Beijing that we will not forget what was done 10 years ago and will not look the other way when they again deny the Chinese people their rights. 
   Until we see genuine progress on human rights, the memory of Tiananmen Square will continue to haunt us. 
   We must not forget. And we must never let the rulers in Beijing forget.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution designating June 5, 1999, as ``Safe Night USA.'' Safe Night USA is an exciting program that is helping reduce youth violence, as well as drug and alcohol abuse, in my home state of Wisconsin and around the nation. 
   Safe Night is a low cost, high-profile way to focus national attention on the importance of providing young people with safe alternative activities and tools for conflict resolution, anger management and mediation. I am proud to report Mr. President that Safe Night first began in 1994 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and in 1999 all fifty states, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands will participate in this exciting program. 
   Mr. President, Olusegun Sijuwade, a Milwaukee Health Department educator and former police officer, developed Safe Night in response to more than 300% increase in violent death and injury in Milwaukee between 1983 and 1993. The Safe Night program in Wisconsin began with 4,000 youth in Milwaukee and by 1996 involved more than 10,000 participants in over 100 sites spread across the state. And now, on June 5, 1999, a million kids are expected to participate in Safe Night programs in 1,200 sites across the country. 
   Mr. President, as you know, last week Congress debated and voted on the Juvenile Justice bill. The resolution I am introducing today is indeed timely and an appropriate response to the juvenile crime statistics we were reminded of last week. These include the over 220,000 juveniles arrested last year for drug abuse and the over 1,000,000 juvenile victims of a violent crime. I believe community-based violence prevention models, like Safe Night USA, are extremely important to stem the rise in juvenile crime. By educating youth, community leaders and parents, Safe Night promotes secure environments for kids and families while reducing the alienation that so often leads to violent crime and substance abuse. 
   Very simply, Mr. President, Safe Night brings community partners together to provide a place for youth to have fun during high-risk evening hours, with three ground rules; no guns, no drugs and no fighting allowed. A typical Safe Night consists of a party, planned by kids and adults in the community, including police officials, church leaders, doctors, teachers, parents, and other volunteers. Held at a school, a church, or a community center, a Safe Night event could have a dance with a disc jockey, an athletic event, or a large dinner, usually interspersed with targeted violence-reduction activities. These activities include role playing, trust-building games, and other methods of teaching kids stress management and alternatives to violence. 
   Safe Night USA 1999 will occur in both rural and urban areas. The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the Black Entertainment Television (BET) Network will broadcast the events nationally. The following community partners have joined with Safe Night USA: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Civics League, 100 Black Men of America, the Resolving Conflict Creatively Center and Educators for Social Responsibility, American Academy of Pediatrics, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America and the National 4-H Youth Council. 
   Mr. President, it is critical that both families and communities understand that we are not powerless to help prevent destructive behaviors, such as drug abuse, in our children. Safe Night USA helps develop a strong, committed partnership between schools, community and families to foster a drug-free and violence-free environment for our youth. I believe Mr. President that Safe Night USA is a wise investment up front--it is a simple idea that works--and I am proud that it originated in my home state of Wisconsin. I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in passing this resolution and I wish the 10,000 local Safe Night USA events great success on June 5, 1999, as they join in one nationwide effort to combat youth violence and substance abuse. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for what he is trying to do with his amendment, to protect the prerogatives of the Senate and the requirements of the War Powers Resolution with respect to the actions of our armed services abroad. Although I understand it may be modified, I think I will be able to support this amendment. I share the Senator's commitment to protecting the war powers granted to the Congress by the Founding Fathers and reaffirmed in the War Powers Resolution. 
   That said, I hope that, should this amendment be adopted, the conferees will make an effort to better define the term ``peacekeeping,'' for which the Senator has made an exception in his amendment. I believe that all military deployments, subject to the exceptions laid out in the War Powers Resolution including peacekeeping operations, should receive authorization of the Congress. And, since there currently is no peace to keep in Kosovo--and in fact NATO continues air strikes to this day--I hope that the Congress will define the parameters of such an exception more specifically. 
   Mr. President, today is May 25, 1999, and in the context of the Senator's amendment I want to take the opportunity to remind the Senate of the significance of today's date. 
   Exactly 62 days ago, U.S. forces, as part of a NATO force, began air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   Today marks the expiration of the 60-day time period after which the President--under the provisions of the War Powers Resolution--is required to withdraw our Armed Forces from their participation in the air strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
   Exactly 60 days ago--48 hours after the air strikes began--the President was required under section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution to submit a detailed report to the Congress regarding the actions he ordered our troops to take. 
   No such report has been submitted. Rather, the Congress was notified of the U.S. participation in the NATO air strikes by a letter from the President that he 
   says is--``consistent''--with the War Powers Resolution.'' 
   ``Consistent'' or not, I do not believe that the President's letter satisfies the requirements of the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, in my view, the War Powers Resolution stands as the law of the land, and the President should comply with it. So it follows, then, that if the President fails to withdraw our troops by midnight tonight--and of course it is clear that they will remain in the region long after the clock strikes twelve--the President will be in violation of the provisions of the War Powers Resolution. 
   I find it disturbing that this important date of May 25 will come and go with no action to remove our troops from the region. Indeed, I am afraid that this Congress is ignoring the significance of this date completely. In fact, I am not sure that the significance of this date has been noted by any of my colleagues during debate on this Specter amendment. 
   The War Powers Resolution provides that the President shall terminate the use of our Armed Forces for the purpose outlined in the report required under section 4(a)(1) of the Act after 60 days unless one of the three things has happened: 
   The Congress has declared war or has enacted a specific authorization for the use of the military; the Congress has extended by law the 60-day time period; or the President is not able to withdraw the forces because of an armed attack against the United States. 
   In addition, the President may extend this time period by 30-days if he certifies in writing to the Congress that it is unsafe to withdraw the forces at the end of the 60 days. 
   Sixty days have come and gone, Mr. President, and none of these things has happened. 
   The Congress has not declared war, nor has it authorized this action. 
   The Congress has not extended the 60-day time period. 
   The United States has not been attacked. 
   The President has not certified in writing to the Congress that an additional 30 days are necessary to ensure the safe withdrawal of our troops. 
   As my colleagues know, I voted against the ongoing NATO air strikes against the FRY, and I am deeply troubled that U.S. participation in them continues despite the fact that Congress was divided on whether to authorize them. In addition, the resolution which this body adopted and on which the other body deadlocked was not a joint resolution that would have authorized the military action, by law. 
   No, Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 21 is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that does not carry the force of law. 
   The Senate also considered a joint resolution offered by the Senator from Arizona [Mr. MCCAIN] which, if adopted by both Houses of Congress, would have given the President the specific statutory authorization required under the War Powers Resolution to continue the use of our Armed Forces in the action against the FRY. In fact, Mr. President, that sweeping resolution would have allowed the President to expand this participation as he saw fit. While I opposed this resolution, I am pleased that the Senate debated it and voted on it as we unequivocally were obliged to do under the War Powers Resolution. 
   I am afraid that the debate and votes on the participation of the United States in Kosovo both here in the Senate, as well as in the other body, reflect the fact that there is no consensus in the Congress or in the country with regard to what we have already done in Kosovo, let alone a consensus on whether to expand the U.S. mission there. 
   Sixty days have come and gone since the President failed to submit the required report regarding U.S. participation in the air strikes against the FRY. Despite this regrettable inaction, the War Powers Resolution clock began to tick 48 hours after the first bombs fell--the date on which the President's report under section 4(a)(1) of the Act was required to have been submitted. That's right, Mr. President, the clock begins to tick whether the President fulfills his obligation to submit the report or not. The vitality of the War Powers Resolution is unmistakable because that law states that the troops must be removed ``..... within 60 calendar days after a report is submitted or is required to be submitted pursuant to section 4(a)(1). .....'' unless one of the actions I mentioned earlier has occurred. 
   As the clock draws closer to midnight today, the sixtieth day, our troops are performing admirably under hostile conditions. But time has almost run out on the President to fulfil this legal obligations under the War Powers Resolution. 
   Despite the fact that many in Congress oppose the current air campaign, and despite the fact that our troops will soon be participating in this campaign in violation of the War Power Resolution, members of this body last week adopted a massive spending package in support of a military action that many of them oppose. I support fully our efforts to give our men and women in the field everything they need to maximize their chances of success and to minimize the risks they face. 
   Still, I voted against that package, both because of my continuing concern over our unauthorized military involvement in the FRY and because of the non-emergency spending that was jammed into the so-called emergency bill. 
   So we are not at a critical juncture, Mr. President. The Congress has voted to fund a military mission that it has not authorized, and the President has signed this bill even though he knows, as we know, that the continued participation of our troops in this mission is in violation of the War Powers Resolution. 
   One way or the other, consistent with the safety of our troops, it is time for the President to comply with the War Powers Resolution by seeking--and gaining--the legal authorization of Congress to continue this war, or by withdrawing our forces.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from West Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments on the emergency spending bill we have before us. Many of us had hoped that the almost grotesque experience of last year's omnibus appropriations bill might have shamed Congress into refraining from the kind of fiscally irresponsible spending and catering to special interests that characterized that legislation. Apparently, it was a vain hope. We are back at the same disgraceful work barely seven months later. 
   Mr. President, few would argue the need for many of the core provisions of the legislation, especially the urgently needed humanitarian relief in Central America, our current military and humanitarian operations in the Balkans, and for victims of natural disasters here at home. Regrettably, those legitimate provisions are completely eclipsed by dozens of others that are at best highly questionable and at worst grossly irresponsible. 
   Mr. President, first and foremost among this latter group are the billions in additional funding for the military that was not requested by the administration. 
   Mr. President, to say there is a double standard when it comes to fiscal prudence in Congress is to say the ocean is damp. We saw it last year in the omnibus appropriations bill, we saw it again when this body took up and passed an unfunded military pay and retirement increase even before we had passed a budget resolution, we saw it still again during the budget resolution when military spending received a special exemption from the tough new emergency spending rules we adopted, and sadly, we see it now in this bill. 
   As has been noted by others, including my distinguished colleague from the other House, Wisconsin Representative DAVID OBEY, what we are probably witnessing is an effort to load as  much military spending into this bill under the pretext of an emergency in order to make room for special interest military spending provisions in the Defense appropriations bill later this summer. 
   Mr. President, put simply, this emergency supplemental measure uses Social Security Trust Fund revenues to help lard up an already corpulent defense budget. 
   Almost as troubling as this reckless use of Social Security revenues to pay for the military budget is that this technique isn't an exception. It has become the custom. 
   Mr. President, our budget caps have become a sham. We agree to those tough caps with great acclaim and fanfare, only to circumvent them casually on a regular basis with the emergency provisions of our budget rules. 
   Mr. President, as much as I oppose raising the budget caps, it would be far better if Congress and the White House were to raise those caps in an honest and open manner, than to continue the pretense that the caps have meaning only to circumvent them through the abuse--I say ``abuse''--of the emergency funding designation. 
   Mr. President, while the doubling of the military budget request is certainly the dominant flaw in this bill, there are other provisions that deserve notice as well. They represent what is most unseemly about the emergency appropriations process--special interest provisions that relate to no true emergency, but avoid the scrutiny of the normal legislative process and instead capitalize on human suffering or an international crisis, finding their way onto what we have come to call must-pass bills. 
   Mr. President, let me note that it may be that some of these extraneous provisions have merit. But they should be subject to the same fiscal scrutiny we ask of any proposal. They should be paid for. The standing committees should review and authorize these proposals, and the Appropriations Committee should propose a level of funding for each of them that makes sense in the context of the overall budget. 
   Mr. President, by circumventing this process, the advocates of these provisions reveal their distrust of Congress and possibly their own apprehension that their provisions may not be able to gain passage on their merits. 
   One such provision is the so-called Russian Leadership Program, a new program, Mr. President, newly authorized by this legislation which also provides it with $10 million in funding. I understand the program is intended to enable emerging political leaders of Russia to live here in the United States for a while to gain firsthand exposure to our country, our free market system, our democratic institutions, and other aspects of our government and day-to-day lives. 
   Mr. President, offhand, that doesn't sound like it is necessarily a bad idea. I might be able to support such a program, though I would certainly want to know something more about it before endorsing still another new democracy building effort. But, Mr. President, this proposal has not gone through the normal legislative process. It has not been held up to the scrutiny of a public review by the appropriate committees. 
   Mr. President, if one were asked where the new Russian Leadership Program were to be housed, one might reasonably guess somewhere in the State Department, perhaps in USAID. Those a bit more familiar with the array of duplicate programs we have might stroke their chin wisely and suggest that it would probably be included in the National Endowment for Democracy, a quasi-governmental agency that many of us believe duplicates services provided elsewhere in government. 
   But, Mr. President, if you guessed the State Department, or NED, you would be wrong. For the next year, this new Russian Leadership Program is to be housed in the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, as some may know, we already have numerous educational and other exchange programs with Russia. Agencies and Departments which have received funding from the Congress for exchange programs with Russia include, but are not limited to: the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Education, Justice, State, and Treasury; the Agency for International Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Trade Commission, the Marine Mammal Commission, the National Aeronautics and Space Commission, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Science Foundation, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Peace Corps. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the tremendous impact that educational cultural exchanges have had on our relationship with Russia. I have to wonder if we really need to create still another exchange program. Even if we determine that the program has great merit, I think serious questions can be raised about whether this ought to be administered by the Library of Congress. 
   It doesn't end there. According to the authorizing language in this legislation, the Librarian of Congress is given authority to waive any competitive bidding when entering into contracts to carry out this program. In other words, this program is effectively shielded from any expertise or efficiencies that might be brought to bear by existing firms or nongovernmental agencies with experience in this area. 
   There we have it: In this bill, a brand-new program that has completely avoided the review of the appropriate standing committees established in an agency, that is wholly inappropriate, with virtually no restrictions on its administration. This is a heck of a way to legislate. 
   Of course, this is just one example, one of dozens of extraneous provisions that have been slipped into this emergency supplemental bill. I am not talking about a lot of different bills; it is just what is going on in this bill. 
   As others have noted, these unrelated riders have become business as usual. This is especially true with respect to antienvironmental policy. This is not the first time I have expressed concerns regarding legislative riders in appropriations legislation that would have a negative impact on our Nation's environment. I am sorry to say with respect to one of these policies, the delaying of the implementation of new mining regulations, this is not even the first time such a rider has been inserted into an appropriations bill. 
   The merits of this policy, this very important policy relating to mining, should be debated at length on another occasion. I do want to note that the rules that safeguard our public lands with respect to mining badly need updating, if only to keep pace with the changing mining technology. One such technique, the use of sulfuric acid mining, caused grave concern 2 years ago in my own State when it was appropriated for use in private lands in the neighboring Upper Peninsula of Michigan. 
   Regulations also need to take into account other land uses that would be displaced by mining, and they need to do more to require meaningful cleanup. Currently, there is no requirement to restore mine lands to premining conditions. This leaves taxpayers holding the bag for the mining industry's mistakes. 
   Obviously, this kind of a change requires a full, careful, and open debate. It just can't get the kind of attention it needs when it is quietly slipped into an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that we are only going to debate for 3 hours. Of course, that is precisely the reason the advocates of the rider have done it this way. They see their opportunity. They don't want a full and careful and open debate--special interests that push this policy know it will do them best and they will get it done best behind closed doors, away from the light of open debate. 
   In this connection, I think my colleagues should be aware that the PACs associated with the members of the National Mining Association and other mining-related PACs contributed more than $29 million to congressional campaigns from January 1993 to December 1998. Mining soft money contributions totaled $10.6 million during the same 6-year period. Mr. President, that is nearly $40 million in campaign contributions in recent years from an industry that stands to benefit from this rider that has been stuffed in this bill which we are only going to debate for 3 hours. 
   And so it is with too many of these provisions. 
   It should come as no surprise that a process characterized by secret negotiations and backroom deals should be  dominated by special interests and produce such questionable policy. These interests have succeeded in presenting Congress with a take-it-or-leave-it deal, and they are betting we will acquiesce for fear of delaying the true emergency assistance that I and everyone else have said is truly urgently needed. 
   Of course, I realize this measure is likely to pass. I hope it does not. But I cannot endorse this package or the process that brought it to the floor by voting for it. I ask my colleagues to consider calling the bluff of the interests that have succeeded in loading this bill up with extraneous matters that could never command a majority in Congress on their own. 
   If we can defeat this measure and insist on a clean, true emergency bill, we just might be able to shame those who have participated in crafting it and maybe even prevent this kind of abuse in the future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I supported Senator GRAMM's point of order because, while some of the spending programs in this bill may have merit, they should not be funded by Social Security Trust Fund balances. The point of order would not prevent these programs from being funded, but would force Congress to find adequate offsetting spending cuts to pay for those programs, or those spending cuts would be imposed automatically at the end of the fiscal year.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN. I would like to take this moment to highlight one element of Senator BIDEN's amendment, the extension and expansion of the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program. 
   I have heard one consistent theme throughout the debate on this juvenile justice bill: a desire to stop, once and for all, the senseless schoolhouse shootings like those that occurred in Littleton, Jonesboro and Paducah. There is a growing sense among Americans that we are no longer safe in our homes, in our schools, in our communities. But while we have heard sharply disparate views about issues like gun control and content of video games in the debate so far, one sure way to reduce crime and restore peace of mind is through community oriented policing. 
   As you are aware, the COPS Program was established in 1994 to put more police officers on the streets and to encourage police interaction with the communities in which they work. This program is a shining example of an effective partnership between local and federal governments. It provides federal assistance to meet local objectives. It does not interfere with local prerogatives; it does not impose mandates. The program provides funding to counties, towns and cities to enable communities to put more police on the street. Individual police and sheriff's departments have discretion over how those funds are used, because they know what problems their communities face and the places they need help most. 
   COPS has had a positive, and very tangible, impact on communities throughout the country, including in my home state of Wisconsin, by putting more police officers on our streets and making our citizens safer. In the state of Wisconsin alone, COPS has funded over 1,100 new officers and contributed more than $70 million to communities to make it happen. The COPS Program has succeeded because it helps individual officers to be a friendly and familiar presence in their communities. They are building relationships with people from house to house, block to block, school to school. This community policing helps the police to do their job better, makes the neighborhoods and schools safer and, very importantly, gives residents peace of mind. 
   Let me illustrate the strong causal relationship between community oriented policing and a reduction in the crime rate. I would like to share with you the story of Chief Jeff Lieberman of Fountain City, Wisconsin. Chief Lieberman polices a small town with big city crime problems. Chief Lieberman moved to Fountain City in 1992 and was faced with an alarming juvenile crime rate. What could he do to decrease the juvenile crime rate? While jails were being built and sentences were being stiffened, Chief Lieberman reached out to the community. He embarked upon a crusade to visit classrooms and teach children about law enforcement and safety. To allow the children to relate to him as they would to any other person and feel comfortable talking to him, he would sometimes dress in shorts and bring his dog to class. Not only has he won their respect, the children now show greater respect for their community. This success is reflected by the fact that during his tenure, he has reduced the juvenile crime rate by an astonishing 99%. 
   Chief Lieberman has earned a reputation in the community as a caring and compassionate citizen, as well as an outstanding law enforcement officer. I might add that Chief Lieberman was recently recognized for his effective community oriented policing by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund as the March 1999 Officer of the Month. 
   I do not believe the answer to the tragedies in Littleton, Jonesboro and Paducah is one extreme or the other--a ban on all guns or censorship of the entertainment industry. The answer is to educate our young people, nurture them, protect them and give them thousands more ``Chief Liebermans'' across this country. Senator BIDEN's bill does just that. It provides for expanding the much-lauded COPS Program to ensure that we have 30,000 to 50,000 ``Chief Liebermans'' in schools, towns and cities across, not only Wisconsin, but the entire nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment and continuing our drive to put more police officers on the streets and in touch with their communities. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to S. 254, the Juvenile Justice Bill. I oppose this bill because it does far more harm than good to the fundamental interests of our nation's children. 
   The bill fails to do what the Littleton tragedy screams out loudly and clearly we should do: strive to prevent future schoolhouse tragedies and all juvenile violence. The bill is long on prosecution and detention but short on prevention. 
   During debate on this bill, I was glad to see that some of my concerns were resolved. After a contentious debate, the Senate finally closed the gun show loophole. The Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment is a sensible regulation on the sale of guns at gun shows. It does not prevent law-abiding citizens from selling and buying guns at gun shows. 
   The Senate's debate on guns in the last week had what I believe to be a sensible outcome. But I do want to point out one thing about the debate we have had on various amendments to this bill dealing with the topic of gun control. Obviously, there are very strong feelings about gun-related amendments on both sides, and the issues are complex. But the vast majority of campaign contributions from groups interested in these amendments to the Senators who are voting on them is coming from one side. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, gave over $9 million to candidates, PACs, and parties from 1991 to 1998. The NRA gave $1.6 million in PAC contributions to federal candidates last year. Handgun Control, Inc. gave a total of $146,000. 
   With respect to Senator LAUTENBERG's amendment to close the gun show loophole last week, the Center found that those who voted against that amendment had received an average of over $10,478 from gun rights groups, while those who voted for it averaged only $297. I say this not to cast aspersions on any Senator's vote, but because I think the public record of our debate on these issues would be incomplete without this information. 
   There have been other improvements made in the bill as a result of the debate here on the floor and negotiations among Senators and the Managers. The final bill now reasonably protects the privacy of juvenile offender records. The amendment to ensure the separation of children from adult prisoners in mixed prison settings also was adopted. 
   This good work, however, is not enough to undo the harm that this bill will do to our nation's children. 
   We have strong evidence that prevention reduces crime. According to the Children's Defense Fund, in the first year after the Baltimore Police Department opened an after-school program in a high-crime area, crime in that neighborhood dropped 42%. Cincinnati's crime rate dropped 24% since it instituted violence prevention, education, social and recreation programs. And in Fort Worth, Texas, gang-related crime dropped by 26% as a result of a gang reduction program. 
   Now, the Hatch-Biden amendment takes us part of the way there by allowing 25% of funding for juvenile block grants to be allocated to prevention efforts. But frankly, that's not enough. We need to do more. Our children's future demands that we do more. 
   The Juvenile Justice bill emphasizes detention and intervention after juveniles have already gotten into trouble. The bill, however, does not provide sensible, adequate funding for prevention programs. Programs that will help to ensure that kids will not turn to crime and violence and will never have to experience handcuffs slapped on their wrists or the inside of a detention center. 
   This bill also deeply troubles me because it will put a halt to efforts to reduce discrimination in our juvenile justice system. The bill ignores reality: we are throwing African-American kids into jails at a higher rate than white kids who commit the exact same offense. This phenomenon is called disproportionate minority confinement. 
   Our Nation has come a long way toward achieving racial harmony and  equality, but we still have a long way to go. In nearly every state, children of minority racial and ethnic backgrounds are over-represented at every stage of the juvenile justice system and receive harsher treatment by the system. A California study has shown that black youths 
   consistently receive harsher punishment and are more likely to receive jail time than white youths convicted of the same offenses. Current law requires states to identify disproportionate minority confinement in their states, to analyze why it exists and to develop strategies to address the causes of disproportionate minority confinement. The law does not require and has never resulted in the release of juveniles. Nor does the law provide for quotas. And no state's funding under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act has ever been reduced as a result of non-compliance. 
   In fact, the current law has been very effective. Forty states are implementing or developing intervention plans to address disproportionate minority confinement. This bill will bring to a halt this good work conducted by the states. These states have just begun to address the disturbing reality of disproportionate minority confinement. But under this Juvenile Justice bill, the law enforcement community will no longer be required to address the problem of discriminatory treatment of minority juvenile offenders. This is outrageous. 
   I am outraged, and this body should be outraged, that we are punishing black kids more harshly than white kids for the exact same offenses. The debate on this issue illustrated how much more work we still need to do on civil rights. Many of my colleagues would have you believe that there is no longer a race problem in this country. I beg to differ. To those colleagues, I ask you to look around this chamber and identify for me the Senator of African descent. You cannot because there is not one. I am troubled that on this and other important civil rights issues, we do not have a member of the African-American community as one of our colleagues. I cannot help but think that our debate would have been better informed if we had the voice of an African-American Senator speaking at one of our podiums. I cannot help but think that the vote on the Wellstone-Kennedy amendment would have had a different outcome if we had the vote of an African-American Senator cast on this floor. 
   We have come a long way toward ridding our nation of discrimination against African Americans and other minorities. But we need to keep forging ahead for the good of our children and the future of our country. Let us not turn back the clock. 
   The bill also does more harm than good by shifting the burden to the child to show why he or she should be tried in a juvenile court, not as an adult. Under current law, federal judges, not prosecutors, decide whether a child will be tried as an adult after a full hearing. If the prosecutor believes that a child should be charged as an adult, the prosecutor goes to court and puts on evidence to establish why the child should be tried as an adult. This is called a ``waiver'' hearing. The prosecutor must show reason for the judge to waive the child into adult court. 
   Now, under the Juvenile Justice bill, the prosecutor would be able to charge children as young as 14 as adults if they have allegedly committed a felony. The child--not the prosecutor--would request a hearing to prove to the judge that he or should be treated as a child. 
   There is great wisdom in the current law. The decision to prosecute a child as an adult is a serious one that will profoundly impact that child's life and the sentence that will follow conviction. It is better to leave that decision to an impartial judge, not the prosecutor. 
   Finally, I must cast my vote against this bill because it creates yet another federal death penalty. The Senate unfortunately passed the Hatch-Feinstein amendment, which will allow imposition of the death penalty against persons who cause the death of another person during an act of animal enterprise terrorism. I have been, and continue to be, a strong, steadfast opponent of the death penalty. In my view, the death penalty is unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. And it is morally wrong for a civilized society to continue to impose this penalty. We should lock up offenders for life, but we should not take their lives. 
   In sum, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to heed the advice of skilled professionals who work with our youth every day. Organizations like the Children's Defense Fund, the Youth Law Center, the National Network for Youth have expressed their serious opposition to the bill. These organizations represent the thousands of people who are conducting effective after-school programs, providing counseling to troubled youth and other necessary services to our children at risk. In other words, these organizations are the experts. The experts believe that, although the bill is much improved over last year's juvenile justice bill and corrects some problems in the original bill as it came to the floor last week, the final bill is still a regressive solution to juvenile crime. 
   Let us put aside our partisanship for the sake of our children's and our Nation's future. I must oppose this juvenile justice bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator KOHL's amendment which was included into the Juvenile Justice bill's Manager's Package. Mr. President, Senator KOHL's amendment would expand the Families and Schools Together or FAST program to reach the many at-risk students in need. FAST is an award winning drug abuse prevention program that supports and empowers parents to be the best line of defense between their children and the dangers of drug abuse. The program uses a cooperative approach that gives parents professional support to prevent and confront drug abuse in the home. 
   I am proud to report, Mr. President, that the FAST program, which has received many awards and honors since its development 10 years ago, was founded in my home state of Wisconsin by Dr. Lynn McDonald. Dr. McDonald is one of the nation's experts on the prevention of drug abuse by young people. The unique FAST program is today being used in 484 schools in 34 states and five countries. 
   Research indicates that to be most effective, substance abuse prevention education should be initiated when children are young. Researchers also believe that prevention efforts that focus on family and peer relationships can greatly reduce risk factors for our children. While no one solution will rid our country of the problem of youth drug abuse, it is critical that we make available to students, parents and schools successful programs that can make a difference. FAST has a proven track record: it has been tried, adapted, implemented and studied. It is clearly a program that has proven successful and should be expanded to reach more families in need. 
   It is important to note, Mr. President, that we are not powerless to help prevent destructive behaviors, such as drug abuse, in our children. The FAST program requires a strong, committed partnership between schools and families to help the students at risk and to intervene successfully to prevent the downward cycle of drug abuse, which too often leads to youth violence. 
   I support this amendment, Mr. President, because I know that FAST is a prevention program which helps young children at risk for developing problems later on--by working with them and their families early on. Senator KOHL's amendment is a wise investment at the front end to catch students before their risky behavior results in tragic consequences for themselves and their families. With assistance from the FAST program, families become their own child's best prevention resource.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank you and especially thank the Senator from Minnesota for yielding me the time, but especially for his tremendous leadership on this issue, as well as Senator KENNEDY. 
   This amendment merely preserves the status quo with respect to the disproportionate minority confinement core requirement of the juvenile justice deliquency prevention formula grants. 
   Disproportionate minority confinement is a serious problem in many of our States, and has been for quite some time. Just as an example, in Pennsylvania, studies in the late 1980s showed that while minorities constituted only 12 percent of the juvenile population, they represented 27 percent of juveniles arrested and 48 percent of juveniles charged in court. In 1995, in Ohio, minorities comprised 14 percent of the state's juvenile population, but 30 percent of those arrested and 43 percent of those placed in secure correctional institutions. 
   And currently, nationwide, although African Americans constitute only 15 percent of the U.S. population of juveniles, they account for 26 percent of juvenile arrests, 46 percent of juveniles in secure corrections facilities, and 52 percent of juveniles transferred to adult criminal court after judicial hearings. 
   A study in California showed that minority youths consistently receive more severe sentences than white youths and are more likely than white youths to be committed to 
   State institutions for the same offenses. And here is another disturbing statistic: nationwide, African American males are 30 times--30 times--more likely to be detained in State juvenile facilities for drug offenses than white males. In Baltimore, African American males are roughly 100 times more likely to be arrested for drug offenses than white males. 
   These statistics are repeated across the country. I sincerely hope that this is a problem that everyone in this body is concerned about. And it is not just unfairness or discrimination in the juvenile system that should concern us. Because juvenile confinement often is the first step toward a lifetime of going through a revolving door between prison and freedom. Confinement has devastating effects on families as well, and provides tragic role models for even younger children. 
   We ought to be doing what we can to address these disparities. The DMC core requirement is not a panacea, but it has been working well in directing attention and resources at this problem. It does not and I repeat, it does not--require quotas in detention facilities or direct the release of any juvenile from custody. It simply requires States to develop plans to address the problem. 
   Since 1992, our States have been required to address DMC in their State plans. Some 40 states have completed the assessment phase and are implementing plans to try to address whatever problems they have identified. They are working on creative approaches, programs of education and vocational training, tutoring, dropout prevention, truancy intervention, and other efforts to keep at risk children in school. And States have been developing alternatives to incarceration for nonserious, nonviolent offenses. All of these things, developed at the state and local level, are positive efforts to address a serious social problem. We should be encouraging them, not undermining them by eliminating this core requirement, as the bill would do. 
   Mr. President, this is well worth the effort on this floor. Again, I strongly commend Senators WELLSTONE and KENNEDY for offering this amendment. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of S. Res. 103, which marks the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989, in China.  
   The resolution conveys the sense of the Senate that the United States expresses its sympathy for those killed at Tiananmen Square and commends the Chinese citizens who have continued over the last decade to peacefully advocate greater democracy and respect for human rights in China. This resolution further calls on the authorities in China to reevaluate the events of June 1989, establish a commission to investigate what happened, release those still being held in connection with the democratic rally, and cease current harassment and detention of those still seeking democratic reform. This resolution makes a simple, clear request, one that the Senate has made many times before--free the Tiananmen Square democratic protesters and accept the legitimacy of the voices that still cry out for peaceful democratic reform in China. 
   Mr. President, first I would like this opportunity to express my deep regret at the unfortunate, and unintentional, bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. Regardless of my continuing concerns with some of China's practices, I certainly feel great sorrow that innocent civilians were hurt under these circumstances. 
   Nevertheless, we can not, we will not, let this tragic accident, nor the impact it may have on our relations with China, silence our voices on the subject of democracy and human rights in China, or cause us to overlook the continuing ramifications of the events in Tiananmen Square ten years ago. China's human rights practices remain abhorrent, and we will not allow recent events to dampen our continued vigilance and willingness to condemn such practices. It is noteworthy that the demonstrations in China in reaction to the bombing are perhaps the largest since the Tiananmen Square protests. It is ironic that public protest is OK when it serves the government's interest, and not OK when it threatens the government's hold on power. This is an unacceptable double standard, and I believe we would be derelict in our duties if we did not keep our attention focused on the lack of freedom in China. 
   As we all know, this April, under considerable pressure from the Congress, the United States sponsored a resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to condemn China's ongoing abuses of human rights. As in past years, China's leaders aggressively lobbied against efforts at the Commission earlier and more actively than the countries that supported the resolution. Once again, Beijing's vigorous efforts have resulted in a ``no action'' motion at the Commission. While I commend the Administration's actions this year, I question whether our late and halfhearted support for condemnation of China doomed that resolution to failure. We must not allow China to believe that its human rights practices are acceptable. We must remember that if was only under the pressure of previous Geneva resolutions that China signed in 1997 the UN Covenant of Social Economic and Cultural Rights and in October 1998 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We should also not overlook the fact that neither of these important international documents has yet been ratified or implemented. 
   Mr. President, while recent attention has been drawn to the Embassy bombing, repeated allegations of espionage and of efforts to influence our elections, and the negotiations for China's entrance to the WTO, these current concerns should not obscure our views of the ongoing human rights abuses that abound throughout China and Tibet. According to Amnesty International, the human rights situation in China shows no fundamental change, despite the recent promises from the government of China. At least 2,000 people remain in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes that are no longer even on the books in China. At least 200 individuals detained or arrested for Tiananmen Square activities a decade ago are also still in prison. By China's own statistics, there are nearly a quarter of a million Chinese people imprisoned under the ``re-education through labor'' system. This situation demonstrates that China has yet to learn the lesson of Tiananmen Square--that the aspiration of the Chinese people for human rights and democratic reform will not disappear with time or repression. 
   On this, the tenth anniversary of the traumatic Tiananmen Square massacre, we must remember the brave Chinese citizens who stood before the tanks and gave their lives to express their hopes for freedom. They breathed their last on the bloody pavement of Tiananmen, hoping that their sacrifice would help bring democratic reform and respect for human rights to their fellow countrymen. We must continue to honor those who made such dramatic sacrifices for their beliefs. In this momentous year in which China marks not only the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen Square, but also the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we must not choose silence on this issue. Only by repeating our demands for change, can we appropriately honor those who were willing to sacrifice all to achieve a better life for the people of China. 
   Mr. President, I strongly commend my friends, the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. HUTCHINSON) and the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. WELLSTONE) for their leadership on this important, longstanding issue.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address a troubling--but little recognized--public health problem in this country, and that's access to dental health. 
   Unlike many public health problems, there are clinically proven techniques to prevent or delay the progression of dental health problems. These proven techniques are not only more cost-effective, but also are relatively simple if done early. I'm specifically referring to the use of fluoride and dental sealants. The combination of fluoride and sealants is so effective against tooth decay that it has been likened to a ``magic potion.'' In fact, an article in Public Health Reports called the ``one-two combination of fluoride and sealants . . . similar to that of vaccinations.'' 
   With such an effective prevention method in place, one might assume that dental disease is becoming increasingly rare in this country. But that's not the case, Mr. President, because, in order to receive these preventive treatments--this ``magic potion'' against dental disease--you need to see a dentist, and there simply are not enough dentists to provide these basic services to everyone who needs them. As of September 30 of last year, the United States had 1,116 dental health professions shortage areas, or Dental HPSA's according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. The chart I have here shows the counties in Wisconsin that have areas designated as shortage areas, but every single state in our Nation has a portion designated as a dental shortage area. 
   There are proven methods for preventing dental disease, yet 1,116 communities across our country--particularly underserved rural and inner-city communties--do not have enough dentists to provide simple preventive services. Barriers to dental care are particularly acute among lower income families, Medicaid enrollees, and the uninsured. Studies indicate that the prevalence of dental disease increases as income decreases. In many areas, there simply are not enough dentists to provide basic treatment to all who need them, and although there is a federal method for designating such areas as dental health professional shortage areas (DHPSA's) to become eligible for additional funding, the designation process can be so tedious that State dental directors simply lack the resources to complete the necessary documentation. 
   To illustrate this problem of undercounting shortage areas, as of September 30 of last year, only eight counties in Wisconsin had portions designated as DHPSA's according to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), but statewide only 23 percent of Medicaid enrollees had received dental care. As you can see from this chart, in 13 Wisconsin counties, fewer than 10 percent of Medicaid enrollees received dental care. According to Wisconsin's state dental director, Dr. Warren LeMay, 80 percent of tooth decay is found in the poorest 25 percent of children. Given the effectiveness of dental health care in preventing dental disease--particularly the combination of check-ups, fluoride, and sealants--the access problems are simply unacceptable. 
   And the impact of so many people going without dental care is devastating. Those of us who have ever had a toothache remember how excruciating that pain can be, making it difficult if not impossible to work, go to school or otherwise go about our business. For those Americans who lack access to dental services, however, the toothache is more than a bad memory--it is the here and now. 
   Mr. President, imagine you had a child, a daughter, in need of dental services. But you lack insurance, and cannot afford to pay out-of-pocket to see a dentist. Or you may have Medicaid, but the nearest dentist is more than 2 hours away, and you don't own a car. Since your child hasn't received the preventive care treatments, she has a lot of untreated tooth decay--decay that 
   leads to infection, fevers, stomach aches, and, worst of all, debilitating pain, making it almost impossible for her to concentrate in school. She may also develop speech difficulties, since she may lack the teeth necessary to form certain words and sounds. When you try to get her emergency dental services, you find that the few dentists in the area have waiting lists of two months or more. 
   Mr. President, one mother, from Rhinelander, WI--which is in Oneida County in the northern part of my state--called me to tell me about her 8-year-old daughter in just that situation. He daughter was in excruciating pain because of a severe toothache, but the one dental provider in the area had a waiting list of several weeks, so that mother had no choice but to take her child to the nearest hospital emergency room, where the child was given painkillers to use until she could be seen by a dentist. Whereas routine primary dental care could have prevented this decay altogether, this mother had to take her young child to the hospital emergency room for prescription painkillers in order to make the wait before seeing the dentist bearable. 
   Mr. President, the unfortunate reality is that I hear such stories from my constituents on a regular basis, and I have heard enough to know that it's time to stop this needless suffering from dental disease by increasing access to dental care. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, the Dental Health Access Expansion Act, will establish take three important steps to promote access to dental health services: 
   First, the bill creates a federal grant program to be administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration through which community health centers and local health departments in designated dental health professionals shortage areas can apply for funding to assist in the hiring of primary care dentists. Strengthening locally run dental access programs ensures a safety net for these vitally important services. 
   The bill also creates a grant program to give bonus payments to dentists in shortage areas who devote at least 25 percent of their practice to Medicaid patients. More than 90 percent of America's dentists are in private practice, and incentive payments for dentists to increase their Medicaid practice helps to bring needy patients into the dental care mainstream. 
   Finally, the bill requires that HRSA work with the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors and other organizations interested in expanding dental health access to simplify the process for designating dental shortage areas. Right now the system is so complicated that states simply don't have the resources to fill out the paperwork needed to get the designation. 
   Mr. President, the Dental Health Access Expansion Act is meant to complement existing initiatives--such as Health Professions Training Program expansions of general dentistry residencies, and the National Health Service Corps scholarship program--to increase access to primary care dental services in underserved communities. I have supported these and other programs in the past, and will continue to do so. My legislation is also meant to complement the excellent oral health initiatives proposed by my colleague, Senator BINGAMAN of New Mexico. I am thankful for the good work he has done in increasing awareness about this issue, and look forward to working with him to increase access to dental health services. 
   Through the legislation I am proposing, we can increase the number of dentists providing care to underserved communities, and in doing so strengthen our nation's existing network of Community Health Centers and local health departments. 
   Advances in dentistry have given us the tools to eradicate most dental diseases--what we need now is to provide people with access to dental care so that they can receive the simple preventive treatments they need, and that's what my legislation can help us achieve.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President. I am dismayed to report to the Senate that the situation in East Timor continued to deteriorate over the weekend. The violence has become so bad that courageous human rights activists, lawyers, health workers and others have been forced to go into hiding. There are reports that thousands of East Timorese are trapped inside what one observer has called a ``concentration camp.'' 
   This situation comes on the heels of several new developments. Last week, we had the unfortunate and ironic coincidence of several events on one day, Wednesday, May 5. On that day, the governments of Portugal and Indonesia, under the auspices of the United Nations, signed an agreement regarding the modalities of the planned August 8, 1999, vote on autonomy in East Timor. On that same day, the New York Times published a very significant op-ed by a key human rights lawyer, Aniceto Guterres Lopes, while at the same time, his house was surrounded by armed militias. And, still on the same day, I and several other Senators introduced S. Res. 96, a resolution to push for the Government of Indonesia to make a top priority the disarming of the very militias that seem to be terrorizing the region, among other actions.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator LEAHY, Senator KOHL, and Senator JEFFORDS to introduce this important legislation, the Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999. The Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999 will make our kid's nutrition--not some economic bottom line--the priority when it comes to our nation's school meal program. 
   Mr. President, some schools in this country, particularly high school, are providing school-aged children with free soda as part of the school lunch program. This trend is troublesome for a number of reasons: One, it is contrary to the intent of the 1946 National School Lunch Act; Two, numerous studies have demonstrated that teenagers, particularly girls, are not consuming enough calcium to prevent osteoporosis in their later years; And, three, as a representative of Wisconsin, ``America's Dairyland,'' I am concerned that the increase in school time soda consumption will inevitably mean that our children drink less milk at school. 
   Mr. President, in 1946, Congress first made nutrition for school aged children a priority when it passed the National School Lunch Act. This measure was designed to provide school children with high quality nutritious food during the school day. In 1977, because of concerns that our country's nutritional habits had begun to slide, Congress directed USDA to take steps to restrict school children's access to foods of low nutritional value when at school. 
   The legality regulations USDA promulgates under the 1977 law, with regard to foods of nutritional value was challenged by the National Soft Drink Association. This law banned the sale of soft drink and other ``junk foods'' in school cafeterias during the lunch hour. 
   Congressional debates on the 1977 law ``convey an unmistakable concern that `junk foods,' notably various types of candy bars, chewing gum and soft drinks, not be allowed to compete in participating schools.'' The Federal judge observed the ``logic and common sense, as well as several studies in the [rulemaking] record, suggest that irregular eating habits combined with ready access to junk food adversely affect federal nutritional objectives.'' 
   USDA current regulations prohibit the sale of foods of ``minimal nutritional value''--which include sodas, water ices, chewing gum, and certain candies--in the food service area during the lunch period in any school. The current regulations do not mention the distribution of free sodas, because, Mr. President, this idea never entered the  minds of lawmakers during consideration of the measure. 
   Mr. President, we have found that in schools all over the country, free sodas are being passed out as part of the school lunch program. This practice evades the current Federal ban on the sale of sodas as part of school lunches. It's bad for kids, bad for farmers who are watching milk consumption and prices decline, and bad for teachers and school administrators who are left to deal with unruly and fidgety children during the day. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, giving away free sodas in school doesn't help anybody except soda companies. 
   Mr. President, in a report published last year by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) it was documented that one quarter of teenage boys who drink soda consume more than two 12-ounce cans per day, and that five percent drink five or more cans daily. This report was based on survey data from USDA and also indicated that in average, girls drink about one-third less--but the risks of soda consumption are potentially greater for girls. The report claims that doctors say soda has been pushing milk out of teenage diets and making girls more likely candidates for osteoporosis when they're older. 
   The data indicated that these doctors are right. Choosing a soft drink instead of milk means that teens will have a lower level of calcium in their diets. Soft drinks provide 0% of a persons recommended daily allowance for calcium, while milk provides 30%. Low calcium intake contributes to osteoporosis, a disease leading to fragile and broken bones. Currently, 10 million Americans have osteoporosis while another 18 million have low bone mass and are at increased risk of osteoporosis. Women are more frequently affected than men. Considering the low calcium intake of today's teenage girls, osteoporosis rates may well rise in the near future. 
   As I understand it, the risk of osteoporosis depends in part on how much bone mass is built early on in life. The CSPI report states that girls build 92 percent of their bone mass by age 18, but if they don't consume enough calcium in the teenage years, they cannot ``catch up'' later. This explains why experts recommend higher calcium intakes for youths 9 to 18 than for adults 19 to 50. Currently, teenage girls consume only 60 percent of the recommended amount; pop drinkers consuming almost one-fifth less calcium than non-consumers. 
   The CSPI and a coalition of health advocates reported that 20 years ago, teens drank almost twice as much milk as soda pop; today, they consume twice as much soda as milk. 
   Since 1973, soft drink consumption has risen dramatically. Americans now drink twice as much soda per person as they did 25 years ago. According to statistics from the Beverage Marketing Corp., annual soda consumption was 22.4 per person in 1970; in 1998, it was 56.1 gallons per person. Unfortunately, milk consumption has been on a steady decline. This trend is likely to continue--however, I do not feel that school administrators should encourage it. This country's dairy farmers have it hard enough. The recently announced Basic Formula Price (BFP) is lower than the cost of production in nearly every region of the country. We in dairy states are very concerned about our struggling producers. How can we stand by and watch as they struggle to locate and enter new markets abroad, while their base market--school meal programs--is being taken away? 
   And how do the parents feel? Those that limit their children's intake of sodas and sweets at home see their efforts undermined when the school provides these items for free. This is a losing battle for them too! 
   Mr. President, I'm not here to ban soda for school-age children--only to support a simple, sensible idea that any parent, any nutritionist, and any dairy farmer would favor--and that's giving our kids milk while they are in school. This bill restores common sense back to one aspect of our kids school nutrition programs. I urge my colleagues to support this Better Nutrition for School Children Act of 1999. It is supported by the National Education Association and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Education. I ask that their letters of support be inserted into the RECORD.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer a few comments about one of the most important issues we have considered as part of the so-called financial modernization debate, namely the Community Reinvestment Act or CRA. It gives me particular pleasure to discuss CRA because it was authored by the former Senator from Wisconsin and Senate Banking Committee Chair, William Proxmire. CRA is over twenty years old now, and by all accounts it has been a success. 
   Banks have a special role in our free market system; they are the rationers of capital. For this reason and others we grant banks a number of special privileges, such as public charters, taxpayer-backed deposit insurance, and access to the discount window at the Federal Reserve. CRA is grounded in the philosophy that we grant these privileges in part to assure that banks will serve the public--all of the public in all parts of our communities. 
   In the context of last week's debate over so-called financial services modernization, the concept that we should require banks to actively find lending opportunities in communities they serve is all the more appropriate. The globalization of financial services, and the new structures proposed for financial institutions, increasingly means local institutions have ever expanding and increasingly distant opportunities for their loan portfolios. CRA serves as a reminder that ultimately we grant rights and privileges to banks in part to ensure consumers and businesses in our communities have access to financial services. 
   I have been interested in CRA since the early 1980s when I became Chair of the Banking Committee in the Wisconsin State Senate, and while it is not perfect, CRA has clearly helped give under served communities increased access to financial services. And it has done a great deal to foster economic development, both for individual families, and for neighborhoods and communities through home ownership and community development financing. 
   As noted in a recent report by the Wisconsin Rural Development Center,  for many low-income and minority groups, home ownership is a way out of poverty. Equity built through home ownership can be used to finance a start-up business, pay for a college education, fund a secure retirement or consolidate high interest rate debt. The report went on to note that home ownership in low-income neighborhoods can provide stability, increase pride and property values, and attract new capital. 
   CRA has helped foster access to financial services in each of these areas. Commitments by banks to home ownership, small business, and community development has increased because of CRA. According to 1997 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, lending to minority and low income borrowers is increasing. Since 1993, the number of home mortgage loans to African Americans increased by 58 percent, to Hispanics by 62 percent, and to low and moderate income borrowers by 38 percent. 
   In 1997, financial institutions subject to CRA reporting requirements made 2.6 million small business loans for a total of $159 billion, two-thirds of small business loans made that year, and more than one-fifth of those loans were made to small businesses in low and moderate income communities. 
   And, in 1997, large commercial banks made $18.6 billion in community development investments. 
   Altogether, nonprofit community organizations estimate that since 1992 the private sector has pledged over $1 trillion in loans going forward for affordable home ownership and community development. 
   I have no doubt that CRA was responsible in great part for this record. And neither does Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan. At a House Banking Committee hearing earlier this year, Chairman Greenspan testified that CRA has ``very significantly increased the amount of credit in these communities'' and that changes have been ``quite profound.'' 
   It is important to note that CRA has succeeded in encouraging banks to serve those who have been financially under served without jeopardizing the safety and soundness of the institution. As Robert Kuttner has noted, in the decade after CRA, we learned that financial institutions often make costly mistakes, but lenders faltered in the 1980s not by being too kind to the inner city, but by making speculative loans in remote locations they knew little about, and by competing recklessly for market share. By comparison, the local Jimmy Stewart type loan looked pretty solid. 
   As Chairman Greenspan noted, ``there is little or no evidence that banks' safety and soundness have been compromised by (low- and moderate-income) lending and bankers often report sound business opportunities.'' 
   In fact, CRA is a tool that can help banks. As former Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence Lindsey said, ``CRA-related activities can help develop new markets, potentially profitable business, and improve a bank's public image.'' 
   Let me note that there have been some improvements to CRA. In response to the very real problems facing many smaller community banks, a streamlined CRA process was approved a few years ago, and I was proud to support those changes and I understand the paperwork burden on smaller banks has been reduced as a result. Over 80 percent of banks covered by CRA qualify for the streamlined performance standards for small banks and thrifts, and I understand that actual time spent in community banks on CRA examinations has been reduced by 30 percent. 
   CRA has helped improve financial services for under served communities, but there is still significant room for improvement. Many still have few financial options, and as the Wisconsin Rural Development Center has found, in the absence of adequate financial services from traditional lenders, there has been an increase in so-called subprime or predatory lending from lenders who target homeowners with less than perfect credit with high-cost, sometimes fraudulent, mortgage servicing products. 
   We owe a great deal to Senator Proxmire and his creation. As we consider legislation to change the structure of our financial institutions, we must not lose sight of the original goals of CRA, namely that those institutions which enjoy the special privileges and protections afforded by the government have an obligation to ensure that the entire community has access to financial services.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the closing of the United States Army School of the Americas, located at Fort Benning, Georgia. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 873, a bill to close this troubled school once and for  all, which was introduced recently by the Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN. 
   The School of the Americas (SOA) was created in 1946 to train Latin American military officers in combat and counterinsurgency skills with the goal of professionalizing Latin American armies and strengthening democracies. Originally located in Panama, SOA moved to Fort Benning in 1984. There has been a great deal of controversy surrounding some of SOA's alumni, leading it to be called ``the School for Dictators.'' Some of SOA's notorious graduates include Manuel Noriega, Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri, at least 19 Salvadorean officers implicated by El Salvador's Truth Commission in the murder of six Jesuit priests, and two of the three officers prosecuted in Guatemala for their roles in the murder of anthropologist Myrna Mack. 
   In 1991, following an internal investigation, the Pentagon removed certain SOA training manuals from circulation. On September 22, 1996, the Pentagon released the full text of those training manuals and acknowledged that some of those manuals provided instruction in techniques that, in the Pentagon's words, were ``clearly objectionable and possibly illegal.'' The ``techniques'' in question included such awful activities as torture, extortion, false arrest, and execution. 
   Not only are the human costs of this training program unjustifiable, but so are its financial costs. When I first ran for this body in 1992, I included the School of the Americas as an item on my 82+ point plan for deficit reduction. With a national debt in excess of $5 trillion, we must carefully scrutinize every program to ensure that federal tax dollars are wisely spent. We certainly do not need to spend taxpayer dollars on this kind of activity. 
   Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have been contacted by hundreds of Wisconsinites who support closing the School of the Americas. Just this week, a number of Wisconsin residents joined scores of individuals from around the country at a protest here in Washington, D.C., against the continued operation of the school. The group from my home state included students, human rights activists, and members of several religious communities. I am pleased that so many Wisconsin residents are committed to working toward the closing of this school. 
   Numerous organizations, including Public Citizen, the Washington Office on Latin America and Human Rights Watch also support the elimination of SOA. 
   As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am committed to promoting human rights throughout the world. In my view, our government cannot continue to support the existence of a school that counts so many murderers among its alumni. While it may be appropriate for the United States military to train its colleagues from other nations, it is inexcusable that this training should take place at an institution with a reputation as far beyond salvage as that of the School of the Americas. This legislation gives members of this body the opportunity to separate the legitimate training exercises conducted by the United States military from the sordid acts of many individuals who have been trained at SOA. We must lift the cloud of suspicion that has fallen on these programs by closing SOA. 
   I am pleased that S. 873 includes language expressing the sense of the Congress that all foreign military training conducted by the United States should stress respect for human rights, the proper role of the military in a democratic society, and accountability and transparency in defense and security policy. This is an excellent opportunity for the Congress, which has oversight responsibilities for military training programs, to reiterate the importance of these basic principles to the Administration, the American people, and perspective candidates for military training from other countries. 
   The bill also calls on the Department of Defense to vigorously screen all candidates for military training programs to ensure that they have not been implicated in human rights abuses, corruption, or drug trafficking. 
   I urge my colleagues to support S. 873 and close the ``School for Dictators'' once and for all.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my friends, Senator KERRY of Massachusetts and Senator WELLSTONE of Minnesota, and commend them on the introduction of their campaign finance reform proposal, the Clean Money bill. I am very pleased that they are once again introducing this far reaching and visionary piece of legislation. I think it is important as we deal in this Senate with the more limited bill that I have proposed with the Senator from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, that the American people understand that we do not believe that the job will be completed if that bill becomes law. 
   Of course, I also want to thank Senators KERRY and WELLSTONE for their strong support of the McCain-Feingold bill. I also want to make it very clear that these two pieces of legislation are completely consistent and complimentary. The Clean Money bill introduced today contains the central components of the McCain-Feingold and Shays-Meehan bills--a soft money ban, provisions to deal with phony issue ads, and improved enforcement and disclosure. But it adds a comprehensive system of financing Senate campaigns, based on initiatives that have been endorsed by the voters in Maine, Massachusetts, and Arizona for their state elections, to provide public funding to qualified candidates for state officeholders. 
   Mr. President, when I first ran for the Wisconsin State Senate many years ago, my race would literally not have been possible were it not for Wisconsin's system of partial public financing. Under the state system in effect at that time, I had to raise approximately $17,500 from friends and family, and the state election fund provided a grant of the same amount. So once I raised my share, my fundraising work was done, and I could spend my time going door to door campaigning. I won that first race by only a few votes, and I'm convinced that my retail campaigning was the difference. So I believe it is fair to say that I wouldn't be  in the United States Senate today if Wisconsin didn't have that system of public financing, that allowed a person of limited means to run for office, and win. 
   Today, all over the country, citizens are coming to realize that the money chase that is required to run for office is depriving them of good candidates and representatives. Not everyone who would be a hardworking and effective public servant comes from a wealthy background or from a community of friends or business associates who can finance a campaign. And so the Clean Money movement is taking hold in state after state. Overwhelming majorities in polls taken on this issue support a Clean Money system, where candidates raise a large number of very small contributions to qualify for a limited public grant to run an adequate, but not an extravagant, campaign. These polls, and the successful ballot initiatives in Maine, Massachusetts, and Arizona show that the public is not only ready, but eager, for a new way of financing our elections. 
   Obviously, Mr. President, a majority in the United States Senate is not yet ready for such a clean break with the current system. But I believe that over time we in the Senate will catch up with public sentiment, and this is the way we will have to go. I am convinced that Clean Money is the future of campaign financing in this country, at both the state and federal level. And so I am very pleased that Senators KERRY and WELLSTONE have decided to reintroduce their bill and I thank them for their leadership.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from Vermont [Senator LEAHY] to offer this resolution to encourage a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. We are introducing this resolution because of serious obstacles that have appeared en route to a ballot to determine the future status of East Timor. 
   Earlier this year it appeared that there was finally some progress in East Timor. President Habibie announced on January 27 that the government of Indonesia was finally willing to seek to learn and respect the wishes of the people in that territory. There appears to be an agreement between the governments of Indonesia and Portugal to hold a vote, currently scheduled for August 8, to determine East Timor's future political status. This latter accord is expected to be finalized today at the United Nations. 
   Despite this positive development, excitement and tension over the possibility of gaining independence have in recent months led to an incredible level of violence and intimidation. The situation on the ground continues to worsen as East Timor has been wracked by violence throughout the last several weeks. Militias, comprised of individuals determined to intimidate the East Timorese people into support for continued integration with Indonesia and widely believed to be supported by the Indonesian military, are responsible for a sharp increase in violence. 
   Let me recount some of the horror stories I have heard coming out of East Timor in the last few weeks. To cite just a few examples, pro-government militias, backed by Indonesian troops, reportedly shot and killed 17 supporters of independence on April 5. Shortly thereafter, pro-independence groups reported clashes, arrests and deaths, as well as civilians fleeing violence in six cities. One of those cities was Liquica where at least 25 people were brutally murdered by pro-government militias when up to 2000 civilians sought shelter in the local Catholic church. Later, on April 17, hundreds of East Timorese fled the capital of Dili as knife-wielding militias attacked anyone suspected of supporting independence. At least 30 were killed in this incident as Indonesian troops made little effort to stop the violence. The perpetrators have not all been on the government side. Over the years there have been atrocities on the pro-independence side as well. In recent months, however, the overwhelming majority of the violence has come from army elements and militias under their effective control. Overall, hundreds of civilians have been killed, wounded or disappeared in separate militia attacks.  
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, there is no sign that the tension will ease between now and the August ballot. Pro-integration militia leaders announced on April 29 that they reject the concept of the upcoming ballot, or anything that could be considered a referendum. They have further stated that if a ballot leads to independence, they are prepared to fight a guerrilla war for decades if necessary to defend Indonesian rule of the territory. Independent observers fear that neither side will accept a loss in the August 8 ballot, thus setting the stage for a prolonged conflict in East Timor. This type of rhetoric does not reassure us about the prospects for a successful transition for the people of East Timor, regardless of which form of government they choose. The climate in East Timor today, sadly, may have become too violent for a legitimate poll to take place. Worse yet, the agreement on the ballot process that we hope will be announced today in New York will be rendered meaningless if people will fear for their lives if they dare to participate in the process. 
   The government of Indonesia must shoulder particular responsibility. Whether Indonesian troops have actually participated in these types of incidents or not, the authorities certainly must accept the blame for allowing, and in some cases, encouraging the bloody tactics of the pro-integration militias. As a long time observer of the situation there, I see the continuation of this violence as a threat to the very sanctity and legitimacy of the process that is underway. It is for this reason that Senator LEAHY and I have submitted our resolution to encourage the government in Jakarta to do all it can to seek a peaceful process and a fair resolution to the situation in East Timor. 
   Mr President, I believe the United States has a responsibility, an obligation, to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian government to help encourage an environment conducive to a free, fair, peaceful ballot process for the people of East Timor. Administration officials are saying the right things, but perhaps have not fully used the leverage we have at our disposal to make things happen. If we are ever going to resolve this issue, now is the time for us, the whole U.S. government, to act decisively. 
   In order to further bring pressure on the government of Indonesia to ensure the conditions necessary for the ballot on a settlement for East Timor, the Leahy/Feingold resolution would link the transfer of defense articles and services to effective measures by the Indonesian government and military to ensure a stable environment in East Timor. 
   Though non-binding, it is strongly worded. Specifically, our resolution recognizes progress in negotiations on a settlement proposal for East Timor, and the Indonesian government's apparent willingness to seek a peaceful resolution to the status of East Timor, but highlights the resultant increase in violence and human rights abuses by anti-independence militias and urges the Habibie government to curtail Indonesian military support to the militias. Nevertheless, despite that progress and the prospect of today's finalization of ballot procedures, access to East Timor by international monitors remains restricted, threatening the very environment needed to conduct a free and fair ballot 
   Most importantly, our resolution makes positive recommendations about what the United States can do to create an environment conducive to a free election. It states that it is the Sense of the Senate that we should urge the U.S. government to contribute to the United Nations Trust Fund to provide support for the East Timor ballot process. It also encourages the Administration to urge the Indonesian government to disarm the militias and grant full access to East Timor by international monitors. 
   Mr. President, it is not in our power to guarantee the free, fair exercise of the rights of the people of East Timor to determine their future. It is, however, in our interest to do all that we can to work with the United Nations, other concerned countries, the government of Indonesia and the people of East Timor to create an opportunity for a successful ballot process. We cannot forget that the Timorese have been living with violence and oppression for more than 23 years. These many years have not dulled the desire of the East Timorese for freedom, or quieted their demands to have a role in the determination of East Timor's status. We have to do all we can to support an environment that can produce a fair ballot in East Timor. Now. And throughout the rest of this process.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a heavy heart. If it hadn't happened already, the Yugoslav conflict just hit home. 
   Early yesterday morning, NATO experienced its first fatalities in its campaign against Yugoslavia. And Chetek, Wisconsin found its way into the news. 
   Army Chief Warrant Officer Kevin L. Reichert, of Chetek, Wisconsin, was killed aboard an Apache helicopter during a nighttime training mission in Albania. My thoughts, prayers, and sympathies go out to the friends and family of Kevin Reichert. We can all be proud of Kevin's service to his country. 
   The 28-year old from Wisconsin's Chippewa Valley leaves behind his wife of eight years, Ridgeley, and 3 kids. I thank the proud residents of Chetek and of Barron County, Wisconsin, for helping to raise such a brave and dedicated American. I hope the Reichert family and the 1,700 people of Chetek will take solace in the gratitude of our Nation. 
   The NATO effort in Yugoslavia has its costs. Kevin's death, and that of his co-pilot, David Gibbs, of Ohio, are sad reminders that conflicts like the one in Yugoslavia, while they seem far away, have a very real impact at home. 
   Mr. President, I am sure my colleagues join me in paying tribute to Kevin Reichert for his dedicated service to the United States.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. On April 28th, Madison lost a dedicated advocate and a dear friend: Betty Franklin-Hammonds. 
   Betty's life story is a catalogue of remarkable achievements. From her tenure as the executive director of the Madison Urban League, where she spearheaded a study on the gap in achievement between black and white students in the Madison school system, to her leadership at the Madison Times and the numerous awards she received for her work, there are countless examples of Betty's effectiveness as an advocate in the community. 
   But it was her character, more than any title or award, that defined Betty and made her such a powerful presence in our community. She was a truth teller who never backed down from a fight, a woman who led by example and wasn't shy about asking others to make the commitment to change she demanded from herself. 
   Betty was a unique combination of a quiet dignity and a fierce passion for justice that could only be quenched by constant motion. She worked tirelessly, as a social worker, at the Madison chapter of the NAACP, at the Urban League, and at the Madison Times, to make our city a better place. 
   Her own words tell us more about Betty than any tribute ever could. After receiving an award for her humanitarian work, she once told a crowd that ``everybody can be great because everybody can serve.'' By that measure, Betty Franklin-Hammonds was great indeed.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank my good friend from Arizona. 
   Mr. President, let me first express my feelings and those of the Senate and every American that we are so pleased that the three soldiers are freed from their captivity in Yugoslavia. But I do reiterate what the administration and others have said. Mr. Milosevic and his cohorts should get absolutely no benefit out of those incidents that led to the capture and then the release of these soldiers. 
   I hope no step we take or no comments we make today or at any point in the next few days suggest in any way that Mr. Milosevic deserves any kind of reward for undoing something that should not have been done in the first place. We are terribly pleased that the soldiers are free. That does not change what Mr. Milosevic has done, which is unforgivable. 
   I, of course, praise the main authors of this resolution, my friend from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, and another good friend, Senator HAGEL from Nebraska. These are two of the best people to work with in this entire body. I know that their goal and the goal of the other cosponsors is a very worthy one, an important one, and that is to bring clarity with regard to our policy and our military action concerning Kosovo. 
   I rise today to make what I believe are two important points regarding S.J. Res. 20, the McCain-Biden resolution authorizing the use of force in the current conflict in Yugoslavia. 
   First, on the one hand, I oppose this resolution because I cannot at this point wholly endorse the current means being employed by the President to carry out a still murky policy with regard to Kosovo, and I cannot, in light of that, expand the authority of the President through congressional action beyond our current vision and information and understanding, even of the facts today, let alone what the facts  may be tomorrow or in a couple of weeks. This is why I cannot support the resolution today. 
   On the other hand--and I think this is very important as well--I believe it is very important that the Senate debate this resolution now, as we are doing, because whatever our divergent views on the current crisis may be, we in Congress share a common set of duties under the Constitution and under the War Powers Resolution to do what we are attempting to do this afternoon. I begin by talking a little bit about the process. 
   Our minds are primarily on the current intervention and involvement, and that is appropriate. We also have to take a moment at a time like this to realize how this fits into the overall context of the role of Congress, the role of the Senate, with regard to the waging of war. 
   In certain respects, the process so far has established, or at least reiterated, important precedents. In some other ways, I regret that the Senate has at least partially ducked its weighty responsibilities in this regard. There are precedents being set by the consideration of S.J. Res. 20. 
   Although it was apparently not the intent of the sponsors, S.J. Res. 20 has been determined to be privileged under the terms of section 6 of the War Powers Resolution. That is an important moment, because sometimes Presidents and others have attempted to not take the War Powers Resolution seriously. Not only must it be taken seriously, but because of the appropriate ruling of the Parliamentarian with regard to the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, it is being taken seriously. 
   I would like to make note of the Parliamentarian's comments at Friday's meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I serve. Even Chairman HELMS thought it was legally important enough to have the Parliamentarian's opinion be made part of the record of that meeting, and I thought it was as well.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. 
   Let me just read to the Senate one sentence. The memo is dated April 30.  
   The War Powers Resolution.......controls the consideration of any such joint resolution.  
   He was referring to the specific language of and the date of introduction of the joint resolution that is before us. 
   Mr. President, that is important in terms of the history of the War Powers Resolution. 
   So while this resolution does not actually make a specific reference to the War Powers Resolution, the very fact that it triggered the provisions of this law demonstrates the vitality--the vitality--of the War Powers Resolution to a degree that I think is often forgotten or ignored when we are between crises of this kind. 
   The determination by the Parliamentarian leaves no doubt that the debate the Senate is engaged in today is an explicit and required exercise in war powers under the law of this country. 
   I am pleased about that. But I do have a few concerns about other aspects of the process that we have undertaken. 
   First, I am concerned about the President's action. I remain concerned that although the President did send a letter to the Congress acknowledging that hostilities had broken out, he did not submit the report required under section 4(a) of the War Powers Resolution. 
   Now, nonetheless, as the Parliamentarian has ruled, the language of the resolution still triggered the War Powers Resolution on its own. But I believe it required, in a situation like this, the President to 
   specifically refer to the War Powers Resolution. As a number of people have said, obviously, we are at war, or certainly we are in a situation that involves hostilities or imminent hostilities insofar as the War Powers Resolution applies. 
   Second, I am concerned about the way the Senate has handled this matter. The resolution, of course, has been hurriedly considered. That is in part because I do not think the authors intended, and many people did not realize for a while, that the War Powers Resolution and its clock were ticking. So it was understandable that there had to be some hurry. But there was enough time, in my view, for a more thorough consideration of this matter before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   A business meeting on this was hastily scheduled. There really was no time to consider the matter except for a brief hour, hour and a half discussion. There was not really a proper markup. We did not have a chance to offer any amendments or modifications to the language of the resolution, which the distinguished chairman himself properly called one of the most important matters that had ever been taken up by the committee in his tenure on the committee--which is a lengthy tenure. And then, after all of that, the committee reported out the resolution without recommendation, without taking a stand for or against the resolution. Then, finally, it was reported out to the full Senate without a written report. 
   I do not understand what the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is for if it is not the committee which would take a real look at and amend and mark up and consider, in some detail, a matter of this importance. Again, given the tremendous courtesy and skill of the members of the committee, this is not said out of any disrespect. We were put in a very difficult time constraint, but it seems somehow we should have had a process that was more in keeping with the importance of the resolution and its role within the War Powers Resolution law. 
   Mr. President, I also was concerned last week that some Members were discussing propounding a unanimous consent agreement that threatened to weaken the force of the War Powers Resolution, or at least I was concerned about the fact that it might do that, by making it easier to eliminate the privileged status of future Senate actions related to war powers. 
   I want it noted in the record that the proposed unanimous consent agreement did not prevail. It was apparently not even propounded because of concerns. And I am pleased, because I do not think we should take it upon ourselves to make exceptions or weaken the importance and binding character of the War Powers Resolution. That has been attempted far too many times in the past. 
   We need this law that was passed to give some real content and meaning to the constitutional role of Congress under article I and throughout the Constitution with regard to the conduct of war or hostilities by the United States of America. 
   Mr. President, I also want to agree with some comments I at least read by the Senator from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, who, of course, is doing a very, very brave job of leading this whole issue. He did comment that this problem--and correct me if I am wrong, Senator--that this is not really a long enough debate for a matter of this importance. Four hours, split between the two sides, 2 hours each, is not in keeping with the magnitude of this situation or the magnitude of this resolution. 
   In fact, although I am certainly sometimes guilty of not always being out here on the Senate floor, the fact that I have 
   only seen five or six Senators on the floor for what is soon to be over half of the entire debate on this matter does not remind me of the effort and the care and the listening that went into a similar debate when it came to the Iraq intervention some 8 years ago. 
   So the debate surely should be longer. And as Senators start arriving and hope to find time to speak before 5:30, I think there may be some frustration. In any event, we certainly should all be listening to each other when it comes to a matter of this importance, as much as we were during the impeachment trial. 
   Mr. President, finally, I also am a little troubled about the idea of the tabling of this resolution. A motion to table can be interpreted--often is interpreted--as a procedural vote. On something this important, we should be voting on the merits of the language. I do not understand why at 5:30 tonight we are not going to just vote up or down on this resolution.  
   A tabling motion seems, to me, to be not in keeping with the significance of this. Mr. President, as I have indicated, in the past the War Powers Resolution has sometimes been ignored, but sometimes we have come very close to getting it right. 
   Two examples where we came close were the Lebanon intervention and the 1990-1991 Iraqi situation. In the Lebanon case, Congress actually authorized continued participation of Marines in the multinational peacekeeping force. Although the 18-month duration of the authorization represented a compromise to get the administration to agree to it, the congressional authorization represented the first time since the War Powers Resolution had become law where Congress obtained a signature by the President on legislation that actually invoked the War Powers Resolution, and also, as I just alluded to a moment ago, with regard to Iraq and the Persian Gulf. 
   In the case of that war, President Bush actually requested congressional support, which ended up being granted. There was a problem in that case. That request, of course, came significantly after President Bush had already deployed thousands of troops to the area, but at least the President of the United States, in that situation, explicitly acknowledged the applicability of the law in that case. 
   So despite my concerns--that I did think were important to put in the record for future reference in situations like this--in the end, consideration of this resolution remains an appropriate exercise of the Senate's responsibilities under the War Powers Resolution. We have begun to do our duty, and the vitality of the War Powers Resolution has again been affirmed and respected. 
   President, as I said, although I would have preferred to vote up or down on the merits of the Senate joint resolution, I will support the motion to table this resolution because I do not support the scope of the resolution and I have real doubts about the policy which it seeks to endorse. Especially given the breadth of the authority that is given under the resolution I am concerned. But I have concerns about the policy in Kosovo in any event. 
   First, Mr. President, I do not understand how this decision to intervene in Kosovo and to continue and broaden the intervention really fits in with an overall post-cold war American foreign policy strategy. I do not see how this fits in with our long-term goals. 
   Obviously, the tragedies and the horrors that are being perpetrated in Kosovo demand a response. That response must include the United States. But I do not think the question has been well answered why in Kosovo and not in other places. I give the Senator from Nebraska credit for just attempting to address the issue. He spoke a little bit about his belief that it would be difficult for us to act in some of the places in Africa and other places where there are similar tragedies. I am not sure I agree with that. We are not limited in our ability to act only in Europe or only near our own boundaries, especially in light of the actions that were taken with regard to the Middle East and Iraq. We have shown our ability to act throughout the world. The fact is, in my mind we could have acted in Rwanda. In fact, we apologized to Rwanda for having not taken the action that we could have taken to stop the genocide in that place. 
   In Rwanda, in Sierra Leone, in East Timor, in Sudan, there are atrocities that are comparable, in some cases arguably worse, if that is possible, than what is going on in Kosovo. Why is it that--it at least appears to some--an accident of geography is sufficient to allow inaction while Kosovo requires a huge commitment? This question needs to be answered not so much for me but for the American people, because they do not understand, and I do not understand exactly why one tragedy demands our attention and our action and another one simply does not, especially when it comes to the use of significant military force. 
   Another concern, the Senator from Nebraska was suggesting, in effect, is that we must take a stand. He is right, but he assumes this is the only option when he says we must support this resolution. Otherwise, he seems to say, we would have to be accused of taking no action, or we would be accused of being unconcerned or not moved by what is happening in Kosovo. 
   I am not sure all the other options have truly been explored. What about the possibility of arming the Albanian Kosovars so they have a better and legitimate chance at their own self-defense? The Secretary of State said to me at a hearing recently that they wouldn't be able to do much with the arms anyway. I question that. I bet the Kosovar Albanians 
   would question that. I even remember a briefing the other day by some of the NATO officials indicating that resistance from some of the Kosovar Albanians had had a negative impact on the Serbian troops. This is something that we should encourage rather than simply allow people to be herded around and tortured. They have a right to self-defense like anyone else. 
   What about support for democratic elements in Serbia, as has been suggested by some of our colleagues in the recently introduced Serbian Democracy Act? Are there further diplomatic efforts that could be taken? What about the United Nations? Have we fully explored all of the options available working with Russia? 
   It is not so clear to me that the only way to proceed is to give a broad, open-ended blank check to the President with regard to this situation. I don't think it is the only option. 
   I am also concerned how this fits in with our overall policy just with respect to the Balkans. I am amazed at how infrequently in this debate people even refer to the fact that we are still stuck in the Bosnia intervention. We were promised at the time of the Bosnia intervention that it would be 1 year, that the troops would be home by December 1996, that it would cost no more than $2 billion. But here we are, in 1999, it has cost, I am told, over $9 billion. We no longer even hear any talk about when the troops will come home. It is Christmas after Christmas after Christmas after the time when all of our troops were supposed to be out of Bosnia. 
   How does this policy in Kosovo connect with the policy in Bosnia? What is the strategy for getting in and for getting out? Sometimes I believe with respect to what we are doing in Bosnia, the administration's policy is sort of a ``less said the better'' attitude. If you don't mention it, nobody is going to remind you that we have been there for an awfully long time and have not been able to get out. 
   I am also concerned, and I say this carefully, about what I consider to be a somewhat inconsistent application of international law by the administration with regard to this action. Again, I have no sympathy for Mr. Milosevic and his regime. But the fact is, our country recognizes Kosovo as being part of Yugoslavia, and yet we proceed with this action without a real explanation of how this comports with the rules of international law. I can tell you, most experts in international don't have a good explanation of how we can go about doing this. 
   It would be one thing if we were talking about recognizing an independent Kosovo, but we have not taken that position. I asked the Secretary of State the other day whether that might be in the offing, and she indicated that was not a likely scenario. In the same conversation, I asked her, what about lifting the arms embargo on the Albanian Kosovars? She said we couldn't do that because of international law. Well, this is sort of a cavalier attitude, where we rely on international law as an excuse to not do something we should do in one case, the case of lifting the arms embargo, but we disregard international law or suggest that it is a technicality when it comes to the idea of not recognizing an area separate from Serbia and then going ahead and proceeding to take military action with what our own policy apparently regards as, in effect, a province of Serbia. This troubles me.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to make just a couple other points regarding my concern about supporting this resolution with respect to the substance of it, with respect to the intervention itself. 
   This is almost a cliche--almost every Member of the Congress has said it--but it is still correct; that is, that our strategy is unclear. I don't believe the administration has fully articulated the policy which the airstrikes were intended to support. 
   I did oppose the airstrikes. I recognize the Senate voted for them. But I didn't see the policy at the time. The goals need to be explained more fully and a better case needs to be made for our continued military involvement. Certainly, if we are going to pass a resolution of this scope, we need a far clearer understanding. I don't think the President has adequately explained the national interest and objectives and cost estimates and exit strategy in this situation. 
   Finally, with regard to concerns in terms of whether this is a course we should follow, I have to share the view of the Senator from Arkansas, who indicated that this argument, that maybe we made a mistake in the first place but we have to finish it now that we are there, is really a terrible argument. It is a dangerous situation--we have been there before--to suggest that simply because we have gotten into a situation that we have to go full bore into it without really being sure of how far it will go or what the ultimate consequences would be. The mere fact that we started it does not mean we have to take every possible step in pursuit of a policy that had flaws from the beginning. 
   In any event, after having listed five or six concerns about the substance of this intervention, let me conclude by making just a couple of comments about the fact that the resolution itself is too broad, even if it did support what we are doing exactly in Kosovo at this time. I am pleased the Senate is considering a resolution that would authorize the use of military force, but the resolution before us today does not define parameters of what that military involvement would be. The phrase ``blank check'' is appropriate. That is what this resolution provides. I think it would be irresponsible, very similar to what happened with regard to the Gulf of Tonkin in the Vietnam situation, if we go down this road. 
   As we think about taking this very extensive measure, let us remember that there is a lack of consensus among the American people and the Congress about the policy to pursue with regard to Kosovo. Even under the current facts and circumstances that the American people know and that we know, this resolution is too broad. But given its breadth and the implications, we have no idea what the position will be in a few weeks, and this resolution gives a blank check. 
   We do have to take a stand. This Senate did take a stand in favor of the bombing a few weeks ago, even though I voted no. But the fact is, only this body supported the airstrikes. Last week the other body, on a tie vote, 213 to 213, voted not to support the airstrikes, after having watched the impact and the effects of the airstrikes for the last month. So there is no joint resolution by this Congress at any point in support of even the airstrikes. There is no resolution of the kind that went through the House and the Senate in the Iraq intervention. Yes, that was a close vote in the Senate with regard to Iraq, but the difference is, both Houses sent that up to the President as a reflection of the will of Congress. 
   I share some of the concerns with regard to some of the votes in the other body. I do recognize that it is very hard to understand how some people can vote not to go forward with this action and then in the next minute vote to put additional funding in for the action. That is very confusing as well. 
   What I am afraid it reflects is that there is no consensus in the Congress or in the country with regard to what we have already done in Kosovo, let alone a consensus that would justify the sweeping language that we find before us today. 
   Let me conclude by saying that I will vote to table the resolution because we should not rush into further steps in this matter, including deployment of forces, without a consensus in Congress, without a plan from the administration, and without some sense of how this decision to intervene in this tragedy fits into the broader question of what our foreign policy should be in the post-cold-war era, when we are confronted with human tragedy around the world. 
   Let me finally say that I thank the sponsors because they have triggered events that have allowed us today to exercise our roles to reaffirm the vitality and continuing need for the War  Powers Resolution and the obligations of Congress and the President to comply with them. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to join the Senator from Minnesota, Senator GRAMS, in introducing a measure to repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact was included in the 1996 farm bill during conference negotiations after it had been struck from the Senate version of the farm bill during floor consideration. 
   Mr. President, support of this legislation is especially crucial as compact proponents have recently introduced a measure to make permanent and expand the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and establish a southern dairy compact. In other words, a measure devised to control three percent of the country's milk is now seeking 40% of the country's milk. The cost to consumers, taxpayers, and farmers outside the compact region are enormous. 
   Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact bill of 1996 established a commission for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut--empowered to set minimum prices for fluid milk above those established under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. This sort or compact was unprecedented and unnecessary because the Federal milk marketing order system already provided farmers in the designated compact region with minimum milk prices higher than those received by most other dairy farmers throughout the nation. But they wanted more. 
   This compact not only allows the six States to set artificially high fluid milk prices for their producers, it also allows those States to keep out lower priced milk from producers in competing States and provides processors within the region with a subsidy to export their higher priced milk to noncompact States. 
   Mr. President, the arguments against this type of price-fixing scheme are numerous: It interferes with interstate commerce by erecting barriers around one region of the Nation; It provides preferential price treatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers nationally and may now extend that privilege to the south; It encourages excess milk production in one region without establishing effective supply control that drives down milk prices for producers throughout the country; It imposes higher costs on the  millions of consumers in the Compact region; It imposes higher costs to taxpayers who pay for nutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school lunch programs which provide milk and other dairy products and as a price-fixing mechanism, the compact it is unprecedented in the history of this Nation. 
   Most important to my home State of Wisconsin, Mr. President, is that the Northeast Dairy Compact exacerbates the inequities within the Federal milk marketing orders system that already discriminates against dairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the upper Midwest. Federal orders provide higher fluid milk prices to producers the further they are located from Eau Claire, WI, for markets east of the Rocky Mountains. 
   Wisconsin farmers have complained for many years that this inherently discriminatory system provides other regions, such as the Northeast, the Southeast, and the Southwest with milk prices that encourage excess production in those regions. Of course, that excess production drives down prices throughout the Nation and results in excessive production of cheese, butter, and dry milk. 
   Cheese and other manufactured dairy products constitute the pillar of our dairy industry in Wisconsin. Competition for the production and sale of these products by other regions spurred on by artificial incentives under milk marketing orders has eroded our markets for cheese and other products. 
   Mr. President, my State of Wisconsin loses more dairy farms each year than any other state. A recent survey by the National Milk Producers Federation revealed that, between 1993 and 1998, Wisconsin lost over 7000 dairy farms--that's three dairy farms a day! The number of manufacturing plants has declined from 400 in 1985 to less than 230 in 1996. These losses are due in part, to the systematic discrimination and market distortions created by Federal dairy policies that provide artificial regional advantages that cannot be justified on any rational economic grounds. 
   Lets look at their arguments: They claim this legislation is necessary to save their small dairy farmers, yet the bill does not target small operations. One year after the compact began, New England dairy farms went out of business at a 41% faster rate than in the prior two years. 
   They also claim that consumers in their regions are willing to pay a higher price at the grocery store as a result of the compact. However, studies show that higher milk prices at the retail level result in a decline in milk consumption at home. According to economists, a 10% increase in price can lead to as much as an 8% decline in consumption. The spread of dairy compacts to include half of the U.S. population in the Northeast, the South and parts of the Midwest could drive up milk prices as much as 20%. 
   Mr. President, my colleague from Minnesota, Senator GRAMS and I are on the floor today offering this legislation because the Northeast Dairy Compact reinforces the outrageous discrimination that has so wounded the dairy industry in our States. We have 
   fought to change Federal milk marketing orders and we will fight to prevent the Northeast Dairy Compact from becoming permanent and expanding, and prevent the authorization of a southern compact. We will do all of these things in the name of basic fairness, simple justice and economic sanity in the marketplace. Upper Midwest dairy farmers have been bled long enough. 
   When prices fall, as they have recently, all farmers feel the stress. Why should one farmer in a region arbitrarily suffer or benefit more than another farmer on a similar operation in another region because of this artificial finger on the scale called the compact. Regional inequities are the inherent assumption of compact proponents and a basic economic premise of the compact idea. Shouldn't we be working together to make conditions better for all dairy producers? Why should one region, and now multiple regions be treated differently? 
   And yet the Northeast Compact provides price protection for dairy farmers in six States, insulating them from market conditions which ordinary noncompact farmers have to live with. Compact proponents have never been able to explain how conditions in the Northeast merit greater protection from market price fluctuations than other regions of the country. The fact that there are no compelling arguments made in favor of the compact that justified special treatment for the Northeast was emphasized by a vote in the full Senate to strike the compact from the 1996 farm bill. It was the only recorded vote on approval or disapproval of the Northeast Dairy Compact--and it killed the compact in the Senate. The way in which the compact was ultimately included in the 1996 farm bill also illustrates the weak justification for its approval. Let me remind my colleagues that the compact was never included in the House version of the farm bill and yet emerged as part of the bill after a closed door Conference negotiation. Legislation which is patently unfair and difficult to defend must frequently be negotiated behind closed doors rather than in the light of day. 
   Even the Secretary of Agriculture, after approving the compact, was unable to come up with an economic justification for the compact. The Secretary's finding of `compelling public interest' as a basis for justifying his approval of the compact was so weak and unsupported by the public record that a suit was filed by compact opponents in Federal court charging that the Secretary violated the Administrative Procedures Act. 
   Mr. President, authorizing dairy compacts is bad public policy because it increases costs to taxpayers and consumers and currently only benefits a few in privileged regions. It is bad dairy policy because it exacerbates regional discrimination of existing Federal milk marketing orders by providing artificial advantages to a small group of producers at the expense of all others. And it is bad economic policy because it establishes barriers to interstate trade--barriers of the type the United States has been working hard to eliminate in international markets. 
   Mr. President, Congress should never have provided Secretary Glickman with authority to approve the compact. That in my view, was an improper and potentially unconstitutional delegation of our authority and it was irresponsible. It is the role of Congress to approve interstate compacts and we irresponsibly abrogated our responsibility in this matter. It is time to make it right. 
   It is incumbent upon Congress to undo the mistake it made in the 1996 farm bill. It's time to repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy compact. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Dairy Reform Act of 1999, introduced by my colleague from Minnesota, Senator ROD GRAMS. 
   The Federal Dairy Program was developed in the 1930's, when the Upper Midwest was seen as the primary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to encourage the development of local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that had not produced enough to meet local needs. Six decades ago, the poor condition of the American transportation infrastructure and the lack of portable refrigeration technology prevented Upper Midwest producers from shipping fresh fluid milk to other parts of the country. Therefore, the only way to ensure consumers a fresh local supply of fluid milk was to provide dairy farmers in those distant regions with a boost in milk price large enough to encourage local production--that higher price referred to as the Class I differential. Mr. President, the system worked well--too well. Wisconsin is no longer this country's largest milk producer. This program has outlived its necessity and is now working only to shortchange the Upper Midwest, and in particular, Wisconsin dairy farmers. 
   The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 is very simple. It establishes that the minimum Class I price differential will be the same, $1.80/hundredweight, for each marketing order. As many of you know, the price for fluid milk increases at a rate of approximately 21 cents per 100 miles from Eau Claire, WI. Fluid milk prices, as a result, are nearly $3 higher in Florida than in Wisconsin, more than $2 higher in New England, and more than $1 higher in Texas. This bill ensures that the Class I differentials will no longer vary according to an arbitrary geographic measure--like the distance from Eau Claire Wisconsin. No longer will the system penalize producers in the Upper Midwest with an archaic program that outlived its purpose years ago. This legislation identifies one of the most unfair and unjustly punitive provisions in the current system, and corrects it. There is no substantive, equitable justification to support non-uniform Class I differentials in present day policy. 
   USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Order reform proposal was recently published. Although the USDA was successful in narrowing Class I differentials, discrepancies still exist. It is long past the time to set aside regional bickering and address the problems faced by dairy producers in all regions. The Dairy Reform Act of 1999 will make a change to USDA's proposed rule which will make the entire package more palatable for Wisconsin's producers. It will take USDA's proposal a step further and lead the dairy industry into a more market oriented program. Also producers will still be able to receive payment for transportation costs and over-order premiums.  This measure would finally bring fairness to an unfair system. With this bill we will send a clear message to USDA and to Congress that Upper-Midwest dairy farmers will never stop fighting this patently unfair federal milk marketing order system. After over 60 years of struggling under this burden of inequality, Wisconsin's dairy industry deserves more; it deserves a fair price.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women in our labor force that put their health and safety on the line every day at work. Today, we observe the passage of the landmark Occupational Safety and Health Act, signed into law 29 years ago, and the tenth anniversary of Workers' Memorial Day. 
   Mr. President, today is a chance for all of us to celebrate, and to mourn--to recognize the strides we've made on worker safety, and to mourn those who have lost their lives while they were simply doing their job. 
   Although the workplace death rate has been cut in half since 1970, 60,000 workers still die every year from job hazards, and six million more are injured. In Wisconsin our workplace accidents rate of 11.4 workplace accidents per 100 workers is higher than the national average. This is not a statistic anyone should be proud of, but it does help us maintain our focus as we work toward stronger laws, stricter enforcement, and safer workplaces. 
   We need to work together to protect the workers that have built our communities and helped them thrive. Unfortunately we still hear stories of workers like Vernon Langholff, who in 1993 fell 100 feet to his death when a corroded fire escape collapsed beneath him while he was cleaning dust from a grain bin. Just this year a company in Jefferson County was convicted in a state court for the recklessness that caused Langholff's death. In 1996 the company was fined $450,000 for its deliberate indifference to worker safety--because they delayed spending the $15,000 it would have taken to fix the fire escape and prevent Langholff's death. Stories like this remind us that an unsafe workplace can mean disaster for everyone involved--it can bring untold tragedy to a family, it can bring serious, long-term financial and legal repercussions for an employer. 
   The consequences of delaying the repair of a fire escape or ignoring safety  procedures can often be tragic, and they are always preventable. To prevent more tragedies on the job, we've got to make sure workers can join unions without employer interference or intimidation, we must help protect whistleblowers who call attention to dangerous working conditions, and above all we've got to fight back against attempts in Congress to weaken OSHA laws. 
   I do not understand the yearly assault on worker safety in Congress. Again this year, the Safety Advancement for Employees Act, or SAFE Act has been introduced. This legislation takes away a worker's right to an on-site inspection to investigate a hazard, or permitting OSHA to issue warnings instead of citations. This bill isn't OSHA re-form, it's OSHA de-form. This bill would more appropriately be named the ``UNSAFE'' act. 
   Mr. President, I will work with my colleagues to fight back any attempt to weaken the protection of Wisconsin's workers. It's time to move the workplace forward to the 21st Century, not back to the dark ages. 
   I am proud to stand with this country's workers in the fight for the dignity, respect and safe workplace they deserve. I urge my colleagues to join me in this important and worthy battle. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to legislation introduced today by my colleagues Senator JEFFORDS, Senator LEAHY, Senator COCHRAN and Senator SPECTER. They have introduced a measure which will further aggravate the inequities of the Federal Milk Marketing Order system. Their legislation will make permanent and expand the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact and will authorize the establishment of a southern dairy compact. 
   Despite the discrimination against dairy farmers in Wisconsin under the Federal Dairy policy known as the Eau Claire rule, the 1996 Farm Bill provided the final nail in the coffin when it created and authorized for 3-years, the existence of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact sounded benign in 1996, but its effect has been anything but, magnifying the existing inequities of the system. 
   The bill which authorized the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact established a commission for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. This commission set minimum prices for fluid milk higher even than those established under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. Never mind that the Federal milk marketing order system, under the Eau Claire rule, already provided farmers in the region with minimum prices higher than those received by most other dairy farmers throughout the nation. 
   The compact, which controlled three percent of the country's milk, not only  allowed the six States to set artificially high prices for their producers, it allowed them to block entry of lower priced milk from producers in competing States. To give them an even bigger advantage, processors in the region get a subsidy to export their higher priced milk to noncompact States. It's a windfall for Northeast dairy farmers. It's also plainly unfair and unjust to the rest of the country. 
   Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact (NEIDC) is set to expire at the implementation of USDA's new Federal Milk Market Order system. According to the Omnibus Appropriations measure passed last year, the expiration date of the NEIDC is scheduled for October 1, 1999. Now, Members of Congress are pushing for an extension and expansion of the existing milk cartel and for the authorization of another. 
   To make clear the magnitude of this legislation on producers and consumers we need to only look at the numbers. Currently, three percent of milk is under a compact, conceivably, under this new measure, over 40% of this country's milk will be affected. More importantly, one hundred percent of this country's milk prices will be affected--in Wisconsin, prices will be adversely affected. 
   These compacts amount to nothing short of government-sponsored price fixing. They are unfair, and bad policy. Now, my colleagues would like you to make this compact permanent, expand it to include other states, and authorize a southern dairy compact. After three years, we know that dairy compacts: 
   Blatantly interfere with interstate commerce and wildly distort the marketplace by erecting artificial barriers around one specially protected region of the Nation; 
   Arbitrarily provide preferential price treatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers in other regions who work just as hard, who love their homes just as much and whose products are just as good--maybe better in Wisconsin; 
   Irresponsibly encourage excess milk production in one region without establishing effective supply control. This practice flaunts basic economic principles and ignores the obvious risk that it will drive down milk prices for producers everywhere else in the country; 
   Raises retail milk prices on the millions of consumers in the Compact region; 
   Imposes higher costs on every taxpayer because we all pay for nutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school lunch programs that provide milk and other dairy products. 
   As a price-fixing device, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was unprecedented in the history of this Nation. As a dairy cartel, it is a poor legislative fix and bad precedent to deal with low milk prices. 
   Wisconsin's dairy farmers are being economically crippled by federal dairy policies. It's time to bring justice to federal dairy policy, and give Wisconsin Dairy farmers a fair shot in the market place. 
   I urge my colleagues not to buy into the rhetoric surrounding this issue. I urge you to work together towards fair national dairy policy. A policy that provides all dairy producers a fair price for their commodity, a policy that allows all of this country's dairy producers to succeed on the basis of hard work and a good product. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and to join me in the fight against its passage.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an original cosponsor of the Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act of 1999. I commend the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. WELLSTONE] and our colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman VENTO, for their commitment to this important issue. 
   I honor the service of the Lao and Hmong veterans to the United States, and appreciate the great personal risk they faced when they chose to help this country. I am pleased that many of them have chosen to make the United States, and my home state of Wisconsin, their adopted homeland. 
   In my view, Mr. President, this bill, which would expedite the naturalization process for 45,000 Lao and Hmong veterans and their spouses, is the least we can for the help repay the huge debt we owe these brave individuals. I have had the opportunity to meet many Lao and Hmong veterans and their families as I travel throughout Wisconsin. I am struck by the profound importance they place on becoming citizens of the United States. This bill would help them reach that goal.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the 1.5 million ethnic Armenians that were systematically murdered at the hands of the Ottoman Empire from 1915-1923. The 84th anniversary of the beginning of this brutal annihilation was marked on April 24. 
   During this nine year period, another 250,000 ethnic Armenians were forced to flee their homes to escape the certain death that awaited them at the hands of a government-sanctioned force determined to extinguish their existence. A total of 1.75 million ethnic Armenians were either slaughtered or forced to flee, leaving fewer than 80,000 in what is present-day Turkey. 
   I have come to the floor to commemorate this horrific chapter in human history each year I have been a member of this body, both to honor those who died and to remind the American people of the chilling capacity for violence that, unfortunately, still exists in the world. It is all too clear from the current ethnically and religiously motivated conflicts in such  places as Kosovo, Sierra Leone, and Sudan that we have not learned the lessons of the past. 
   The ongoing campaign of violence and hate perpetrated by Slobodan Milosevic and his thugs against the Kosovar Albanians is but the latest example of the campaigns of terror carried out against innocent civilians simply because of who they are. These people are not combatants and they have committed no crimes--they are simply ethnic Albanians who wish to live in peace in their homes in Kosovo. But, because they are ethnic Albanians, they have been murdered or driven out, their possessions have been looted, and their homes have been burned. Many more are hiding in the mountains of Kosovo, caught in a dangerous limbo, afraid to try to flee across the border to safety and unable to go home. 
   On April 13, we marked Yom Hashoah, the annual remembrance of the 6 million Jews who were exterminated by Nazi Germany. People around the world gathered to light candles and read the names of those who died. Today, let us take a moment to remember the victims of the 1915-1923 Armenian genocide, and all the other innocent people who have died in the course of human history at the hands of people who hated them simply for who they were.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the Senator from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN) as an original co-sponsor of legislation to designate 9.1 million acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in Utah as wilderness. 
   Though this is the second time this particular measure has been introduced in this body, this year's legislation has been substantially revised. As the Senator from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN) has already described, these revisions have been made on the basis of a citizen-led re-inventory of the wilderness quality lands that remain on BLM lands in Utah. 
   During the April recess I had an opportunity to travel to Utah. I viewed firsthand some of the lands that would be designated for wilderness under Senator DURBIN's bill. I was able to view most of the proposed wilderness areas from the air, and was able to enhance my understanding through hikes outside of the Zion National Park on the Dry Creek Bench wilderness unit contained in this proposal, and inside the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to Upper Calf Creek Falls. 
   I support this legislation, for a few reasons, Mr. President, but most of all because I have personally seen what is at stake, and I know the marvelous resources that Wisconsinites and all Americans own in the BLM lands of Southern Utah. 
   Second, Mr. President, I support this legislation because I believe it sets the broadest and boldest mark for the lands that should be protected in Southern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers wilderness legislation it ought to know, as a benchmark, the full measure of those lands which are deserving of wilderness protection. This bill encompases all the BLM lands of wilderness quality in Utah. Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Senate has not, as we do today, always had the benefit of considering wilderness designations for all of the deserving lands in Southern Utah. During the 104th Congress, I joined with the former Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Bradley) in opposing that Congress' Omnibus Parks legislation. It contained provisions, which were eventually removed, that many in my home state of Wisconsin believed not only designated as wilderness too little of the Bureau of Land Management's holding in Utah deserving of such protection, but also substantively changed the protections afforded designated lands under the Wilderness Act of 1964. 
   The lands of Southern Utah are very special to the people of Wisconsin. In writing to me last Congress, my constituents described these lands as places of solitude, special family moments, and incredible beauty. In December 1997, Ron Raunikar of the Capital Times, a paper in Madison, WI, wrote:  
   Other remaining wilderness in the U.S. is at first daunting, but then endearing and always a treasure for all Americans. 
   The sensually sculpted slickrock of the Colorado Plateau and windswept crag lines of the Great Basin include some of the last of our country's wilderness which is not fully protected. 
   We must ask our elected officials to redress this circumstance, by enacting legislation which would protect those national lands within the boundaries of Utah. 
   This wilderness is a treasure we can lose only once or a legacy we can be forever proud to bestow to our children.  
   Some may say, Mr. President, that this legislation is unnecessary and Utah already has the ``monument'' that Wallace Stegner wrote about, designated by President Clinton on September 18, 1997. However, it is important to note, the land of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument comprises only about one tenth of the lands that will be granted wilderness protection under this bill. 
   I supported the President's actions to designate the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. On September 17, 1997, amid reports of the pending designation, I wrote a letter to President Clinton to support that action which was co-signed by six other members of the Senate. That letter concluded with the following statement ``We remain interested in working with the Administration on appropriate legislation to evaluate and protect the full extent of public lands in Utah that meet the criteria of the 1964 Wilderness Act.'' 
   I believe that the measure being introduced today will accomplish that goal. Identical in its designations to legislation sponsored in the other body by Rep. MAURICE HINCHEY of New York, it is the culmination of more than 15 years and four Congresses of effort in the other body beginning with the legislative work of the former Congressman from Utah (Mr. Owens). 
   The measure protects wild lands that really are not done justice by any description in words. In my trip I found widely varied and distinct terrain, remarkable American resources of red rock cliff walls, desert, canyons and gorges which encompass the canyon country of the Colorado Plateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great Basin. The lands also include mountain ranges in western Utah, and stark areas like the new National Monument. These regions appeal to all types of American outdoor interests from hikers and sightseers to hunters. 
   Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, answered an important question I am often asked when people want to know why a Senator from Wisconsin would  co-sponsor legislation to protect lands in Utah. He wrote on September 13, 1995 simply that ``These are not scenes that you could see in Wisconsin. That's part of what makes them special.'' He continues, and adds what I think is an even more important reason to act to protect these lands than the landscape's uniqueness, ``the fight over wilderness lands in Utah is a test case of sorts. The anti-environmental factions in Congress are trying hard to remove restrictions on development in some of the nation's most splendid areas.'' 
   Wisconsinites are watching this test case closely. I believe, Mr. President, that Wisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save Utah's lands as a sign of where the nation is headed with respect to its stewardship of natural resources. For example, some in my home state believe that among federal lands that comprise the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and the Nicolet and Chequamegon National Forests there are lands that are deserving of wilderness protection. These federal properties are incredibly important, and they mean a great deal to the people of Wisconsin. Wisconsinites want to know that, should additional lands in Wisconsin be brought 
   forward for wilderness designation, the type of protection they expect from federal law is still available to be extended because it had been properly extended to other places of national significance. 
   What Haslanger's Capital Times comments make clear is that while some in Congress may express concern about creating new wilderness in Utah, wilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not created by legislation. Legislation to protect existing wilderness insures that future generations may have an experience on public lands equal to that which is available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild lands by extending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 will publicly codify that expectation and promise. 
   Third, this legislation has earned my support, and deserves the support of others in this body, because all of the acres that will be protected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the federal government for the people of the United States. Thus, while they are physically located in Utah, their preservation is important to the citizens of Wisconsin as it is for other Americans. 
   Finally, I support this bill because I believe that there will likely be action during this Congress to develop consensus legislation to protect the lands contained in this proposal. We all need to be involved in helping to forge that consensus in order to ensure the best stewardship of that land. As many in this body know, the BLM has completed a review of the lands designated in the bill sponsored in the last Congress by the Senator from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN) and adjacent areas. BLM has found that 5.8 million acres of lands, slightly more than the acreage of the old bill, meet the criteria for wilderness protection under the Wilderness Act. While the re-inventory is not a formal recommendation to Congress for wilderness designation, it suggests that there are and should be more lands in play as the debate over wilderness protection in Utah moves forward. 
   I am also watching closely the on-going dialogue between Governor Leavitt and Secretary Babbitt regarding possible wilderness protection for some of the West Desert lands that are contained in this legislation, and the formal Section 202 process in which the BLM will be engaged in Utah. I hope that the leaders of those efforts will look to this legislation as a guide in identifying the areas that need to be protected as wilderness. 
   I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN) to protect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. And let me especially thank the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from South Carolina for their courtesy in allowing me to speak at this time. 
   I want to simply acknowledge that the Senator from South Carolina is, in my mind, the leader in the entire Congress on trying to make sure that we actually protect the Social Security trust fund and that it not be subject to the kind of raids it has been subjected to for the last 30 years. I give him enormous credit for that. He has been my leader on this issue. I thank him for his continued advocacy in protecting the Social Security trust fund.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, as a part of the celebration of Earth Week, I join with my other colleagues who have come to the floor calling for a renewal of this body's longstanding bipartisan commitment to the Nation's environment. I am doing so because, following the 29th Earth Day celebration tomorrow, the Nation and the 106th Congress will begin planning to commemorate three decades of Earth Days this time next year. 
   We need to begin now to shape and bring forward a positive environmental agenda which will earn the support of both political parties so that when the 30th Earth Day arrives, our actions to protect the environment will not be viewed as falling short of the mark. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, I wrote to the majority leader and the Democratic leader with suggestions of legislative areas where I believe significant opportunities actually exist for bipartisan cooperation. Among the areas I highlighted was the environment; specifically, the protection of public lands, such as passing comprehensive natural resources funding legislation which would allow the States and the Federal Government to  protect our land resources, designating new wilderness areas on our public lands, and reforming environmentally harmful subsidies that damage our lands and also hurt the American taxpayer. 
   I also think opportunities exist to try to work together to reauthorize several of our major environmental protection laws, such as Superfund, the Clean Water and Air Acts, and the Endangered Species Act. We have struggled with the reauthorization of these laws for several Congresses, and the time has come to look for ways to break the impasse on these very important issues. 
   We have also struggled, frankly, with getting more Senators involved in environmental issues as well. Several of my colleagues have remarked that with the retirement last Congress of our colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, we on the Democratic side of the aisle find ourselves having lost a consistent and persistent champion of the environment. Fortunately, we still have wonderful leaders, and I have been pleased to support the efforts of my Democratic colleagues, such as the Senator from Montana, Mr. BAUCUS, and the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, and many others of my colleagues who have stepped forward to take up these issues. But, frankly, Mr. President, none of us can do this alone. 
   Not only are environmental issues by their nature complicated and technical, but they are critically important to the American people who overwhelmingly support environmental protection. We need Senators from both parties to take up these issues and move them forward, and we are having some bipartisan successes on environmental issues where Members are working together. 
   For example, I will have the pleasure later this week of joining with my colleague, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH, in being an original cosponsor of legislation to designate the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a wilderness area. I have had the opportunity to be a cosponsor of this legislation since I joined the Senate in 1993. 
   In addition, this week I was delighted when the junior Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, decided to join me as a cosponsor of legislation I introduced to eliminate the percentage depletion allowance tax subsidy for mining on public 
   lands subject to the 1872 mining law. 
   Mr. President, part of the legacy of Earth Day is a commitment to bipartisanship, and a review of the history reveals that fact. 
   For me, celebrations of Earth Day are always intertwined with thoughts of the day's founder, former Senator Gaylord Nelson from my home State of Wisconsin. I am extremely proud to hold the Senate seat he held with distinction from 1963 to 1981. Not only did Senator Nelson help to set aside a day for the Nation to think and learn more about the environment, he acted by using the power of his office to work with colleagues to protect the environment. 
   Senator Nelson was a two-term Governor. During his gubernatorial tenure, the environment became a priority for the State of Wisconsin with the creation of the State's stewardship program, one of the important models for the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, putting Wisconsin far ahead in recreational opportunities for the general public. 
   During his 18 years in the Senate, he saw, as he is still quick to remind me, great proenvironmental change under both Republican and Democratic administrations. The Senate created the Environment and Public Works Committee, passed the majority of our Federal environmental statutes with significant bipartisan support, and created the Environmental Protection Agency. Senator Nelson himself was the author of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 84-0. He was also the primary sponsor of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Act, one of northern Wisconsin's most beautiful areas, at which I spend a portion of my vacation time with my family every year. 
   I am now the author of legislation to provide some improvements to Apostle Islands and to review these lands for their wilderness potential. In his 1969 book on the environment entitled ``America's Last Chance,'' Senator Nelson issued a political challenge which I find relevant today. He said:  
   The number one domestic problem facing this country is the threatened destruction of our natural resources and the disaster which would confront mankind should such destruction occur. There is a real question as to whether the nation, which has spent some two hundred years developing an intricate system of local, State and Federal Government to deal with the public's problems, will be bold, imaginative and flexible enough to meet this supreme test.  
   I believe Senator Nelson meant two things by his challenge. Not only did he mean that government must act immediately and decisively to protect resources in crisis, but he also meant that politicians must maintain that commitment over the long term. A renewal of this body's commitment to work together to protect the environment, fully respecting the commitment former Members of the Senate have made to us by placing us in the position of being vigilant stewards of Federal environmental laws, is an appropriate way on the eve of Earth Day to celebrate the true nature of ecological stewardship. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to be committed to that endeavor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend the senior Senator from New Jersey (Mr. LAUTENBERG) in introducing the Traffic Stops Statistics Act of 1999. This legislation represents a substantial step toward ending an insidious form of discrimination that is plaguing African-American and Hispanic drivers on our roadways--racial profiling. Most law enforcement officers do their best to respect and protect the rights of their fellow citizens, but it has become undeniable that racial profiling has become a disturbingly common practice. 
   Racial profiling is the practice of pulling over African American, Hispanic, and other minority drivers for routine traffic stops as a premise for conducting a search for drugs. They might be driving just like any ordinary driver, and so they might be surprised to be pulled over. ``Was I speeding?'' they ask. Often, they are told that they have committed some minor traffic infraction that most people are not even aware of--sometimes, the infraction is just a pretext--they might be told that their tire tread is not of the correct depth, or that they have a bumper sticker affixed incorrectly. Any such infraction can be alleged in order to pull over a target of racial profiling, and as a premise to ask for a search. Many people are not aware that they have the right to refuse a search, and many innocent people are afraid that saying no will make them look guilty. 
   The reality is, if they do refuse a search, victims can sometimes look forward to being detained anyway while a canine unit comes out to sniff for drugs. That is what happened to attorney Robert Wilkins and his family as they returned to Maryland by car from his grandfather's funeral in Chicago. Mr. Wilkins was fortunate enough to be an attorney who knew his rights, and proceeded to join with the ACLU and other groups to sue the Maryland State Police. As a result of that lawsuit, Maryland has conducted its own study of traffic stops, and the results indicate that over 75 percent of those people stopped and search on I-95 are African-American, even though African-Americans make up only 17 percent of the state's population. The innocent people who are inevitably caught in these racially motivated stops feel like they are being punished for what is now called ``DWB''--``Driving While Black,'' or ``Driving While Brown.'' 
   Mr. President, by and large when minorities are stopped by law enforcement officers, they are not attorneys, and they may not know or assert all of their rights--they are scared and they are resentful. And rightly so, when they have been the victim of racial profiling. Is this the way we want to stop the flow of drugs in America? By randomly targeting racial and ethnic minorities who are doing nothing more suspicious than driving their cars? Do we want law-abiding American citizens to feel as though they are living in a police state, scared and reluctant to travel in their cars for fear of being stopped and searched for no reason? 
   While African-Americans make up under 20% of the American population, several local studies like the Maryland one I mentioned earlier indicate that they make up a much greater percentage of all routine traffic stops, and are far more likely to be searched and subsequently arrested. In my own home state of Wisconsin, a 1996 study by the Madison Capital Times revealed that African-Americans receive 13% of Madison's traffic tickets, despite the fact that they make up only 4% of the city's population, In Florida, the Orlando Sentinel newspaper obtained more than 140 hours of videotapes from police patrol cars showing drivers being stopped on Interstate 95. About 70% of the drivers stopped were black or Hispanic, even though they made up only 5% of all drivers on the road. And in New Jersey, a recent study suggests that African Americans are almost five times as likely to be stopped for speeding as drivers of other races. 
   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that ``injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' As Americans, we should all feel threatened when any one of us is denied our personal liberty. Just last week, the United States Supreme Court took yet another step toward eradicating our Fourth Amendment rights against the invasion of our privacy. It held in Wyoming versus Houghton that police can search the personal belongings of all passengers inside a car when looking for criminal evidence against the driver. I fear that this will send a message to some law enforcement officers that they can now expand racial profiling to include not only the driver of a passing car, but also the passengers. And if you happen to be a passenger in a car that was pulled over because of the color of the driver's skin, you can now look forward to having your personal belongings searched through and pored over. 
   The Traffic Stops Statistics Study Act of 1999 will begin to shed light on the practice of racial profiling. By analyzing the data that the Justice Department obtains over the next two years, we will get a clear picture of the prevalence of the practice of pulling people over because of their skin color or apparent ethnicity. A version of this bill passed the House last year, but died in the Senate. The simultaneous introduction of this bill in the Senate and the House shows that we are serious about sending this to the President's desk. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join with us to enact this legislation. 
   It is high time to put a stop to this blatant and offensive practice, which is taking some law enforcement officers, and the rest of us, down a dangerous and discriminatory road.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator KENNEDY's amendment. This amendment will address critical needs and ensure that education investments are a top budget priority in FY 2000. 
   Mr. President, as we know the problems facing education today are great. We need a strong commitment and partnership between federal, state and local governments to meet the needs of all students. Senator KENNEDY's amendment will strengthen the effort to reduce class size, provide the full 40% federal share of special education program costs and free up resources for other education priorities. Importantly, this amendment is paid for in the budget we are now debating with a simple 20% reduction in the $778 billion tax cut proposed by the majority. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, some of my colleagues who oppose this amendment are in effect asking school districts to choose between providing smaller class sizes and funding for special education. This is a false choice, Mr. President. Both special education and small class size are important national priorities, both deserve funding and we can responsibly fund these programs without busting the budget. Forcing school districts to choose between these critically important education programs will only dilute the effectiveness of both programs. 
   Mr. President, funding for smaller class sizes should not be a partisan issue. Last year when we agreed to fund a serious effort to reduce class size there was broad support for the program proclaimed on both sides of the aisle. What has changed Mr. President? Only a few months after praising the class size program, some are now blocking class size funds and have pit one valuable education program against another all to fund a tax cut we cannot yet afford. 
   Mr. President, there is wide consensus, based on solid research, that investing in smaller class size is the right thing to do. Research shows that smaller classes help teachers provide more personal attention to students and spend less time on discipline, as a result students learn more and get a stronger foundation in the basic skills. My own state of Wisconsin is doing its part to reduce class size. Wisconsin's Student Achievement Guarantee in Education or SAGE class size reduction program, has proven conclusively that smaller classes make a difference in our children's education. Mr. President, SAGE officials in Wisconsin want a partnership with the federal government. Now is the time when school districts in Wisconsin and in other states are making budget decisions, they need to know if Congress will meet its commitment to reduce class size over the next six years to plan effectively. 
   Again, Mr. President, I support Senator KENNEDY's amendment because I believe Congress should meet both the commitment to help schools reduce class size and increase funding for special education without busting the budget. I hope my colleagues agree that we should not waste this unique opportunity to responsibly make the needed investments in education today for our children's future.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few observations on the budget resolution, and on some recent developments that relate closely to our budget position. 
   In particular, I want to sound a note of caution to my colleagues, and urge that we refrain from basing our budget on the assumption that we will have significant budget surpluses in the near future. 
   Mr. President, the last six years or so have seen some dramatic improvements in our Federal budget position. 
   In part, this has been due to some tough budget discipline on the part of the White House and Congress. 
   In part, it has come as a result of a strong economy, itself the beneficiary of our budget discipline. 
   In January of 1993, I don't think anyone would have seriously predicted that we would be on the brink not only of balancing the unified budget, but also of eliminating the on-budget deficit, producing a balanced budget without having to rely on the Social Security Trust Fund balances to make up the difference. 
   Now that we are so close to actually balancing the government's books without using Social Security, some recent developments are all the more troubling to me. 
   I'll just note a few of them. 
   Let me begin with last year's half trillion dollar omnibus appropriations bill. 
   That measure was not only loaded up with special interest provisions, it ended up spending $20 billion over budget by using the emergency spending exceptions to our budget caps. 
   There were a number of reasons the bill ended up the way it did, and let me say that I hope the biennial budget measure offered by the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee (Mr. DOMENICI) can help prevent such situations from arising again. 
   I served in the Wisconsin State Legislature for 10 years using a biennial approach to budgeting, and I think such a structure at the Federal level might help prevent the kind of last minute omnibus appropriations bill we had last year where abuse of the budget process is almost inevitable. 
   Mr. President, I had hoped the new Congress would start off on a more fiscally responsible foot after having produced the omnibus appropriations bill last fall. 
   But I was disappointed that the first major piece of legislation we took up was just more of the same. 
   The bill that passed the Senate recently, S. 4, was another giant budget buster, providing spending increases of more than $50 billion over the next 10 years without a penny of offsetting savings elsewhere. 
   And it did so before Congress has had a chance to pass a budget resolution, even before this committee has produced a budget resolution for floor debate. 
   Mr. President, there was no reason to rush that bill through. 
   A pay hike for our armed forces would have received solid support as part of an overall budget plan. S. 4 was a politically popular bill, and rightly so. 
   There are good arguments for providing members of our armed forces and the national guard and reserve a pay hike. 
   Indeed, I very much want to support a pay hike for them. 
   But not outside of an overall budget plan, and not in a measure that busts the budget. 
   Mr. President, this brings me to the President's budget, the budget resolution reported out of the Budget Committee, and the alternative budgets various interests have proposed. 
   Each of these budget proposals is centered around the use of projected budget surpluses. 
   Indeed, it is the use of those very surpluses that in a sense defines the goals of these budget proposals, and distinguishes one from another. 
   Mr. President, as I noted before, we have come a long way in the last 6 years. 
   We now have the opportunity to achieve a truly balanced budget, one that does not rely on Social Security Trust Fund balances. 
   We are within striking distance of producing genuine surpluses. 
   But let me emphasize, we may be within striking distance, but we aren't there yet. 
   Mr. President, we do not have a budget surplus now, and I am concerned that for several reasons we may not achieve one. 
   While subsequent estimates may change, the most recent CBO estimates show we do not have a budget surplus this year, and CBO does not project a genuine on-budget surplus of any significant size until FY2002, when a $55 billion on-budget surplus is projected. 
   Mr. President, even those modest surpluses are based on assumptions that may prove to be overly optimistic. 
   CBO currently projects non-Social Security surpluses of slightly over $800 billion over the next ten years. 
   But in making those projections, CBO assumes that total discretionary spending will remain under the caps we agreed to in 1997, and that after 2002,  total discretionary spending will be held to inflationary increases only. 
   Mr. President, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, these assumptions mean that discretionary spending over the next 10 years will be $580 billion below current levels in real terms. 
   Put another way, if we simply held discretionary spending at a level which reflects current services, and adjusted only for inflation, nearly three-quarters of the projected surpluses over the next 10 years will vanish. 
   Mr. President, some will argue Congress and the White House will hold to the spending caps, and will cut the amount of spending necessary to produce the projected surpluses. 
   Let me suggest that given the omnibus appropriations bill of last fall, the military pay increase bill of last month, and the desire of so many to focus on the surpluses we hope for, those assumptions about limiting our spending appear to be extremely fragile. 
   Beyond our ability to live up to the spending and tax assumptions that produce the projected surpluses, we know that projections can change quickly. 
   Just since last August, the CBO projections for unified budget surpluses over the next 10 years have increased by about $1 trillion--a change that is itself larger than the non-Social Security surplus over that same period. 
   Estimates that can grow by $1 trillion in a few months can shrink by the same amount just as quickly. 
   Altogether, Mr. President, the projected surpluses are far from a sure thing, and we should not be writing budgets that commit us to spending and taxing policies that are so utterly dependent on them.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senators KENNEDY, JOHNSON, LEAHY, WELLSTONE, INOUYE, KERRY, and others in introducing the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act. 
   Mr. President, the sky-rocketing cost of prescription drugs has long been among the top 2 or 3 issues my constituents in Wisconsin call and write to me about. The problem of expensive prescription drugs is particularly acute among Wisconsin senior citizens who live on fixed incomes. Nationally, prescription drugs are Senior Citizens' largest single out-of-pocket health care expenditure: the average Senior spends $100-$200 month on prescription drugs. 
   As you may know, Mr. President, last fall, a study by the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee found that the average price seniors pay for prescription drugs is twice as high as that enjoyed by favored customers--big purchasers such as HMOs and the federal government. The Committee's report found a price differential in one case was 1400%, meaning that the retail price a typical senior citizen paid was $27.05, while the favored customer was charged only $1.75. 
   To be sure, Mr. President, the Committee's report did find that Wisconsin had lower price differentials compared to other parts of the country, an 85% differential compared to a high of 123% in California. But I think my constituents would find that a pretty hollow distinction. There's not doubt in my mind that paying 85% more than others are charged for the same product is unfair, plain and simple. 
   Mr. President, as we all know, traditional Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. While some Medicare managed care plans offer a prescription drug benefit, few of those managed care plans operate in Wisconsin or in other largely rural states. So, while pharmaceutical companies give lower prices to favored customers who buy in bulk, small community pharmacies such as we have throughout Wisconsin lack this purchasing power, meaning that Seniors who purchase their prescriptions drugs at those small pharmacies get the high prices passed on to them. 
   Mr. President, I regularly get calls from Seniors on tight, fixed incomes who tell me that they have to choose between buying groceries and buying groceries and buying their prescription drugs. I would guess that many of my colleagues receive similar calls from their constituents. Calls like these, and the fact that prices are only getting higher as scientific advances develop new medications, tell me that we must take action to make prescription drugs more affordable to Seniors. 
   The legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today will require that pharmaceutical companies offer senior citizens the same discounts that they offer to their most favored customers. Through this legislation, we take an important step in making costly but vitally important prescription drugs more affordable to the Seniors who need them. I thank the chair.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment (Amendment # 152) being introduced today by the Senators from Oregon [Mr. SMITH] and Maryland [Mr. SARBANES]. 
   This amendment expresses the Sense of the Senate that the resources identified in the underlying budget resolution for Function 150 (International Affairs) be sufficient to enable successful U.S. international leadership. 
   Mr. President, this is an enormously important amendment that comes at a critical time. Function 150 encompasses the majority of our international programs including the operating budget of the Department of State. Representing barely one percent of our entire federal budget, our investment in Function 150 is the American investment in our national security. 
   The post-Cold War era has brought with it new challenges and new responsibilities for the world's only remaining superpower. Yet real spending for International Affairs has declined more than 50 percent since the mid-1980s. 
   Mr. President, national security can not be viewed solely through a defense lens, but also must comprise all the critical preventative measures offered through an active foreign affairs program. This means continuing to be active in fighting the spread of disease and drugs, providing adequate nutrition for children and families, and pursuing U.S. goals in arms reduction. I also believe we should continue to make appropriate contributions to the multilateral institutions, in particular the United Nations, on which the United States relies. 
   In short, Mr. President, only through committed support to both diplomacy and defense can we utilize all the tools available to us to protect our national security and advance our overseas interests.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns regarding two troubling sections of S. 544, the Supplemental Appropriations bill. Section 2002 further delays the promulgation of new regulations governing the management of hardrock mineral mining operations on federal public lands. Section 2005 extends the moratorium on the issuance of new regulations by the Minerals Management Service regarding oil valuation. I hope that all provisions which adversely affect the implementation of environmental law, or change federal environmental policy, will be removed from this legislation when it returns to the floor. 
   I want to note, before I describe my concerns in detail, that this is not the first time that I have expressed concerns regarding legislative riders in appropriations legislation that would have a negative impact on our nation's environment. 
   Mr. President, for more than two decades, we have seen a remarkable bipartisan consensus on protecting the environment through effective environmental legislation and regulation. I believe we have a responsibility to the American people to protect the quality of our public lands and resources. That responsibility requires that I express my strong distaste for legislative efforts to include proposals in spending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially beneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated by the federal agencies that carry out federal law. 
   Mr. President, the people of Wisconsin continue to express their grave concern that, when riders are placed in spending bills, major decisions regarding environmental protection are being  made without the benefit of an up or down vote. 
   Wisconsinites have a very strong belief that Congress has a responsibility to discuss and publicly debate matters affecting the environment. We should be on record with regard to our position on this matter of open government and environmental stewardship. 
   Mr. President, I have particular concerns regarding Section 2002. I think this rider is another attempt to move us away from implementing new mining regulations. This is the third time, in as many years, that a rider has been put forward on this matter. The rider, as drafted, would delay the regulatory process for at least an additional 120 days beyond the final rider compromise language in the Omnibus bill which passed in October 1999. The Omnibus language says that the regulations can not be issued before September 30, 1999. There is no basis for arguing that the Interior Department would not have time to review the on-going National Academy of Sciences study on this topic, which the Omnibus language required to be completed by July 31, 1999. 
   The ``3809'' mining regulations, as they are called, are the environmental rules that govern hardrock mining on publicly owned lands. 
   The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 directs the Secretary of the Interior to ``take any action necessary, by regulation or otherwise, to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation on the federal lands.'' The regulations in question are the Bureau of Land Management's promulgated in response to the requirements of this federal law. 
   The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill mining rider blocks the issuance of the final 3809 regulations certainly through the end of the fiscal year. The language further blocks the Administration from spending funds to seek public input on its new draft regulations until after the National Academy of Sciences issues its on-going study examining the adequacy of the existing patchwork of fedeal and state mining rules, as I mentioned earlier. 
   The rules are important, Mr. President, and so is the need to update them. Mining technologies, according to the Interior Department, have outgrown existing safeguards. The original regulations, released in 1981, have never been revised. Since that time, the mining industry has widely adopted new extraction technologies which raise environmental questions and concerns. One such technique, which caused grave concern two years ago in my state when it was proposed for use on private lands in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, was the use of sulfuric acid mining. 
   In addition, Mr. President, existing regulations also need to allow the BLM to balance the fact that multiple activities take place on lands before permitting new mines. In determining whether a proposed mine is appropriate, BLM is not permitted to take into account other land uses that would be displaced by mining. 
   Finally, I believe that existing regulations don't do enough to require meaningful cleanup. Currently there is no requirement to restore mined lands to pre-mining conditions and they leave taxpayers paying for the mining industry's mistakes. To address this issue, I recently introduced legislation to repeal the percentage depletion allowance for mining on public lands and I set aside a portion of the increased revenue to be used to create an Abandoned Mine Reclamation fund. Any clean-up fund, however, needs good clean-up standards to put it to use. 
   In conclusion, I think that continued delay of these regulations is indefensible, and certainly inappropriate as part of a supplemental bill.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my thoughts to this critical debate about the potential deployment of United States troops to Kosovo as part of a NATO peacekeeping mission. I commend the Senator from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, for her commitment to ensuring that the Members of this body have the opportunity to fully debate this important issue. 
   I also commend the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator SMITH, for his work on this issue, and I share his contention that the President should seek congressional authorization prior to ordering a deployment to Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, like all of us, I am gravely concerned about the situation in Kosovo. More than 2,000 people, including women and children, have been killed since the fighting between ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces escalated just over a year ago. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee from their homes and hide in the woods during the cold winter months. Those that are able to return to their villages often find their possessions looted and their homes burned. Recent television news reports have shown Serb police shamelessly waiving to the cameras as they steal televisions and other valuables from the deserted homes of ethnic Albanians before setting the homes on fire. 
   Even today, as peace talks have adjourned without an agreement, the violence continues in Kosovo. I am pleased that four representatives from the Kosovar Albanian delegation last week signed the so-called Rambouillet agreement. However, I am alarmed that the government in Belgrade continues to offer ultimatums and to deploy troops and tanks in Kosovo. The continued defiance of President Slobodan Milosevic and other Serb leaders is very troubling. Once again, NATO has threatened airstrikes against Belgrade if the Milosevic government does not comply with the will of the international community. Once agains, Belgrade has refused. 
   Last week, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe evacuated its observers from Kosovo in anticipation of possible NATO airstrikes. The violence in Kosovo has continued, with the aggression from both sides of this conflict. 
   As we debate this important issue, United States Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke is again in Belgrade attempting one last time to convince President Milosevic to cease his operations against the Kosovar Albanians and embark on a path to peace. Although I commend Mr. Holbrooke for his efforts, and hope, of course, that he is successful, I am skeptical. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe that it is critical for Congress to take an active role in the debate and decision to send our men and women in uniform into any potentially hostile situation. As our constituents' voices in matters of policy, we in Congress must fully debate this important issue and vote up or down on whether or not to authorize such a deployment. 
   While I am pleased that the European members of NATO are taking the lead on the proposed deployment to Kosovo to implement the Rambouillet agreement, I have serious concerns about the United States participation in the form of U.S. troops in that mission. 
   No matter how one feels about the conflict in Kosovo or about the future of that province, under current American policy Kosovo is considered part of  Serbia, comprising, along with Montenegro, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had made it abundantly clear that NATO troops are not welcome on what he refers to as ``Serb territory,'' and he has begun to amass troops along the border with Macedonia, where approximately 12,000 NATO troops are already currently deployed. 
   In addition, for the moment, there is no peace to be kept by the peacekeeping force. While the Kosovar Albanian delegation in France has signed the Rambouillet agreement, the Serbs remain adamant that they will not sign the agreement unless the Kosovar Albanians and the Contact Group accept their latest demands. Many observers see this as a stalling tactic on the part of the Serbs, since they are demanding changes to text that already has been agreed upon. 
   It is into this very uncertain situation and environment that the President has proposed to deploy 4,000 United States troops. 
   Mr. President, with great regret, I have concluded that I must oppose the deployment of U.S. troops to Kosovo at this time. I am compelled to do so for several reasons. 
   First, the potential for harm to our men and women in uniform is too great, and there is too much uncertainty surrounding the proposed deployment. The continuing violence in Kosovo, coupled with the mobilization of Serb troops in the area, fosters a volatile environment into which our troops should not be deployed. The fact that the Serbs are not presently willing to sign the Rambouillet agreement or allow NATO troops into Kosovo makes it hard to believe that there will be any peace at all for foreign troops to keep. 
   Second, since 1995, I have vigorously opposed the deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia. One can draw disturbing parallels between the deployment to Bosnia and the proposed deployment to Kosovo. The administration, in my opinion, has again failed to make the case to the American people and to the Congress for the deployment of U.S. ground troops in the Balkans. As with the Bosnia mission, there is no clear set of goals beyond ``maintaining'' a currently nonexistent peace, there is no timetable for withdrawal, no cost estimate, and no exit strategy. 
   Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the Senate many times in the last 3 years to talk about the U.S. deployment to Bosnia. I have consistently opposed that deployment and have supported a number of attempts to end it. I cannot help but think that this proposed deployment to Kosovo is another in the long line of ill-fated and seemingly unending peacekeeping missions that this administration has chosen to undertake without the explicit authorization of the Congress.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am seriously concerned that the administration has cited the Bosnia mission as some kind of positive precedent for a deployment to Kosovo--or anywhere else. In my view, the mission to Bosnia should not be a precedent for anything. The deployment to Bosnia has resulted in, of course, some real benefits for the people of that region, but it has resulted in less favorable consequences for the United States. However, the lack of clear goals and a timetable for U.S. withdrawal, and the glaring absence of an exit strategy, now more than 3 years later, and more than $9 billion after the initial deployment, remain troubling. 
   Let me repeat that. We were promised that the troops would be out of Bosnia in 1 year, that the troops would be home by December of 1996; and after we were promised that, we would spend at the most $2 billion. Our troops are still there, and it has cost over $9 or $10 billion. And now they do not even talk about getting out on any date certain. Any new deployment to the Balkans must not unduly add to the spiraling cost American taxpayers are being asked to bear for our already very, very expensive mission in Bosnia. 
   I do not want to see the mistakes of Bosnia repeated in Kosovo at the expense of our men and women in uniform. Our armed services have served very admirably in the Balkans. They and their families and fellow citizens have a right to know the details of the proposed deployment before it happens. 
   Third, I am concerned that the proposed deployment to Kosovo could set a new precedent for international peacekeeping. As we prepare to mark NATO's 50th anniversary, the topic of continued out-of-area NATO deployments for peacekeeping is a valid point of concern. How do we justify United States participation in NATO missions in Bosnia and Kosovo but not in international deployments in Rwanda, Sierra Leone, or the Congo, where many of the same tragic types of occurrences have been occurring for several years? Violent civil wars have shredded the fabric of civil society around the globe, but it doesn't seem to me, after observing this for over 6 years, that we have a clear principle for deciding where and when to intervene. No such principle emerges from the observation and the justifications for both the Bosnia and Kosovo proposed intervention. 
   Finally, I am concerned about the deployment of our men and women in uniform to Kosovo because our troops are already stretched too thin around the globe. Currently, there are more than a quarter-million American troops deployed in foreign areas, from Haiti, to Bosnia, to the Persian Gulf, to the Korean peninsula. When I talk to my constituents, they are startled to hear that there is something like a quarter-million American troops, approximately 250,000 American troops, stationed around the world at this time. 
   I commend again our men and women in uniform for their service to our country. I cannot, however, support a policy that overcommits our American troops abroad, especially when the situation into which they would be sent in Kosovo is so very uncertain. Again, there will be more debate on this, and I think that is terribly important. 
   I conclude my remarks by thanking the Senators from Texas and New Hampshire for their work on this issue. I am also pleased that the House of Representatives took an opportunity to debate this extremely important issue and that the Senate has followed suit today. 
   Again, I regret that I am unable to support the deployment of U.S. troops to Kosovo at this time.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was pleased to join 97 of my colleagues to vote in favor of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, or Ed-Flex, last week. This bill expands the current federal Ed-Flex pilot program to all states and allows them to waive certain federal education requirements for local schools, so long as schools are accountable for making education improvements, and does so without altering federal requirements concerning health, safety and civil rights. It is my hope that Ed-Flex can help increase student achievement by serving as a catalyst for innovative school reform at the state and local levels. 
   Mr. President, while I am pleased the Senate passed the underlying Ed-Flex bill, I am disappointed that the bill includes amendments that would force local schools to choose between smaller classes and students with special needs. These amendments could undermine the important class size reduction program agreed to on a bipartisan basis last year. I was also deeply disappointed with the defeat of the Kennedy/Murray class size amendment, which would have built on the down payment of 30,000 teachers agreed to last year and finished the job by authorizing class size funding for the next six years. 
   My own State of Wisconsin has been a leader among the states trying to reduce class size in the early grades. Wisconsin's Student Achievement Guarantee in Education or SAGE class size reduction program, has proven conclusively that smaller classes make a difference in our children's education. SAGE officials want the Federal Government to be a partner in Wisconsin's effort to reduce class size. Federal funds are an important complement to Wisconsin's ongoing SAGE program and will ensure that SAGE continues to thrive. The rejection of the Kennedy/Murrary amendment sends a discouraging message to schools in my State and across the nation that are just beginning to make decisions about how to implement the class size funds agreed to last year. 
   It is very unfortunate Mr. President that two critically important federal programs, funds for special education and to reduce class size, were pitted against each other during the Ed-Flex debate. I am fully committed to funding for special education, but not at the expense of funds to reduce class size. The promise of these critically important education funds affecting our nation's children should not fall victim to partisan maneuvers. Congress should not be choosing one over the other--both special education and class size are national education priorities. American parents should know those in Congress who pit these programs against each other are the friend of neither. 
   Finally, Mr. President, while I understand that Ed-Flex is not a panacea for America's education problems, I do believe it will improve the federal, state and local partnership needed to ensure our children receive the best quality education possible. I am confident that the conference committee will protect the class size funds agreed to last year and that Congress will vote on an improved version of Ed-Flex in the near future.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to honor and to thank a true American hero. A man who risked his life to defend this nation and continues to serve this nation. I am proud to say that J. ROBERT KERREY is a friend and colleague. 
   Mr. President, thirty years ago this Sunday, on March 14, 1969, BOB KERREY led a team of Navy SEALs onto an island in the Bay of Nha Trang. In the course of battle, an enemy grenade exploded at his feet. He wound up losing his right leg below the knee, but BOB directed fire into the enemy camp, resulting in its capture. His extraordinary valor cost him part of his leg, but it earned him the respect of every American. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to join Senators DASCHLE, EDWARDS, and HAGEL on this resolution honoring the only Medal of Honor winner in the current Congress. The Medal of Honor is the highest military award for valor that can be conferred on a member of the American armed forces. It is awarded to a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine who ``..... in action involving actual conflict with the enemy, distinguish[es] himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life, above and beyond the call of duty.'' 
   It is that spirit we honor today, which has time and again moved ordinary Americans to rise to every threat to our nation and stand against great odds. It is the spirit that sustained the Revolution at Valley Forge, that carried the day at Gettysburg and Belleau Wood, and that made the difference at the Battle of the Bulge and Iwo Jima. This is the spirit that crashed ashore at Inchon, sustained our resolve at Khe Sanh and swept through the deserts along the Persian Gulf. 
   And BOB KERREY has showed courage in public life. Whether it's Social Security, Medicare, the budget or protection of the First Amendment, BOB KERREY is not afraid to take the unpopular position. Above all, I admire his willingness to act and speak according to his conscience.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a tribute to my friend, Phil Lerman, who recently passed away. Throughout his lifetime, Phil was a steadfast advocate for civil rights. Perhaps most impressive, is the number of different avenues Phil marched down to promote the ideals of equal justice. As a former union representative, state official, businessman, founder and director of the employment and training institute at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Phil helped to promote racial and social justice throughout the state of Wisconsin. 
   Phil said that he learned his ``strategizing and speechifying,'' as he called it, for civil rights from his father. In a 1997 interview, Phil stated ``I learned to respect people as people. Color meant nothing.'' Perhaps it was this respect that caused Phil to devote time to preforming countless acts of community service, such as donating free tires to the vehicles that carried so many civil rights marchers. 
   Phil was an inspiration to the entire state. I am sure those in the greater Milwaukee area will miss his guidance and helpful advice. However, I am proud to remember, and of course repeat, his well-worn statement, ``a house doesn't care who lives there.'' I can only hope that we will someday translate this ideal into reality.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sorrow over the loss of my friend, and former teacher, George Mosse. George was truly an extraordinary man, a great humanist and a wonderful teacher. While his 25 books were influential, he would not want us to forget that we were almost deprived of his brilliance. Lucky for us, George was able to escape the Nazis at age 19 by way of Switzerland. 
   I had the honor of studying under George at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His lectures were unique in both their style and subject. George first developed his dynamic, bellowing style while at the University of Iowa, where he taught classes of up to 1,000 students. He is perhaps best known for his work on Nazi Germany, but his later work on subjects like national symbols and monuments was equally as impressive. 
   In addition to his countless articles and essays, George was simply a wonderful teacher. His challenging and invigorating teaching style compelled his students to learn. I think many of his students naively took for granted his endless lack of energy and ideas. This expectation is understandable given his almost ritualistic process of exploring a new and dynamic area of study each decade. The University of Wisconsin, and the field of history, have truly lost an asset, but his work will surely live on.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to eliminate from the federal tax code percentage depletion allowances for hardrock minerals mined on federal public lands. I am joined in introducing this legislation by my colleague from Vermont, Mr. LEAHY. 
   The President proposes the elimination of the percentage depletion allowance on public lands in his FY 2000 budget. The President's FY 2000 budget estimates that, under this legislation, income to the federal treasury from the elimination of percentage depletion allowances for hardrock mining on public lands would total $478 million over five years, more than $95 million in this year alone. These savings are calculated as the excess amount of federal revenues above what would be collected if depletion allowances were limited to ``sunk costs'' in capital investments. Percentage depletion allowances are contained in the tax code for extracted fuel, minerals, metal and other mined commodities. These allowances have a combined value, according to 1994 estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, of $4.8 billion. 
   Mr. President, these percentage depletion allowances were initiated by the Corporation Excise Act of 1909. That's right, 1909. Provisions for a depletion allowance based on the value of the mine were made under a 1912 Treasury Department regulation, but difficulty in applying this accounting principle to mineral production led to the initial codification of the mineral depletion allowance in the Tariff Act of 1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 established percentage depletion much in its present form for oil and gas. The percentage depletion allowance was then extended to metal mines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by the Revenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted several times since. 
   Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the tax code to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction industries far below tax rates on other industries, providing incentives to increase investment, exploration and output. However, percentage depletion also makes it possible to recover many times the amount of the original investment. 
   There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to recover the costs of their capital investment: cost depletion, and percentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the actual capital investment--the costs of discovering, purchasing, and developing a mineral reserve--over the period during which the reserve produces income. Using  cost depletion, a company would deduct a portion of its original capital investment minus any previous deductions, in an amount that is equal to the fraction of the remaining recoverable reserves. Under this method, the total deductions cannot exceed the original capital investment. 
   However, under percentage depletion, the deduction for recovery of a company's investment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income''--namely, sales revenue--from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total deductions typically exceed, let me be clear on that point, Mr. President, exceed the capital that the company invested. 
   The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 of the U.S. Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 metals and minerals, at rates ranging from 10 percent to 22 percent. 
   In addition to repealing the percentage depletion allowances for minerals mined on public lands, Mr. President, my bill also creates a new fund, called the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. One fourth of the revenue raised by the bill, or approximately $120 million dollars, will be deposited into an interest bearing fund in the Treasury to be used to clean up abandoned hardrock mines in states that are subject to the 1872 Mining Law. Mineral Policy Center estimates that there are 557,650 hardrock abandoned mine sites nationwide and the cost of cleaning them up will range from $32.7 billion to $71.5 billion. 
   There are currently no comprehensive federal or state programs to address the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites requires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up abandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a first step toward providing the needed authority and resources. 
   Mr. President, in today's budget climate we are faced with the question of who should bear the costs of exploration, development, and production of natural resources: all taxpayers, or the users and producers of the resource? For more than a century, the mining industry has been paying next to nothing for the privilege of extracting minerals from public lands and then abandoning its mines. Now those mines are adding to the nation's environmental and financial burdens. We face serious budget choices this fiscal year, yet these subsidies remain a persistent tax expenditure that raise the deficit for all citizens or shift a greater tax burden to other taxpayers to compensate for the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry. 
   Mr. President, the measure I am introducing is fairly straightforward. It eliminates the percentage depletion allowance for hardrock minerals mined on public lands while continuing to allow companies to recover reasonable cost depletion. 
   Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a government-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, there is now sufficient reason to adopt a more reasonable depletion allowance that is consistent with those given to other businesses. 
   Mr. President, the time has come for the Federal Government to get out of the business of subsidizing business. We can no longer afford its costs in dollars or its cost to the health of our citizens. This legislation is one step toward the goal of ending these corporate welfare subsidies.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr President, today we mark a tragic anniversary, 40 years after His Holiness the Dalai Lama and more than 100,000 Tibetans were forced to flee their homeland as a result of brutal suppression by the Chinese government. 
   Tibetans were driven from their homes, freedom was driven from Tibet, and the Chinese Government began in earnest its campaign to destroy Tibet's culture, religion, and national identity. 
   But this campaign will never succeed, because Tibet, and the human rights of the Tibetan people, are not China's for the taking. It's been said that ``a right is not what someone gives you; it's what no one can take from you.'' The Tibetan people have a right to their freedom, a right to openly practice their religion, and a right to live with dignity and without fear. 
   These human rights--that belong to Tibetans, and to people everywhere--bind us to the Tibetan people with a tie stronger than the Chinese government's oppression, mightier than the Chinese government's policies of destruction, and more powerful than the Chinese or any government's attempt to take that which cannot be taken--the dignity of the human spirit. 
   I am calling on the Administration to pursue a resolution condemning China's human rights practices in China and Tibet at the upcoming U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, an action the Senate unanimously endorsed by recorded vote in late February. Only through strong U.S. leadership can we build the international consensus necessary to pressure China to provide the basic human rights the Tibetan people deserve. The time to press for these fundamental rights is now and the place is the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Kennedy/Murray class size amendment. As we know, Mr. President, education is serious concern for people across the country, and I am pleased to see an education bill as one of the first priorities in this Congress. 
   Mr. President, last year Congress provided a one-time appropriation in the omnibus budget bill to hire approximately 30,000 new teachers across the country. The Kennedy/Murray amendment we are considering today authorizes a continuation of this effort for the next 6 years. This sends the signal to local school districts that Congress understands the importance of smaller classes and is committed to funding for class size reduction. This amendment takes a positive step toward helping school districts reduce class size as part of an overall effort to improve education and ensure that our children have the best chance to excel and reach their full potential. 
   As my own state of Wisconsin can attest--smaller classes make a difference in student's lives. Wisconsin's Student Achievement Guarantee in Education or SAGE program, now in its third year, continues to be a model for the nation in how to implement successfull education reforms in our public schools by reducting public school class size in the earliest grades. I am very proud that Wisconsin's SAGE program is leading the charge to reduce public school class size across the nation, and pleased that this amendment will help keep SAGE thriving in Wisconsin. 
   The recently released second year SAGE evaluation again empirically demonstrates what we instinctively know; students in smaller classes get more attention from teachers and teachers with fewer students have more time and energy to devote to each child. Specifically, the first and second year evaluations confirm the achievements of SAGE students in all tested areas: mathematics, reading and language arts. The report shows total scores for SAGE students were significantly higher than those students at comparison schools. 
   The evidence shows that teachers in small classes can provide students with more individualized attention, spend more time on instruction and less on other tasks and cover more material more effectively. Again, Mr. President, SAGE has shown conclusively that the significance of small class size should not be underestimated and cannot be ignored. 
   Class size should be at the forefront of the education agenda because there is a great national purpose in helping local schools reduce class size for children in the earliest grades. I would like to state Mr. President my strong belief that education should remain solidly a state and local function. However, I believe the federal government can have a constructive role supporting local efforts. Kennedy/Murray class size proposal is a perfect example. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reach across the aisle to ensure that education is a top priority in the 160th Congress. I look forward to working in a bipartisan manner to reach consensus on these important issues to ensure that our children receive the highest quality education possible.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of legislation introduced by the senior Senator from my home State of Wisconsin. Today, Senator KOHL has introduced a measure important not only to Wisconsin's dairy farmers but to dairy farmers all over the country. 
   The National Dairy Promotion and Research Program collects roughly $225 million every year from American dairy farmers, who each pay a mandatory 15 cents into the program for every 100 pounds of milk they produce. This program is designed to promote dairy products to consumers and to conduct research relating to milk processing and marketing. 
   While 15 cents may appear to be a small amount of money, multiplied by all the millions of pounds of milk marketed in this country, it adds up to thousands of dollars each year for the average domestic producer. Given the magnitude of this program, it is critical that Congress take seriously the concerns producers have about the way their promotion program is run. This legislation addresses one of the most important of those concerns: importers reap the same promotional benefits as their U.S. counterparts, yet they don't pay a dime into the program. 
   The National Dairy Promotion and Research Board conducts generic promotion and general product research. Domestic farmers and importers alike benefit from these actions. This bill, Mr. President, provides equity to domestic producers who have been footing the bill for this promotion program all by themselves for over 10 years. 
   The Dairy Promotion Fairness Act requires that all dairy product importers contribute to the Dairy Promotion Program at the same rate as domestic dairy farmers. This is not an unusual proposal, Mr. President. Many of our largest generic promotion programs for other commodities already assess importers for their fair share of the program, including programs for pork, beef, and cotton. 
   This legislation is particularly important in light of the 1994 passage of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). GATT has boosted imports of dairy products in the past several years. A dairy promotion assessment on importers would also be allowed under GATT since our own milk producers are already paying the same assessment. 
   We have put our own producers at a competitive disadvantage for far too long. It's high time importers paid for their fair share of this program. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to end the subsidization of foreign farmers on the backs of our own.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join others around the world in marking International Women's Day. This day celebrates the contributions and accomplishments of women worldwide, and also reminds us that, unfortunately, many women are still treated as second-class citizens. Gender-based discrimination and harassment, domestic violence, and sexual assault are far too common in too many places. The glass ceiling, while perhaps a bit cracked, still blocks the progress of many women who work outside the home. Lack of affordable quality child care forces many women to make a painful decision between their children and their careers. 
   The wage gap between men and women around the world is still vast. According to 1997 statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, American women working outside the home in non-agricultural jobs earn about seventy-five percent of what their male counterparts earn; that is, seventy-five cents on the dollar. International Labour Organization statistics from 1996 state that women in Japan make sixty-two percent of what their male counterparts earn; the figure in Kenya is eighty-five percent. Australian women fare better, earning virtually the same wages as men. 
   In many places, women and girls are not considered valued members of society. Rather, their basic human rights are curtailed, sometimes to the point of denial of adequate medical care and basic educational opportunities. The illegal trafficking of women and girls for purposes such as slavery and prostitution is rampant in some areas of the world. In some places, it is common for women to be burned with acid by their husbands if their dowries are not large enough. 
   The deplorable practice of so-called ``honor killing''--men murdering female relatives accused of things ranging from infidelity to objection to an arranged marriage--is again receiving international attention. What is even more deplorable is that the men committing these murders take pride in their crimes, which they justify as cultural tradition, and are routinely given light prison sentences. Some women endure voluntary imprisonment to escape male relatives who intend to murder them.  
   Despite the challenges they face--or maybe in spite of them--women in the United States and around the world contribute to their families and their countries in countless ways. 
   In the United States, March is Women's History Month. It is a time to celebrate the contributions of women such as Carrie Chapman Catt, a native of Ripon, Wisconsin, who served as the last president of the National American Women Suffrage Association, and was the founder and first president of the National League of Women Voters. Her influence on the direction and success of the suffrage movement is legendary, and her legacy in grassroots organizing is equally significant. She led a tireless lobbying campaign in Congress, sent letters and telegrams, and eventually met directly with the President--using all the tools of direct action with which political organizers are now so familiar today. 
   Catt's crusade for suffrage saw a homefront victory on June 10, 1919, when Wisconsin became the first state to deliver ratification of the constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote before it was adopted as the Nineteenth Amendment in August of 1920. 
   The legacy of Carrie Chapman Catt is alive and well today--in Wisconsin and across the globe--as women take a more and more active role in the political process. I am proud to serve alongside Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN, the first woman elected to Congress from Wisconsin. The 106th Congress includes a record 67 women--nine in the Senate and 58 in the House of Representatives. 
   As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have monitored how the women of Africa participate in the political process and make vital contributions to the economies of their countries. During the recent assembly and presidential elections in Nigeria, women served as poll workers and were candidates for the assembly. I regret that voter turnout among women was noticeably low, but was pleased to see some progress being made. 
   One way in which the Senate can honor women worldwide is to fulfill our long-overdue constitutional obligation to offer our advice and consent to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) at the earliest possible date. This year marks the 20th anniversary of CEDAW, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 18, 1979. CEDAW was signed by the United States on July 17, 1980, and was transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent by President Carter on November 12, 1980. Almost two decades later, the treaty is still pending before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. As of December 1998, 163 countries have ratified CEDAW. Only three signatories have yet to ratify the convention: Afghanistan, San Tome and Principe, and the United States. It is high time for us to ratify this important document. 
   In closing, Mr. President, as the father of two daughters, I am hopeful that the world we leave to our children and grandchilren will be deviod of domestic violence and other forms of gender-based discrimination, harrassment, and violence. As we prepare to enter the 21st century, we must redouble our efforts to protect and promote the rights of women and girls at home and abroad.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just over a week ago we witnessed a seminal event in Nigeria, the West African country that could hold the key to stability and prosperity in the region. Millions of Nigerians participated in an election to select the first civilian president in almost two decades. Since gaining its independence in 1960, Nigeria has survived a number of military coups and has been under the military rule of one regime or another for most of that time. Last weekend's election was only the second democratic presidential election in Nigeria the last 39 years. According to the official results, former Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo won a majority of votes throughout the country, and will be inaugurated as a civilian president on May 29. 
   Yet, Mr. President, what could have, and should have, been a proud moment in Nigeria's history was marred by significant irregularities, fraud and low voter turnout. 
   Coincidentally, election weekend was also marked by two important announcements by President Clinton: his determinations pursuant to the drug certification law and the publication of the annual State Department Human Rights Report. Under the drug law, Nigeria was identified among those countries that failed to meet the test for cooperation on anti-narcotics efforts but were granted waivers exempting them from the economic penalties imposed by the law. The administration explained this decision with respect to Nigeria by expressing hope that it would be able to work more effectively after the ``nation's transition to democracy.'' At the same time, the human rights report noted significant progress in Nigeria's human rights record, although it still acknowledged that significant problems remain. 
   Now, as Nigeria plots its course through the next stage of its multiphase transition to civilian rule, Nigerians, and we in the international community, must figure out how to react to these concurrent, though sometimes contradictory, developments. 
   Let me elaborate. The February 27 presidential elections marked the last of a series of four types of elections--local council, gubernatorial, legislative and presidential, respectively--that have taken place over the past three months according to the transition program established by General Abdusalami Abubakar. Despite some disturbing irregularities, these elections, and the campaign period preceding them, were conducted in a calm and orderly fashion, and--with the exception of a few localized incidents--without violence or physical intimidation. This process has been marked throughout by a clear demonstration of Gen. Abubakar's commitment to the transition program, including the handover of power to elected civilian authorities on May 29, and the genuine efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission 
   charged with the responsibility for conducting the elections themselves. 
   Although the turnout was much lower than expected, particularly for the presidential election, millions of Nigerians opted to participate in the process, either through voting or civic work. According to reports from domestic and international observers, the conduct of the presidential election in many places was smooth, orderly and implemented according to the established procedures. Particularly noteworthy was that the head-of-state himself, General Abubakar, was denied the  opportunity to vote because he arrived at his polling site too late to follow the required accreditation process. This adherence to proper procedures is indeed encouraging. 
   Doubly encouraging is the clear and strong wish of the overwhelming majority of Nigerians for a swift and orderly transition to democratic civilian rule. 
   Mr. President, I commend and congratulate the Nigerian people who contributed to these positive developments in the electoral process. 
   But Mr. President, these commendations and congratulations are dampened by reports of massive irregularities in this election, which can be more properly called deliberate fraud. I find these reports deeply discouraging. 
   At polling stations in several areas, particularly in what is known as the South-South zone, the turnout observed by domestic and international monitors was significantly lower than the vote totals reported at a statewide level. This suggests that there were a considerable number of ballots included in the final count that were not submitted by legitimate registered voters. Domestic and international monitors also noted that the reported collated results from a particular local government area exceeded the combined total votes from the polling stations in that area. Additionally, at some locations, voters were denied the opportunity to vote because ballots were delivered suspiciously late or in insufficient numbers. Finally, certain procedures established by the electoral commission were not consistently applied. According to the report issued by the Carter Center/National Democratic Institute Observer Delegation, these included the failure to use indelible ink at many polling stations, the failure to ensure ballot secrecy, late poll openings, and a failure to adhere to an accreditation process that was distinct from the actual voting process. 
   Reports of these malpractices are indeed disturbing. Although it remains unclear whether the fraudulent activities had an impact on the ultimate outcome of this election, such irregularities risk bringing the legitimacy of the process into question and must be condemned. 
   Indeed, former President Jimmy Carter, who led a 66-person observation delegation and spent considerable time in the country, was so disturbed by these irregularities that he sent a terse, two-sentence letter to the chairman of the 
   electoral commission. The letter said--quote--``There was a wide disparity between the number of voters observed at the polling stations and the final results that have been reported from several states. Regrettably, therefore, it is not possible for us to make an accurate judgment about the outcome of the presidential election.'' Since 1989, President Carter has led delegations to observe electoral processes in 15 countries and has rarely had such harsh words to say regarding the outcome. This assessment truly gives me pause. 
   Mr. President, in addition to the views expressed by international observers, I would also like to emphasize the importance of the views of the main domestic observer group, The Transition Monitoring Group, or TMG. The TMG is an umbrella organization formed of more than 60 human rights and civil society groups from throughout Nigeria. Together, these organizations fielded some 10,700 monitors to observe voting and counting at a large number of the country's 115,000 polling stations in all of the country's 36 states. In its interim report, the TMG noted that the kinds of malpractices observed in the elections ``have the potential to erode the confidence of the electorate in the whole transition.'' Therefore, the report recommends, and I quote:  
   It is important for the incoming civilian government to appreciate and understand that the emphasis in the current process has been on transition to civilian rule, rather than the establishment of full-blown democracy to Nigeria. Any triumphalist insistence on a ``winner-take-all'' stance on the basis of a supposed democratic mandate must be avoided. The incoming civilian government must therefore begin to make determined and sustained efforts to cultivate democratic norms and values amongst its members, as well as in the society at large.  
   Mr. President, this is a key observation. The large number of reports of deliberate fraud, combined with the low voter turnout, appear to weaken the mandate for Gen. Obasanjo. His strong mandate, however, is for the development of civilian democratic rule. The General certainly has the capacity to embrace that mandate and implement true civilian rule according to the wishes of his people. Whether he chooses to go this route or not remains to be seen. I strongly urge him to take the needed steps to allow real democracy to take root in Nigeria. He should act decisively to develop effective democratic institutions, establish appropriate decentralization of decisionmaking throughout the three levels of government, integrate the military into democratic society, and create the mechanisms of transparency and accountability that will allow the people to gain confidence that they are truly governing themselves. 
   Key to these measures, of course, will be the adoption of a broadly accepted constitution. Amazingly, the ongoing transition process has been conducted without the benefit of a constitutional framework. The current military government has said it will introduce a constitution in the near future. I hope it will be promulgated as an interim framework, and not imposed as a final document. Then I hope the president-elect will institute a democratic procedure to debate and develop a new constitution that can have popular support. 
   Mr. President, as I said at the beginning, Nigerians and we in the international community, must decide how to react to these developments. My own assessment is mixed. Therefore, I have a few words to say about the two executive branch announcements that were issued just prior to the election, the drug certification decision and the human rights report. 
   Although there was little concrete progress on important anti-narcotics efforts between the United States and Nigeria, the President decided to grant Nigeria a vital national interests certification in order to support the transition underway in Nigeria. That decision paves the way for the administration to provide needed economic and security assistance to the new civilian government in Nigeria once it is inaugurated. In this particular case, I wish the decision to waive the sanctions under this law could have waited until inauguration day actually arrives. The United States has until now had a strong sanctions regime against Nigeria, which has provided significant leverage for us in that country. Slowly, we were beginning to open up that relationship, with the loosening of visa restrictions last fall. Now, however, by appearing to bless the efforts of the current Nigerian regime on narcotics enforcement, we have removed an important source of leverage. Despite good communication between Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency and our own Drug Enforcement 
   Agency, the fact is little progress has been made in key areas. Nigerian efforts have been unsatisfactory on extradition of offenders wanted in the United States, implementation of Nigeria's own national drug strategy and related laws, stemming corruption among law enforcement personnel, and targeting Nigeria-based worldwide narcotics and money laundering organizations. 
   Mr. President, the loss of our leverage on these important issues makes me nervous. Yet I am inclined to be ``cautiously supportive'' or at least ``cautiously open-minded'' about this decision as long as the administration's plans for working with the government are moderated and deliberately paced. A cautious approach is essential so that in the event of a severe downspiral, the United States will not be overly exposed. I look forward to extensive consultation with the executive branch on such plans. 
   Mr. President, I must also note some of the observations in this year's State Department report on human rights in Nigeria. I am pleased that the report indicates substantial improvement in Nigeria's human rights record in the latter part of 1998 as compared to its previously extremely poor record. Nonetheless, despite progress in the reduction of government use of lethal force and torture, the ending of harsh suppression of a free press, and the restoration of citizens' rights to choose their government, the report acknowledges that serious human rights problems persist. 
   In particular, Nigerian security forces continue to commit  extrajudicial killings, although generally not of a political character. During frequent fuel shortages, the police and military deployed to maintain order at filling stations repeatedly killed customers and operators, according to press reports. During the month of November alone, members of the combined police and military anticrime task force known as ``Operation Sweep'' reportedly committed at least 16 extrajudicial killings. Although some improvements were made, harsh prison conditions and denial of proper medical treatment contributed to the death of inmates. While Gen. Abubakar apparently began a serious effort to release political detainees, the lack of authoritative information regarding the exact number of remaining detainees served to confirm the fact that Abacha-era security forces were able to put persons in detention with very little concern about due process or accountability. 
   In addition, several of the important military decrees, which grant the security forces sweeping powers of arrest and detention, remain on the books. 
   Given the longstanding pattern of human rights abuses and some uncertainty about how widely accepted the new civilian president will be, the report acknowledges that there is significant potential for a continued unacceptable human rights environment in Nigeria. 
   Mr. President, I have long been concerned about the human rights situation in Nigeria. I have introduced several pieces of legislation designed to encourage democratization and respect for the rule of law in that country. I desperately want to support an active and proactive U.S. policy toward the country. For now, most signals seem to indicate that the transition will continue to be smooth and peaceful. However, I am concerned that in truly wishing the best for the Nigerian people and in looking for ways to support the transition, the United States will in effect hold Nigeria's rulers to a lower standard of good governance than it traditionally has demanded. I know that the administration is anxious to work with the new government, and if all goes well, I would encourage that. 
   The conduct of the elections last weekend did not inspire much confidence in the process, and this is a great disappointment. However, it does not mean we should throw in the towel in the fight to foster a democratic Nigeria. No. In fact the opposite is true. We must continue to be vigilant and encourage Nigeria and its new leadership to follow the right path. This means the United States should continue to help Nigeria develop democratic institutions and to strengthen political and civic organizations at all levels of government. We should help the military remove itself from political life and become integrated into democratic society. But we should do this carefully and thoughtfully. And that is the best way we can help Nigeria help itself.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for the Airline Passenger Fairness Act. I commend Senators WYDEN and MCCAIN for bringing this crucial consumer issue before the Senate in a bipartisan manner. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill. 
   Mr. President, I'm sure that each and every one of us in this body has experienced his or her fair share of frustration with air travel. Whether it's late flights, bad meals, long lines, or lost luggage, we've all gotten the short end of the stick at one point or another. 
   When it comes to air travel, we are all consumers. And this bill assures the protection of consumer interests. The Airline Passenger Fairness Act would ensure that passengers have the information that they need to make informed choices in their air travel plans. Given the recent spate of airlines' customer relations debacles, I hope this bill will also encourage some of them to treat their customers with more respect. 
   Mr. President, financial statements and the stock market don't lie. Most airlines have been experiencing years of exploding growth and record profits. Unfortunately, some employees and consumers have not shared in the boom. While this bill doesn't address all consumer concerns, it does move us forward in a constructive manner. 
   Mr. President, it's probably about time air travelers' interests received our attention. According to the Department of Transportation, consumer complaints about air travel shot up by  more than 25 percent last year. Those complaints run the gamut from ephemeral ticket pricing; being sold a ticket on already oversold flights; lost luggage; and flight delays, changes, and cancellations. This bill addresses these issues and more. 
   Perhaps of more importance, this bill does so without forcing airlines to compile information that they don't already keep. The bill simply allows air travelers the right to that basic information and the ability to make informed decisions. 
   Mr. President, I am fortunate to represent and be a customer of the nation's premier airline when it comes to customer satisfaction. For years, Midwest Express Airlines has enjoyed some of the highest airline customer satisfaction ratings in the country. For those of my colleagues who haven't had the pleasure to ride on Midwest Express, I, and I'm sure I speak for the senior Senator from Wisconsin, encourage you to do so. 
   Mr. President, Midwest Express maintains those superlative ratings because it already incorporates some of the provisions spelled out in this bill. Midwest Express already tries to notify its travelers if it anticipates a flight delay, flight change, or flight cancellation. The airline already attempts to make information on oversold flights available to its customers. Midwest Express already makes efforts to allow its customers access to frequent flyer program information. 
   These are some of the reasons the airline has been awarded the Consumer Reports Travel Letter Best Airline Award every year from 1992 to 1998; Zagat Airline Survey's #1 Domestic Airline award in 1994 and 1996; Travel & Leisure's World's Best Awards for Best Domestic Airline in 1997 and 1998; and Conde Nast Traveler's Business Travel Awards for Best U.S. Airline in 1998, among many awards. 
   Mr. President, other airlines should see this bill as a challenge to meet the lofty standards set by airlines like Midwest Express. 
   Mr. President, air travel is on the rise, but so are air travel complaints. This bill responds to the complaints by giving our constituents access to the information they need to make wise choices in air travel. Airlines truly concerned about their customers should already be making these efforts. As I noted, one Wisconsin-based airline is already making the effort. I urge my colleagues to join in this effort.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues the Senior Senator from Arizona (Mr. MCCAIN) and the Senior Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) to pay tribute to Morris K. Udall. While my friends from Arizona and Massachusetts enjoyed direct personal and working relationships with Mo Udall, I never knew him. But, I believe that those members of this body who worked with Mo Udall were infected by his unwavering commitment to his colleagues and share Udall's desire to work in a bipartisan  fashion. I feel that I am a part of this legacy, and that is why I am joining in paying tribute to Udall's life. 
   Central parts of Udall's legislative agenda were his commitment to the reform of campaign financing and his commitment to environmental protection. In 1967, Udall wrote in a constituent newsletter about the perilous position in which the drive to raise money places young aspiring legislators. He argued, setting the stage for the reform of the 1970s, that ``drastic changes'' were ``needed to breathe new life into American politics and recapture our political system from the money changers.'' I am inspired by Udall's remarks, in my own work on campaign finance reform with the Senior Senator from Arizona (Mr. MCCAIN), especially when I reflect on the fact that these are neither new nor resolved problems. 
   I also share Mo Udall's great respect for America's public lands. I have been a co-sponsor of the bill to protect the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife refuge for three Congresses, and I have joined in the fight to protect the public lands of Southern Utah. Both of these campaigns date back to unfinished business that Udall began with the Alaska Lands Act and with his commitment to designating and protecting our country's special wild places. 
   In addition to conveying my own admiration for Mo Udall, I am also here to share the reflections of my own home state. Wisconsinites have a special fondness for Mo Udall for several reasons. Udall, who began his presidential quest as a long shot, a relatively unknown Arizona congressman, turned out to be a serious contender for the presidency. With his special brand of humor, Udall was a reformer who didn't come across as self-important. He outlasted bigger-name contenders and became Jimmy Carter's major rival for the nomination. 
   As a presidential candidate, Udall was unafraid to describe himself as part of a political tradition near and dear to the heart of the Badger State--progressivism. ``Liberal,'' Udall said, was just a buzzword. He didn't mind answering to it but by his standards he felt that he should more accurately be described as a ``progressive,'' in the tradition of Wisconsin's Fighting Bob LaFollette and in line with the presidencies of Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy. During the 1976 campaign, a commitment to progressivism nearly handed him Wisconsin's nod. Udall's biggest disappointment was in Wisconsin, where two networks declared him the winner and the April 7, 1976 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's front page declared: ``Carter Upset by Udall.'' After going to bed as the winner of Wisconsin, Udall woke up as the runner-up when Carter pulled it out by less than 1% of the vote. Those premature reports turned out to be as close to victory as Udall got in the Democratic primaries that year. 
   It is my understanding that following his unsuccessful campaign for President, Udall framed that Milwaukee Journal Sentinel cover and it remained hanging on the wall within arm's length of his desk in his Capitol Hill office. 
   Second, Wisconsinites truly appreciated an accomplished national legislator who could laugh at himself. That's a rarity in politics. It's also why Udall is being remembered with such respect and affection from both sides of the political aisle. It is my understanding that Udall always had a one-liner. When Udall wrote a book about his '76 campaign, he called it ``Too Funny to Be President.'' A few of Washington's more somber commentators had suggested in '76 that Udall was too witty to be taken seriously. Udall disagreed: ``I've had a lot of letters about it. People found it a very appealing characteristic. They don't like pomposity. I took problems seriously--but not myself. The humor was directed at me, at other politicians, at the political process. I thought it was a big asset. It showed some stability and sensitivity.'' 
   That book describes a 1976 campaign discussion in Wisconsin that Udall had with a 70-year old farmer in the northern part of my state. According to Udall, the farmer asked: ``Where are you from son?'' ``Washington, DC,'' Udall replied. ``You've got some pretty smart fellas back there ain't ya?,'' said the farmer. ``Yes sir, I guess we do.'' ``Got some that ain't so smart too, ain't ya?,'' the farmer continued.'' ``Well,'' Udall replied, ``I guess that's true too.'' ``Hard to tell the difference, ain't it,'' the farmer concluded with a laugh. Having traveled to every one of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year as part of my commitment to hold an annual town meeting, I share Udall's delight in this anecdote and his characterization of this truly Wisconsin exchange ``In a democracy, you see,'' Udall said, ``the people always have the last laugh.'' 
   Udall will be long remembered for his character and fundamental decency. Without him, we must all strive to put issues before party and to complete the people's business. On behalf of myself and the citizens of my state, I wish to convey our greatest sympathy to Mo Udall's family. We are a greater country for his service. I yield the floor.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with the impeachment trial now behind us, I wanted to take a moment to make a few comments about the process that we experienced and suggest some of the lessons that we learned. I hope that in the weeks and months to come, we can look back dispassionately and try to take advantage of those lessons to make some changes in the Senate's rules that might serve us well in future impeachment trials. 
   The process used in the impeachment trial in the Senate was imperfect, but this is not surprising. The only truly apposite source of precedents took place more than 130 years ago. The value of the Johnson procedural precedents has been undermined in part by the changes in our politics, our culture and our technology. 
   There are many aspects of the trial that history will undoubtedly look upon with favor. Chief Justice Rehnquist, a son of Shorewood, Wisconsin, presided fairly and with dignity. His few rulings were not challenged. Perhaps most important, he provided a steady hand with a dose of humor. We are all in his debt. 
   In addition, senators approached the trial with dignity and collegiality. At the moment of greatest tension between the advocates, good will among senators never faltered. I understand that this may, in part, be due to the fact that the ultimate outcome of this trial was never in doubt. Having said that, however, senators, really without exception, took their duties and each other seriously. The impeachment of a president is a painful process, and, as I will discuss further in a moment, it ought to be painful. The stakes were very high in this trial, yet the Senate remained a place of civility. This was in stark contrast to the impeachment process in the House of Representatives. I hope the relative harmony in the Senate restored to this process some of the legitimacy lost in the partisan din of the other body. 
   The House Managers and the President's counsel did well in their individual presentations. At the outset we senators caucused together and reached a fair, if imperfect, roadmap for the early stages of the trial. Ultimately, we agreed on a procedural course that took us through the verdict. The tone throughout was civil and the arguments, by and large, on point. 
   But we did tie the hands of the advocates in some ways, and perhaps denied ourselves the fullest possible presentation of the evidence and arguments. The trial consisted, except for the unusual, and not always helpful, question period, of opening arguments followed  by several iterations of closing arguments. These arguments were interspersed with video snippets from grand jury depositions and depositions by the House Managers. This arrangement, pieced together as we went along, did not always make for a coherent narrative. 
   The House Managers' theory of the case required us to accept a narrative, a story of conspiracy, lies and efforts to thwart justice. As they told the story, each sinister act was offered as evidence of the coherent whole. They had trouble telling a story, due partly to flaws in their theory and, to be fair, perhaps in small part due to flaws in our process. We had no live witnesses. The parties alternated control of the floor, creating a dynamic of thrust and parry, rather than a methodically constructed narrative. 
   The managers' complaints about the process in turn became a recurrent theme in their arguments, resulting in greater, and sometimes unfair, latitude for them in their efforts to make the case. For example, on a disappointing party line vote, the President was denied fair notice of the snippets of taped testimony that would be woven into the House Managers' arguments. Then the Senate allowed the House Managers to reserve two of their three hours of closing arguments for a ``rebuttal'' which included new iterations of their various accusations, with no opportunity for the defense to reply. 
   The question of witnesses was distorted on both sides by political considerations. The House Managers were counseled by their allies in the Senate not to seek too many witnesses, lest they unnerve Senators with visions of unseemly testimony on the floor. The President's defenders declared that no witnesses were necessary; they argued that the House Managers had passed up their chance to hear fact witnesses in the House Judiciary Committee hearings. Neither approach was sound--witnesses would have helped, but they should have been chosen and presented in a thoughtful way. I believe, for example, that Betty Currie was a very important potential witness. She was nowhere to be found, apparently because the managers made a political calculation that they would do without her testimony, trading away the strongest piece of their obstruction case. 
   In the end, both sides made strategic decisions in this trial at the mercy of a fluid and unpredictable procedure. That led to an element of chance in the trial that I believe was unfortunate. And it also led to complaints from each side about the fairness of the process that were a distraction from the substance of the trial. I therefore recommend to future presidential impeachment courts that at the very outset they try hard to achieve consensus on a procedure that will govern the entire trial. 
   The process was not only flawed in the procedure on the floor. In the midst of the trial, the Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, at the behest of the House Managers, sought from the District Court an order compelling Monica Lewinsky to travel to Washington to submit to a private interview with the House Managers. This interposed the court and the Independent Counsel in matters properly reserved to the Senate, in which the Constitution vests the sole power to try impeachments. In so doing, he undermined the bipartisan agreement of the Senate that it would make procedural determinations regarding witnesses following the opening arguments and the question period. 
   Both the Republican and Democratic caucuses met throughout the trial to discuss the proceedings. I attended these meetings and I do not assert that they were improper, but we could have better lived up to our oath to do impartial justice, if we had not held those regular party caucuses. Those meetings must have seemed to some of our constituents to be the place where we plotted a partisan course. This could not have helped the people to have confidence in our work. 
   Time and again, we saw the House Managers and the President's lawyers clearly responding to advice from Senators. At times they held formal meetings with Senators. There were countless casual conversations about the case between Senators and the advocates for both sides. We are not solely jurors, in the traditional sense, but as triers of fact and law, we would do well in future impeachment trials to avoid these interactions, which really amount to ex parte communications. 
   The greatest flaw in the process was the lack of openness in deliberations. The modern Senate has no excuse for locking the people out of any of its proceedings except for the most serious reasons of national security. The Chief Justice ruled forcefully that the Senate in an impeachment trial is not a jury in the ordinary sense of the word. With that ruling, any pretext for closed deliberations was destroyed. We should quickly take steps now that the trial is over to change the archaic rules that forced this process behind closed doors at crucial moments. The American people should be able to watch us and hear us at every stage in a process that could lead to removal of a President they elected. Secrecy in these proceedings is wrong and can only undermine public confidence in this important constitutional event. 
   Mr. President, impeachment trials should be extremely rare. To make this more likely, the process of impeachment in the Senate should not be quick, convenient, and painless. Making it so only invites its further abuse. Adherence to a thorough process can provide a stabilizing bulwark against this kind of abuse. That is one of the reasons I opposed premature motions to dismiss the Articles of Impeachment and supported the House Managers' motions to depose witnesses and to admit those depositions into the record. The hasty and abbreviated impeachment process of the other body helped contribute to a feeling of two armed encampments facing each other in a high stakes contest rather than a search for truth or justice. Whether a President is convicted or acquitted, no credible or politically sustainable result can possibly come from such a process. 
   I believe it is important for us to review and analyze the process by which we conducted this trial and look honestly and critically at what worked and what didn't. We should then make changes to the process, now, while the experiences of this trial are fresh in our minds, and hand down to the next Senate that faces the unfortunate task of mounting an impeachment trial rules and procedures that will help it conduct the trial in a manner worthy of the weighty constitutional duty that the Framers of the Constitution bequeathed to it.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I especially thank my friends from Arkansas and Minnesota. I am extremely proud of their leadership on this issue. Having this matter become one of the first matters we take up in this Congress is exactly the right way to go. We need to be as aggressive as we can on this issue. That is why I am cosponsoring the resolution. I strongly commend them for their leadership on this. 
   The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should initiate active lobbying at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for a resolution condemning human rights abuses in China. And it calls specifically for the United States to introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution on China and Tibet at the upcoming session of the Commission, which is due to begin next month in Geneva. 
   This resolution makes a simple, clear statement of principle: The Senate believes that there should be a China resolution in Geneva, period. 
   The Commission is a focal point for the protection of human rights, and as such, is an ideal multilateral forum in which the United States should voice its concerns. Under the pressure of previous Geneva resolutions, China has finally reacted. China signed the U.N. Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights in 1997 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in October 1998. Unfortunately, neither of these important documents has been ratified or implemented. 
   But at least the kind of pressure the United States put on this situation led them to sign these documents. 
   The effort to move a resolution in the Commission is particularly important this year, in light of the Administration's decision, contrary to the nearly unanimous sentiment of the Senate, not to sponsor such a resolution last year. That was a real disappointment for all of us. 
   Their misguided belief that progress could be achieved by other means was clearly not borne out by events in 1998, when, particularly in the last quarter, China stepped up its repression. 
   As we all know, for the past few years, China's leaders have aggressively lobbied against efforts at the Commission earlier and more actively than the countries that support a resolution. Last year, Chinese officials basically succeeded in getting the European Union Foreign Ministers to drop any European cosponsorship of a resolution. In the past, China's vigorous efforts have resulted in a ``no action'' motion at the Commission. 
   I will say, on a bright note, that in 1995 a ``no action'' motion was defeated and a resolution was almost adopted. But, unfortunately, on a downbeat note, it lost by only one vote. A little more effort could have made the difference. I sincerely hope that we do not end up with that kind of a loss at this year's meeting. 
   Nearly five years after the President's decision, which I deeply regretted, to delink most-favored-nation status from human rights, we cannot forget that the human rights situation in China and Tibet remains abysmal. While the State Department has not yet provided its most recent human rights report, I have no doubt it will be as critical of China as the 1997 report was when it noted that ``the Government of China continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in violation of internationally accepted norms, including extrajudicial killings, the use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, the sale of organs from executed prisoners, and tight control over the exercise of the rights of freedom of speech, press, and religion.'' I encourage Secretary Albright to actively raise these concerns with her counterparts during her visit to Beijing next week. Unfortunately, in the past bilateral discussions have produced only empty promises from China's leaders on the subject of human rights. Regardless of what assurances China may provide to the Secretary, we should not let Beijing's easily abandoned promises deter us from seeking international condemnation of its practices. Only through strong US leadership can we gain the broad international consensus necessary to maintain the pressure on China to demonstrate sustained progress in providing the basic human rights its people deserve. 
   Mr. President, again my thanks to these two Senators. The time is now, and the place is Geneva. We are going to keep pushing this until it gets done. 
   I thank the President, and I thank my colleagues. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning S. 4, the military pay and benefits bill. Senator WARNER, the esteemed new chairman of the Armed Service Committee, has begun what I'm sure will be a distinguished tenure by addressing an issue of critical importance. I don't know if there is a more vital resource in this nation than its men and women in uniform. 
   Without question, certain services have a recruiting and retention problem. For a variety of reasons, officers and enlisted members are leaving the Army, Navy, and Air Force in droves, and these services are having problems bringing new people on board. Serious questions remain unresolved about the cause of this problem, or its best solution, yet we will probably vote out the bill this week without those answers, and with little concern for its fiscal impact. 
   I am extremely concerned that this bill came out of the Armed Services Committee without the benefit of a single hearing and with little understanding of its effects on the budget. The rush to pass this bill is perplexing. We would normally address military pay raises, retirement reform, and the other bill provisions during consideration of the annual defense authorization bill. This course only makes more sense given the uncertainty we face regarding the budget impact of this bill. It would give the Senate ample opportunity to answer the myriad questions surrounding the bill's cost and budget implications. 
   Mr. President, there are some significant budget concerns raised by this bill. It increases both discretionary spending and entitlement costs, and all of its costs are heavily back loaded. 
   According to CBO, S. 4 increases discretionary spending by $40.8 billion over the next 10 years. In addition, the bill's costs rise each year, reaching $6.5 billion by 2009, and would continue to rise for a number of years after that. 
   The bill increases entitlement costs by $13.2 billion over the next 10 years. Again, this figure does not fully reflect the eventual price tag as costs rise over time. CBO estimates that when the provisions of S. 4 are fully phased in, the entitlement costs for pensions would result in increased costs of $5 billion a year. Similarly, the additional costs for so-called readjustment benefits, essentially education benefits, would rise, and by 2009 would increase by $2.5 billion per year. 
   According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, when fully in effect, the bill as a whole would cost at least $15 billion per year, and possibly more. Most notably, none, let me repeat that, Mr. President, none of this is offset. 
   Due to these effects on the budget, the bill is subject to not one, but three 60-vote points of order: (1) It exceeds the Armed Services Committee's allocation for entitlement spending for fiscal years 1999 through fiscal year 2003; (2) It breaches the revenue floor by decreasing income tax revenues from the Thrift Savings Program provision; and (3) It has PAYGO problems because none of the new mandatory spending and tax revenue losses are offset. 
   Mr. President, strictly from a budget point of view, regardless of the pay and pension policies in the bill, this can be fairly characterized as a budget buster. An eventual cost of $15 billion per year is large, and at the very least should be considered as part of an overall budget, not rushed through before we have passed a budget resolution. 
   There are other concerns, Mr. President. The biggest question is whether this bill will actually improve recruitment and retention. Just this week, the General Accounting Office offered preliminary data on a study showing that money has been overstated as a factor affecting decisions to stay in or leave the military. Instead, GAO found, in a survey of more than 700 service members, that issues like a lack of spare parts; concerns with the health care system; increased deployments; and dissatisfaction with military leaders have at least as much effect on retention, if not more, than money. GAO is expected to finish the report in June. 
   Not only that. The Defense Department and the Congressional Budget Office are expected to have their own reports in the coming weeks and months. Why not wait until then? Let's make sure we're doing the right things to maintain the world's best armed forces. 
   Mr. President, I'd like to address some specific provisions in the bill. As we are all now well aware, the military pension system was changed in 1986. At the time, many, including those in President Reagan's Defense Department, argued that the pension system encouraged many of our servicemembers to leave the services early. They had the benefit of several years of study and hearings to reach that conclusion. 
   My late colleague from Wisconsin, the former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, devoted much of his career to shaping the world's best and most feared military. At the time we changed the military pension system, he voiced considerable concern that the pension benefits were so generous to those with 20 years of service, and still at a relatively young age, that they provided incentive to leave for the private sector, rather than stay in the service. 
   Our former Armed Services Committee Chairman, Sam Nunn, stated that ``returning to the old system would reduce--not strengthen--the willingness of personnel to remain in the service.'' That is a heady statement from a colleague whose judgment on defense issues is still widely respected by those serving in this body today. 
   Just back in October, then-Chairman THURMOND and Senator LEVIN, the committee's ranking member, proclaimed that any change to the pension system should be subject to ``careful analysis.'' As yet, I haven't seen one. And I would like to see that careful analysis before moving forward with this bill. 
   I have heard from the men and women out on the front lines. According to what I've heard, they are leaving because of ever-increasing deployments to uncertain destinations, ever-widening time away from their families, and dwindling advancement opportunities. Like anyone else, they want to see a better quality of life. 
   I won't disagree with the view that many servicemembers need a raise. And I firmly believe that they should receive one, especially the enlisted folks, many of whom could be getting more money by flipping burgers at the closest fast food joint. These men and women have chosen to represent our country. They deserve to be paid adequately. 
   Ultimately, though, Mr. President, too many questions about this bill remain unanswered. I, and I hope many of my colleagues, would like to know how this bill will affect our budget now and in the future. We just extricated ourselves from a budget quagmire. Shouldn't we have all the answers about a bill that will cost $55 billion over the next 10 years before we vote on it? I just seems like common sense  to me. If we were to find that this bill won't harm Social Security and other important programs, and it will actually improve recruitment and retention, I would support it fully. Short of those answers, I cannot support putting our nation's budget on the precipice of disaster. 
   Mr. President, we have time this year to hold hearings; to hear from officers and enlisted men and women; to hear from service chiefs; to receive expert studies. There is no reason to rush this important legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer S. Res. 54 with regard to the escalating violence, the gross violation of human rights and attacks against civilians in the West African country of Sierra Leone. I am joined in this effort by my colleagues, Senators FRIST, BIDEN, JEFFORDS, WELLSTONE, and FEINSTEIN. 
   This resolution expresses in the strongest terms the condemnation of the ongoing atrocities committed by rebel forces in Sierra Leone, including forced amputations, the rape of women and children, the pillaging of farms, and the murder of unarmed civilians. It urges all parties in the brutal violence to cease hostilities and engage in a dialogue to bring about a lasting solution that will support the people of Sierra Leone in their quest for a democratic, prosperous, and reconciled society. It further calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to give high priority to solving the conflict and supporting United Nations efforts to monitor respect for human rights and humanitarian law by all parties to this deplorable situation. 
   Mr. President, since it gained independence in 1961, Sierra Leone has endured a series of military regimes and rebellions in struggles over economic and political power. However, the latest round of violence is unique in the scale and brutality of the attacks On innocent civilians. Let me provide a little history to help set the stage for the current human tragedy faced by the people of Sierra Leone. In May 1997, a group of military officers, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) seized power. During their nine month tenure, the AFRC joined forces with the armed rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) to form a regime characterized by serious human rights abuses and a complete breakdown of the rule of law. In response to this situation, in February 1998 the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), a Nigerian-led African peacekeeping force that helped restore stability to neighboring Liberia, forced the AFRC/RUF out of power, restoring President Ahmad Kabbah, who had been elected in March 1996 in Sierra Leone's first multi-party elections in almost three decades. Since their ouster, the AFRC/RUF forces have waged an increasingly vicious struggle against the weak Kabbah government. The situation is further complicated by the apparent participation by neighboring governments, Liberia and Burkina Faso, in supporting the rebel forces. Libya, too, has been identified as providing support to the rebels. 
   In recognition of the unacceptable state of human rights and the massive humanitarian crisis brought on by the civil war, the United Nations took action in July 1998, when the Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) for an initial period of six months, until January 1999. UNOMSIL, formed of up to 70 military observers and a small medical unit, was tasked with monitoring the military and security situation in the country, including the disarmament and demobilization of former combatants, and the adherence to international humanitarian law. Unfortunately, a rebel assault on the capital in January forced the evacuation of UNOMSIL to neighboring Guinea. 
   Mr. President, it is difficult for most of us to comprehend the extent and the brutality of the human crisis in Sierra Leone. The United Nations has estimated that over 400,000 Sierra Leoneans have fled the fighting, either as refugees to neighboring Guinea and Liberia or to camps for the internally displaced. Conditions for both internally displaced persons and refugees are often severe due to a lack of access to camps and poor security conditions. 
   Mr. President, words cannot adequately describe the horrors that have been waged by the AFRC/RUF forces, which have included some of the most heinous acts ever committed in wartime. Human Rights Watch estimates that thousands of Sierra Leonean civilians have been raped, deliberately mutilated (often by amputation), or killed outright by the AFRC/RUF. In February 1998, these rebel groups launched two loosely organized campaigns of terror, ``Operation No Living Thing'' and ``Operation Pay Yourself,'' designed to loot, destroy, or kill anything in the path of the combatants. During these campaigns, rebel fighters were encouraged to actively target women and commit sexual violence, including rape. Children, too, have not been spared from the gross violations of human rights committed by both sides to the conflict. The AFRC/RUF has abducted as many as 2,500 children--probably in the thousands--for use as laborers, fighters, and in the case of girls, sexual prisoners. They have abducted many children, some as young as eight or ten years old, and turned them into some of the rebels' fiercest fighters. 
   In December, the Chairman of the UN Security Council's Sierra Leone Sanctions Committee stated that it was hard to find words strong enough to describe the atrocities committed by the  rebels. He cited instances where AFRC/RUF forces have cut off body parts with large machetes or burned civilians alive. He estimated that more than 4,000 people had been summarily executed or mutilated, just since April. Given the restrictions on access to a significant portion of the country, these numbers are likely just the tip of the iceberg. 
   The scope of the catastrophe is overwhelming, yet it is even more heart rending when viewed through the lens of the stories of individual experiences. International human rights groups have interviewed hundreds of survivors of the violence, each with a tale of suffering that is incomprehensible to many Americans. One woman described how she was captured, cut with a machete by a child rebel, had her hand amputated, and was left to bury her own hand. A reporter for the ``Herald Guardian'' reported seeing rebels cut off the foot of a boy and then execute him, with the final words of ``You're too tall.'' Another woman recounted being captured, beaten, raped, and having the backs of her ankles sliced just below the Achilles tendon to ensure that she could not run away. Hundreds of Sierra Leoneans, who have swelled the refugees ranks in border camps in Guinea and Liberia, have similar stories. 
   Mr. President, although the bulk of the condemnation must go to the rebel forces of the AFRC and the RUF, the Kabbah government is itself no paragon of liberty and the rule of law. In particular, the Kamajor civilian defense forces affiliated with the Kabbah regime have been cited for indiscriminate killings and torture. Many of the 
   more than 2,000 prisoners in Sierra Leone have been held under the 1998 Public Emergency Regulations, which provide for indefinite detention without trial. Section 13 of the same Public Emergency Regulations even declares that ``disturbing reports'' by the media are punishable offenses. Further exacerbating human rights abuses, government prisons are often overcrowded, unsanitary, and lacking in health care and the regular provision of food. 
   In other examples, the High Court of Sierra Leone sentenced to death twenty-seven civilians convicted of treason, including five journalists and a seventy-five-year-old woman. International observers questioned the appropriateness of the treason charges for the journalists, and criticized the lack of a right to appeals in sentencing by the military court. In October, the government of Sierra Leone executed by firing squad, without benefit of an appeal process, twenty-four soldiers. 
   Unfortunately even elements of the otherwise admirable ECOMOG forces must also shoulder some of the responsibility for the devastation that wracks Sierra Leone. According to international humanitarian groups, shelling by ECOMOG during its assault on Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital, in February 1998, took a high toll on civilians. Its forces have also obstructed humanitarian assistance and some members may seek to prolong their mission in order to exploit the conflict for economic gain. 
   Mr. President, it is unconscionable to allow this situation to continue without exerting every effort to help resolve the conflict that generates such atrocities. While no other country or international organization can impose a settlement on Sierra Leone, it is incumbent upon us to offer our assistance in ending the catastrophic violence. We must call on the combatants to come to the negotiating table, and on neighboring governments to cease their support for the rebel forces that have prolonged Sierra Leone's political and humanitarian agony. We should be prepared to support such a process through provision of additional logistical support to the regional peacekeeping force and through encouragement of a renewed commitment for UNOMSIL to carry out its mandate. To provide for a long term solution, we must also actively support multinational humanitarian operations to address the wide-ranging needs of a displaced and brutalized population. But even if the humanitarian disaster can be stemmed, we must not walk away until there is the prospect of a government that adheres to the rule of law and supports the universally recognized standards of human rights. 
   Mr. President, it does not please me to have to introduce this kind of resolution here in the Senate. But I believe it is important for the Senate to be on record in strong condemnation of the atrocities currently raging in Sierra Leone. I hope we can all move quickly to pass this resolution through the Committee on Foreign Relations and through the full Senate.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the subject of the Meat Labeling Act of 1999. This measure, introduced earlier this year by South Dakota Senator, TIM JOHNSON, would require the country-of-origin labeling of beef, lamb, and pork prior to their sale at a retail level in the United States. 
   This bill will protect the consumers--who right now have no way of telling what country their meat is coming from--and come to the aid of an industry which has had to face severe competition from foreign countries in recent years. 
   Mr. President, last year, the U.S. agriculture industry faced devastating losses. Bad weather, pest infestation, decreased demand stemming from the Asian financial crisis, and increased imports, especially from Canada, all contributed to the record low prices in nearly every sector. 
   In Wisconsin, the hog industry took a big hit as cash prices dropped an average of 55%. Incomes were slashed, farms were sold for pennies on the dollar, and over 600 producers left the business. 
   This year, the Asian crisis continues, as well as the financial problems in Russia, in Brazil and other countries. The truth is that the market for U.S. agriculture products is bleak and it does not appear to be changing anytime soon. 
   America's meat producers face not only tough global competition from abroad, but a big disadvantage here at home, because their products aren't marked ``made in the USA.'' 
   That means consumers can't distinguish a U.S.-grown pork chop from a Mexican one. This raises health and safety concerns, since meat-handling standards in other countries may not be as stringent as our own, and it means that consumers can't choose to put their buying power behind American farmers in the check-out aisle. 
   Right now the only guidance consumers do have is misleading at best--since many of us would assume that a steak that carries a USDA inspection and grade label is U.S. produced. But in many cases, this couldn't be farther from the truth. That steak could be from Mexico, Canada, or Nicaragua. And for a variety of reasons, I think Wisconsinites want to know if the pork chop they are buying is from Marquette or Mexico. 
   Recent scares over food imported from foreign countries make this issue more important than ever to consumers. Cases of disease and numerous  problems with the quality of some foreign products make it all the more vital that we provide our consumers with as much information as possible so that they may make informed decisions about the food they purchase for themselves and their families. 
   Mr. President, this measure is supported by the Administration and prominent agriculture groups like the National Farmers Union, the American Farm Bureau, and the National Cattlemen's Association to name a few. Most importantly, this measure is supported by American consumers. In January, a survey conducted by Wirthlin Worldwide showed an overwhelming percentage of Americans, 78%, want to know more about the origin of the meat they purchase. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important measure. I urge you to give your constituents the right to know more about the origin of the food they buy and to allow them the opportunity to make choices that support their nation's agriculture industry.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that will restore a measure of pay equity for our nation's Guardsmen and Reservists. The men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves are cornerstones of our national defense and domestic infrastructure and deserve more than a pat on the back. 
   Mr. President, as I'm certain my colleagues are well aware, the Guard and Reserve are integral parts of overseas missions, including recent and on-going missions to Iraq and Bosnia. According to statements by DoD officials, guardsmen and reservists will continue to play an increasingly important role in national defense strategy. The National Guard and Reserves deserve the full support they need to carry out their duties. 
   National Guard and Reserve members are increasingly relied upon to shoulder more of the burden of military operations. We need to compensate our citizen-soldiers for this increasing reliance on the Reserve forces. Mr. President, this boils down to an issue of fairness. 
   Mr. President, my amendment would correct special duty assignment pay inequities between the Reserve components of our armed forces and their active duty counterparts. These inequities should be corrected to take into account the National Guard and Reserves' increased role in our national security, especially on the front lines. Given the increased use of the Reserve components and DoD's increased reliance on them, Reservists deserve fair pay. My amendment provides that a Reservist who is entitled to basic pay and is performing special duty be paid special duty assignment pay. 
   Mr. President, right now, Reservists are getting shortchanged despite the vital role they play in our national defense. The special duty assignment pay program ensures readiness by compensating specific soldiers who are assigned to duty positions that demand special training and extraordinary effort to maintain a level of satisfactory performance. The program, as it stands now, effectively reduces the ability of the National Guard and Reserve to retain highly dedicated and specialized soldiers. 
   The special duty assignment pay program provides an additional monthly financial incentive paid to enlisted soldiers and airmen who are required to perform extremely demanding duties that require an unusual degree of responsibility. These special duty assignments include certain command sergeants major, guidance counselors, retention non-commissioned officers (NCO's), drill sergeants, and members of the Special Forces. These soldiers, however, do not receive special duty assignment pay while in an IDT status (drill weekends). 
   Between fiscal years 1998 and 1999, spending for the program was cut by $1.6 million, which has placed a fiscal restraint on the number of personnel the Army National Guard is able to provide for under this program. These soldiers deserve better. 
   Mr. President, these differences in pay and benefits are particularly disturbing since National Guard and Reserve members give up their civilian salaries during the time they are called up or volunteer for active duty. 
   As I'm sure all my colleagues have heard, the President will propose an enormous boost in defense spending over the next six years; an increase of $12 billion for fiscal year 2000 and about $110 billion over the next six years. I have tremendous reservations about spending hikes of this magnitude, but have no such reservations about supporting this nation's citizen-soldiers in this small but important way. The National Guard and Reserve deserve pay and benefit equity and that means paying them what they're worth. 
   Mr. President, according to the National Guard, shortfalls in the operations and maintenance account compromise the Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and end strength. Failing to fully support these vital areas will have both direct and indirect effects. The shortfall puts the Guard's personnel, schools, training, full-time support, and retention and recruitment at risk. Perhaps more importantly, however, it erodes the morale of our citizen-soldiers. 
   Over these past years, the Administration has increasingly called on the Guard and Reserves to handle wider-ranging tasks, while simultaneously offering defense budgets with shortfalls of hundreds of millions of dollars. These shortfalls have increasingly greater effect given the guard and reserves' increased operations burdens. This is a result of new missions, increased deployments, and training requirements. 
   Earlier this year, Charles Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs, presented DoD's position with regard to the department's working relationship with the National Guard and Reserve. He stated that all branches of the military reserves will be called upon more frequently as the nation pares back the number of soldiers on active duty. This has clearly been DoD's policy for the past few years, but Mr. Cragin went a little further by stating that the reserve units can no longer be considered ``weekend warriors'' but primary components of national defense. 
   Mr. President, in the past, DoD viewed the armed forces as a two-pronged system, with active-duty troops being the primary prong, reinforced by the Reserve component. That strategy has changed with the downsizing of active forces. Defense officials now see reserves as part of the ``total force'' of the military. 
   The National Guard and Reserves will be called more frequently to active duty for domestic support roles and abroad in various peace-keeping efforts. They will also be vital players on special teams trained to deal with weapons of mass destruction deployed within our own borders. According to many military experts, this represents a more salient threat to the United States than the threat of a ballistic missile attack that many of my colleagues have spent so much time addressing. 
   Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to see some of these soldiers off as they embarked on these missions and have welcomed them home upon their return, and I have been struck by  the courage and professionalism they display. Guardsmen and Reservists have been vital on overseas missions, and here at home. In Wisconsin, the State Guard provides vital support during state emergencies, including floods, ice storms, and train derailments. 
   Mr. President, we have a duty to honor the service of our National Guardsmen and Reservists. One way to do that is to equitably compensate them for their service. I hope my colleagues agree that our citizen-soldiers serve an invaluable role in our national defense, and their paychecks should reflect their contribution. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, like many others, the day the President wagged his finger at the American people and indicated he had not been involved with Ms. Lewinsky, I had the sense that he wasn't telling the truth and I felt some genuine regret. The President and I began here in Washington in the same month, in 1993. I had high hopes and actually felt very close to what he was trying to accomplish. So all along in this process, I have had to fight an urge to personalize that regret in a way that would affect my ability to do my job in this impeachment trial. And I will tell you that taking that separate oath helped me get into the mindset necessary to do that task. 
   But let me say that I do regret that the President's public conduct--not his private conduct--has brought us to this day. 
   But we are here, and I want to take a minute to praise my colleagues on the process. I think it would have been unfortunate had we not had any witness testimony--at least in the form of deposition testimony. I think it would have been an unfortunate historical precedent. I found the video testimony helpful. I didn't enjoy it, but I found it helpful in clarifying some of the things that I was thinking about. So I am glad, on balance, that we did not dismiss the case at the time it was first suggested. 
   But as we get to the final stage and get immersed in the law and facts of this case, it is too easy to forget the most salient fact about this entire matter, and that is one simple fact that many others have mentioned: In November 1996, 47 million Americans voted to reelect President Clinton. The people hired him. They are the hiring authority. An impeachment is a radical undoing of that authority. The people hire and somehow, under this process, the Congress can fire. So, I caution against, with all due respect to the excellent arguments made, the attempt to analogize this to an employee-employer relationship, or a military situation, or even the situation of judges--those situations are all clearly different. Along with the choice of the Vice President, in no other case, do the American people choose one person, and in no other case can a completely different authority undo that choice. 
   Having said that, the Presidential conduct in this case, in my view, does come perilously close to justifying that extreme remedy. There really have been three Presidential impeachments in our Nation's history. I see this one as being in the middle. The Andrew Johnson case is usually considered by historians to have been a relatively weak case. President Johnson had a different interpretation of the constitutionality of the statute that he believed allowed him to remove the Secretary of War, Mr. Stanton. He was not convicted, and subsequently the U.S. Supreme Court, I believe, ruled that in fact that was constitutional. I see that as having been a relatively weak case. 
   The case of Richard Nixon, in my view, was a pretty strong case, involving a 1972 Presidential election and attempts to get involved with the aspects of that election--frankly--an attempt to cover up what happened during that 1972 election. I think that had more to do with core meaning of ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' 
   This is a closer case; this is a close case. In that sense, it may be the most important of the three Presidential impeachments, in terms of the law of impeachment, as we go into the future. I agree neither with the House managers who say their evidence is ``overwhelming,'' nor with the President's counsel who says the evidence against the President is ``nonexistent.'' The fact is, this is a hard case, and sometimes they say that hard cases make bad law. But we cannot afford to have this be bad law for the Nation's sake. 
   So how do we decide? There have been a lot of helpful suggestions, but one thing that has been important to me is the way the House presented their case. That doesn't bind us, but they did suggest that two Federal statutes had been violated. Mr. Manager MCCOLLUM said that, ``You must first determine if a Federal crime has occurred.'' Many others have said that. I will reiterate a point. If that is the approach you want to take, then it is clear, in my view as one Senator, that you must prove that beyond a reasonable doubt. Otherwise, you are using the power and the opprobrium of the Federal criminal law as a sword but refusing to let the President and the defense counsel have the shield of the burden of proof that is required in the criminal law. 
   I do not have time to discuss the perjury count this afternoon, but will do so in a longer presentation for the RECORD. Suffice it to say I do not believe the managers have met their burden of proving perjury beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   As to obstruction of justice, the President did come perilously close. Three quick observations make me conclude that, in fact, he did not commit obstruction of justice beyond a reasonable doubt. First, I am very concerned about the conversations between the President and Betty Currie concerning the specifics of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. But the critical question there is intent. Was his intent about avoiding discovery by his family and the political problems involved? Or was the core issue trying to avoid the Jones proceeding and the consequences of that? 
   I don't think it has been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the Jones proceeding was the President's concern. Perhaps Ms. Currie could have shed some light on this. That is why I was extremely puzzled when the House managers didn't call Betty Currie. Let me be the first to say that I don't think in this instance the House managers ``wanted to win too badly.'' I don't think they wanted to win badly enough to take the chance of calling Betty Currie, a crucial witness. 
   I was very concerned about the false affidavit until I saw Ms. Lewinsky's Senate deposition testimony. I am persuaded that you cannot say beyond a  reasonable doubt that she was urged by the President to make a false statement in that affidavit. 
   Finally, I was very concerned about the hiding of the gifts. And maybe every one will disagree with me on this. But when I watched her testimony, I thought Ms. Lewinsky was the most indefinite about whether or not she had gotten that call from Ms. Currie than any other part of her testimony. I happen to believe that Ms. Lewinsky was the one who was the most concerned about the gifts. And I believe a showing beyond a reasonable doubt has not been made that the President masterminded the hiding of the gifts. 
   So I cannot deny what Representative GRAHAM said: If you call somebody up at 2:30 in the morning you are probably up to no good. But if you call somebody up at 2:30 in the morning you have not necessarily accomplished the crime of obstruction of justice. 
   I realize there is a separate question of whether these same acts by the President, apart from the Federal criminal law, constitute high crimes and misdemeanors. I do not. I will discuss that in more detail in a future statement in the RECORD. 
   But I would like to conclude by just talking a little bit about this impeachment issue in the modern context. When I say that the vote in 1996 is the primary issue, I don't just mean that in terms of the rights of people. I mean it in terms of the goal of the Founding Fathers, and our goal today; that is, political stability in this country. We don't want a parliamentary system. And we don't want an overly partisan system. 
   I see the 4-year term as a unifying force of our Nation. Yet, this is the second time in my adult lifetime that we have had serious impeachment proceedings, and I am only 45 years old. This only occurred once in the entire 200 years prior to this time. Is this a fluke? Is it that we just happened to have had two ``bad men'' as Presidents? I doubt it. How will we feel if sometime in the next 10 years a third impeachment proceeding occurs in this country so we will have had three within 40 years? 
   I see a danger in this in an increasingly diverse country. I see a danger in this in an increasingly divided country. And I see a danger in this when the final argument of the House manager is that this is a chapter in an ongoing ``culture war'' in this Nation. That troubles me. I hope that is not where we are and hope that is not where we are heading. 
   It is best not to err at all in this case. But if we must err, let us err on the side of avoiding these divisions, and let us err on the side of respecting the will of the people. 
   Let me conclude by quoting James W. Grimes, one of the seven Republican Senators who voted not to acquit Andrew Johnson. I discovered this speech, and found out that the Chief Justice had already discovered and quoted him, and said he was one of the three of the ablest of the seven. Grimes said this in his opinion about why he wouldn't convict President Johnson:  
   I cannot agree to destroy the harmonious working of the Constitution for the sake of getting rid of an unacceptable President. Whatever may be my opinion of the incumbent, I cannot consent to trifle with the high office he holds. I can do nothing which, by implication, may be construed as an approval of impeachment as a part of future political machinery.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of S. Res. 45 with regard to human rights in China. 
   The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should initiate active lobbying at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for a resolution condemning human rights abuses in China. It calls specifically for the United States to introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution on China and Tibet at the upcoming session of the Commission, which is due to begin in March in Geneva. 
   This resolution makes a simple, clear statement of principle: The Senate believes that there should be a China resolution in Geneva, period. 
   Mr. President, the Commission on Human Rights first met in 1947, spending its first year drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Over the next two decades, the Commission was responsible for drafting an impressive body of international human rights law and set the global standards for human rights. In the 1990s, the Commission has increasingly turned its attention to assisting states in overcoming obstacles to securing human rights for their citizens. It has been a focal point for protection of human rights for vulnerable groups in society, and as such, the Commission serves as an ideal multilateral forum for a resolution and debate on China's human rights practices. 
   The effort to move a resolution is particularly important this year, in light of the Administration's decision, contrary to the nearly unanimous sentiment of the Senate, not to sponsor such a resolution last year. Their misguided belief that progress could be achieved by other means was clearly not borne out by events in 1998, when, particularly in the last quarter, China stepped up its repression. 
   As we all know, for the past few years, China's leaders have aggressively lobbied against efforts at the Commission earlier and more actively than the countries that support a resolution. Last year, Chinese officials basically succeeded in getting the European Union Foreign Ministers to drop any European cosponsorship of a resolution. In the past, China's vigorous efforts have resulted in a ``no action'' motion at the Commission, however, in 1995 a ``no action'' motion was defeated and a resolution almost adopted, losing by only one vote. I sincerely hope we will not have the same results again at this year's meeting. 
   It is essential to have a resolution on China under the auspices of the Commission on Human Rights. The multilateral nature of the Commission makes it a very appropriate forum to debate and discuss the human rights situation in China. The Commission's review has led to proven and concrete progress on human rights in other countries, and the expectation is that such scrutiny could also lead to progress on human rights in China. Under the pressure of previous Geneva 
    resolutions, China signed in 1997 the UN Covenant of Social, Economic and Cultural Rights and in October 1998 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Neither has yet been ratified or implemented. 
   Nearly five years after the President's decision, which I deeply regretted, to delink most-favored-nation status from human rights, we cannot forget that the human rights situation in China and Tibet remains abysmal. While the State Department has not yet provided its most recent human rights report, I have no doubt it will be as critical of China as the 1997 report was when it noted that ``the Government of China continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in violation of internationally accepted norms, including extrajudicial killings, the use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, the sale of organs from executed prisoners, and tight control over the exercise of the rights of freedom of speech, press, and religion.'' 
   According to testimony to Congress by Amnesty International, the human rights situation in China shows no fundamental change, despite the recent promises from the government of China. At least 2,000 people remain in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes that are no longer even on the books in China. At least 200 individuals detained or arrested for Tiananmen Square activities nearly a decade ago are also still in prison. By China's own statistics, there are nearly a quarter of a million people imprisoned under the ``re-education through labor'' system. One of these, Yang Qinheng, received a three year term in March after he was arrested for reading an open letter on Radio Free Asia citing workers' right to unionize. 
   The litany of specific violations of human rights also has continued unabated in the last several months. Attempts to register the fledgling opposition China Democratic Party resulted in at least six arrests of opposition political leaders. In December, Wang Youcai, a student leader during Tiananmen Square protests, Xu Wenli, and Qin Yongmin were each sentenced to over 10 years in prison allegedly for ``attempting to overthrow state power'' because of their roles in the Democratic Party. 
   China took great strides to keep overseas dissidents out of China. In April, less than an hour after her arrival at her parents home, Li Xiaorong, a research scholar at University of Maryland, who was traveling on a US passport with a valid visa, was taken into custody. Her crime, according to police, was that her work in the US on behalf of human rights in China was unacceptable. Similarly, in October, Shi Binhai, a journalist at the state-run China Economic Times and co-editor of a book on political reform was indicted for collusion with overseas dissident organizations. As recently as February 4, Wang Ce was sentenced to four years in prison for illegally reentering China and providing financial support to the banned Democratic Party. 
   Demonstrating that the range of potential crimes has moved into the computer era, this year in late January, Lin Hai received the distinction of being sentenced to two years in prison for providing e-mail addresses to an Internet pro-democracy magazine. These are but a few of the many detentions, arrests, and assignments to 
    forced labor that befell individuals for expressing their views since the President's human rights dialogue at the June 1998 summit in Beijing. 
   Mr. President, the situation is just as bad in Tibet, where, according to Human Rights Watch, at least ten prisoners reportedly died following two protests in a prison in the Tibetan capital in May. In the weeks following, scores of prisoners were interrogated, beaten and placed in solitary confinement. Other deaths in prison reportedly occurred in June, with Chinese authorities claiming that many were suicides. Further, during the 1998, Chinese officials continued the ``patriotic education campaign''' designed to force Tibetans, especially Buddist monks and nuns, to denounce the Dalai Lama and to attest that Tibet has always been a part of China. As a result of the campaign, authorities reported that 76 percent of Tibetan monasteries and nunneries had been ``rectified''. 
   In a December speech Secretary Albright said, ``As we look ahead to the new century, we can expect that, perhaps, the greatest test of democracy, human rights and the rule of law will be in China.'' If the Administration believes this, perhaps it should use the time left in this century to take positive steps to encourage international condemnation of China's human rights practices. 
   In January, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Harold Koh held a bilateral human rights dialogue with the Chinese, the first such discussions in four years, and notified them of the possibility that the United States would sponsor a resolution in Geneva. In testimony to Congress following these discussions, he further promised that  ``The Administration supports the Geneva process, and intends to participate vigorously in this year's Commission activities.'' I was encouraged to hear these words and I hope they will translate into determination by the Administration actively to pursue this issue, in this forum, this year. 
   I urge the Administration to make a decision to sponsor a resolution and to begin high level lobbying of governments around the world to support a resolution before Secretary of State Albright travels to Beijing on March 1 and 2. 
   Mr. President, the situation in China indeed remains troubling. The United States has a moral responsibility to take the lead in sponsoring and pushing for a resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. I believe that there is a strong bipartisan consensus in the Foreign Relations Committee--and I predict on the floor--that we must send a message to China and that this is the appropriate time and place in which to do it. 
   I strongly commend my friends, the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Minnesota, for their leadership on this terribly important issue.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on January 28, I was the only Democratic senator to cross party lines and oppose the motion to dismiss. I felt it would be unwise to end this trial prior to a more complete presentation of evidence and a final vote on the Articles of Impeachment themselves. Nonetheless, I had no doubt that a motion to dismiss was a constitutional way to end the trial, if a majority of senators had supported the motion. 
   The Senate must keep in mind at every step in this process that our actions will be scrutinized not just by our constituents today and for the rest of the trial, but also by history. If another impeachment trial should occur 130 years from now, the record of this trial will serve as an important precedent for the Senate as it determines how to proceed. It is our responsibility to abide by the Constitution as closely as possible throughout the remainder of this trial. My votes on House Managers' motions on February 4 were based on the same concerns about prudence and precedent that motivated my earlier votes on the motion to dismiss and calling witnesses. 
   With the judgment of history awaiting us, I did have serious concerns about the constitutionality of proposals that the Senate should adopt so-called ``Findings of Fact'' before the Senate votes on the Articles of Impeachment themselves. It now appears that support for such proposals has waned, and the Senate will not be called upon to vote on them. Nonetheless, I want to explain my opposition to such proposals for the record. 
   Findings of Fact would allow a simple 51 vote majority of the Senate to state the judgment of the Senate on the facts of this case and, in effect, to determine the President's ``guilt'' of the crimes alleged in the Articles. But the Constitution specifically requires that two-thirds of the Senate must convict the President on the Articles in order to impose any sanction on him. The specific punishment set out by the Constitution if the Senate convicts is removal from office, and possibly disqualification from holding future office. 
   The supermajority requirement makes the impeachment process difficult, and the Framers intended that it be difficult. They were very careful to avoid making conviction and removal of the President something that could be accomplished for purely partisan purposes. In only 23 out of 105 Congresses and in only six Congresses in this century has one party held more than a 2/3 majority in the Senate. Never in our history has a President faced a Senate controlled by the other party by more than a 2/3 majority. (The Republican party had nearly 80 percent of the seats in the Senate that in 1868 tried Andrew Johnson. Johnson was at that time also a Republican, although he had been a Democrat before being chosen by Abraham Lincoln to be his Vice-President in 1864.) The great difficulty of obtaining a conviction in the Senate on charges that are seen as motivated by partisan politics has discouraged impeachment efforts in the past. Adding Findings of Fact to the process would undercut this salutary effect of the supermajority requirement for conviction. 
   The Senate must fulfill its constitutional obligation and determine whether the President's acts require conviction and removal. The critical constitutional tool of impeachment should not be available simply to attack or criticize the President. Impeachment is a unique. It is the sole constitutionally sanctioned encroachment on the principle of separation of powers, and it must be used sparingly. If Findings of Fact had been adopted in this trial, it would have set a dangerous precedent that might have led to more frequent efforts to impeach. 
   The ability of a simple majority of the Senate to determine the President's guilt of the crimes alleged would distort the impeachment process and increase the specter of partisanship. When the Senate is sitting as a court of impeachment, its job is simply to acquit or convict. And that is the only judgment that the Senate should make during an impeachment trial.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened by the death of King Hussein this past weekend. I have had the honor of meeting King Hussein several times, and have always been impressed by his dignity and grace. He was a true statesman. 
   Mr. President, through almost half a century of war and hope, tragedy and peace, King Hussein shepherded his country through its transition to a stable modern nation and a close U.S. ally. More than the words he has spoken, it is the actions he has taken that have earned him the respect of Israelis, and the trust of the Arab world. Throughout it all, King Hussein never lost sight of our common goal of a just and comprehensive Middle East peace, nor of what that peace would mean. He understood, even when no one else did, that true peace ``resides ultimately not in the hands of governments, but in the hands of people.'' 
   On a personal note, I remember being moved by the words he shared during the funeral of another great leader, Yitzhak Rabin. There, on the hill above the troubled city of Jerusalem, a city where as a young boy the King had witnessed the assassination of his own grandfather, and in sight of the grave of Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, King Hussein bore witness to his never-ending commitment to peace ``for all times to come,'' and pledged to do his ``utmost to ensure that we leave a similar legacy.'' And he mourned the loss of Rabin as a brother and a friend. 
   I also recall with deep admiration being in the company of the King as he looked out at the Old City from the King David Hotel at the time of that funeral. It was perhaps the first time in many decades he had visited that place, and it was a moving moment. 
   King Hussein understood well that the religious and cultural roots of the Jewish and Muslim people are forever intertwined in the fertile and historic soil of the Middle East. His country was created along the Jordan River, after which it is named, following the First World War. Its original borders on the east bank of the river, created by colonial rulers, have been altered by annexation, war, and peace agreement. Two years after Jordan gained its independence from Great Britain, the fledgling State of Israel emerged on the other side of the Jordan River, and many of the Palestinians living in the new state migrated to Jordan. 
   King Hussein's grandfather, King Abdullah, was the first ruler of an independent Jordan. His decision to annex the Palestinian-held West Bank in 1950, when his grandson was 15 years old, initiated a series of events that would profoundly affect the balance of power in the Middle East and the life of the young prince. 
   In 1951, King Abdullah was assassinated by a Palestinian nationalist angered by the annexation of the West Bank. The then-Prince Hussein was standing just a few steps away as his grandfather fell. Illness prevented King Abdullah's son, Talal, from ruling, and he abdicated in favor of his own son, Prince Hussein, who formally assumed the throne in May 1953, at the age of 17. King Hussein would go on to rule Jordan for nearly half a century, and was the longest serving ruler in the Middle East at the time of his death. 
   King Hussein was the only ruler that most Jordanians have known. On a more personal note, he was the King of his country for just about as long as I have been alive. I was about two months old when he formally became King. Over the course of my life and his rule, my views about him and his country have changed dramatically. 
   I remember the deep animosity that existed between Jews and Jordanians when I was growing up in the 1960s, culminating in the Six Day War in 1967 during which Jordan lost control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. While I was horrified by the religiously-motivated attacks perpetrated by many Jordanians during this time, I understand and appreciate the religious ties the Arab people feel toward Jerusalem. Two of the holiest sites in Islam, the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque, where King Hussein's grandfather was assassinated, are located there. 
   Throughout these last few decades, I have developed an immense respect for King Hussein and for the Jordanian people. As is true for most people, when I was younger it took me some time to realize that the actions of one person or a group of people are not always an accurate representation of the  true feelings of a country or a political leader. The ethnic and religious violence that has occurred in the Middle East, and indeed around the world, is largely carried out by fringe groups who believe that violence is the only way to send a message, protest an action, or achieve a political goal. 
   Even though it was a violent act that propelled him into power at such a young age, King Hussein chose to reject violence and embrace peace. As a result of his moderate views, in 1974 an Arab summit declared that he was no longer the spokesman for the Palestinian people, and proclaimed that the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and its leader, Yasser Arafat, would assume that role. When the PLO began its ``intifada'' against Israel in 1988, King Hussein formally cut Jordan's ties to the West Bank, but retained a supervisory role over Muslim holy places in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
   In 1994, Jordan became only the second Arab country to sign a peace agreement with Israel. The two countries established diplomatic relations, Israel returned some territory to Jordan, and the countries have begun to work together on common issues such as shared infrastructure and access to potable water. Unfortunately, these courageous moves have sometimes been met with violent acts, particularly from those who felt that peace between Israel and Jordan was premature. The 1997 murder of seven Israeli school girls by a Jordanian soldier was a sobering reminder that not all Jordanians shared their King's support for peace. But, in a testament to his commitment to peace, King Hussein not only condemned this cowardly action, but he also made the effort to travel to Israel to visit with the families of the young victims. 
   One of the King's biggest strengths was his ability to lead quietly by example. His decision to visit the families of the children murdered by one of his army's soldiers is but one instance of this. 
   Even as the King was undergoing treatment for cancer at the Mayo Clinic, the welfare of his people and the status of the Middle East peace process was not far from his mind. He displayed a quiet courage and admirable strength by leaving the hospital and traveling to the Wye River peace negotiations last fall in order to encourage a settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Even as his health was deteriorating, King Hussein's commitment to peace never waned. Selfless acts such as that earned him the respect of people around the world and made him one of the linchpins of the negotiations for peace in the Middle East. 
   Mr. President, this week's Torah portion speaks of the Revelation at Sinai. Moses had been commanded by God to prepare the people for God's descent and visit, and in the wake of dark clouds, thunder and lightning, the sounds of the Shofar, and the trembling of the earth, God spoke to the Israelites and made his commandments known. It is a powerful passage that speaks to the hearts of all of us who believe in God. 
   Despite a history fraught with pain, violence and death, King Hussein understood the universal meaning of the commandments, which instruct us not to covet the land and property of our neighbors, and, above all, not to kill. Throughout his life, King Hussein maintained a vision of a Middle East free from pain, violence and death, and he hoped he would see that day during his lifetime. 
   Alas, although significant progress has been made, including the warming of relations between Jordan and Israel, true peace in the Middle East still escapes us. But there is no doubt in my mind that among the many legacies of King Hussein is a true commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. 
   In his honor and in his memory, let us join him in committing ourselves to the same goal.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing a measure that I sponsored in the 105th Congress to reduce the amount of federal irrigation subsidies received by large agribusiness interests. I believe that reforming federal water pricing policy by reducing subsidies is an important area to examine as a means to achieve our broader objectives of achieving a truly balanced budget. This legislation is also needed to curb fundamental abuses of reclamation law that cost the taxpayer millions of dollars every year. 
   In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed legislation, which came to be known as the Reclamation Act of 1902, to encourage development of family farms throughout the western United States. The idea was to provide needed water for areas that were otherwise dry and give small farms--those no larger than 160 acres--a chance, with a helping hand from the federal government, to establish themselves. According to a 1996 General Accounting Office report, since the passage of the Reclamation Act, the federal government has spent $21.8 billion to construct 133 water projects in the west which provide water for irrigation. Irrigators, and other project beneficiaries, are required under the law to repay to the federal government their allocated share of the costs of constructing these projects. 
   However, as a result of the subsidized financing provided by the federal government, some of the beneficiaries of federal water projects repay considerably less than their full share of these costs. According to the 1996 GAO report, irrigators generally receive the largest amount of federal financial assistance. Since the initiation of the irrigation program in 1902, construction costs associated with irrigation have been repaid without interest. The GAO further found, in reviewing the Bureau of Reclamation's financial reports, that $16.9 billion, or 78 percent, of the $21.8 billion of federal investment in water projects is considered to be reimbursable. Of the reimbursable costs, the largest share--$7.1 billion--is allocated to irrigators. As of September 30, 1994 irrigators have repaid only $941 million of the $7.1 billion they owe. GAO also found that the Bureau of Reclamation will likely shift $3.4 billion of the debt owed by irrigators to other users of the water projects for repayment. 
   There are several reasons why irrigators continue to receive such significant subsidies. Under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, Congress acted to expand the size of the farms that could receive subsidized water from 160 acres to 960 acres. The RRA of 1982 expressly prohibits farms that exceed 960 acres in size from receiving federally-subsidized water. These restrictions were added to the Reclamation law to close loopholes through which federal subsidies were flowing to large agribusinesses rather than the small family farmers that Reclamation projects were designed to serve. Agribusinesses were expected to pay full cost for all water received on land in excess of their 960 acre entitlement. Despite the express mandate of Congress, regulations promulgated under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 have failed to keep big agricultural water users from receiving federal subsidies. The General Accounting Office and the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior continue to find that the acreage limits established in law are circumvented through the creation of arrangements such as farming trusts. These trusts, which in total acreage well exceed the 960 acre limit, are comprised of smaller units that are not subject to the reclamation acreage cap. These smaller units are farmed under a single management agreement often through a combination of leasing and ownership. 
   In a 1989 GAO report, the activities of six agribusiness trusts were fully explored. According to GAO, one 12,345 acre cotton farm (roughly 20 square miles), operating under a single partnership, was reorganized to avoid the 960 acre limitation into 15 separate land holdings through 18 partnerships, 24 corporations, and 11 trusts which were all operated as one large unit. A seventh trust very large trust was the sole topic of a 1990 GAO report. The Westhaven trust is a 23,238 acre farming operation in California's Central  Valley. It was formed for the benefit of 326 salaried employees of the J.G. Boswell Company. Boswell, GAO found, had taken advantage of section 214 of the RRA, which exempts from its 960 acre limit land held for beneficiaries by a trustee in a fiduciary capacity, as long as no single beneficiary's interest exceeds the law's ownership limits. The RRA, as I have mentioned, does not preclude multiple land holdings from being operated collectively under a trust as one farm while qualifying individually for federally subsidized water. Accordingly, the J.G. Boswell Company re-organized 23,238 acres it held as the Boston Ranch by selling them to the Westhaven Trust, with the land holdings attributed to each beneficiary being eligible to receive federally subsidized water. 
   Before the land was sold to Westhaven Trust, the J.G. Boswell Company operated the acreage as one large farm and paid full cost for the federal irrigation water delivered for the 18-month period ending in May 1989. When the trust bought the land, due to the loopholes in the law, the entire acreage became eligible to receive federally subsidized water because the land holdings attributed to the 326 trust beneficiaries range from 21 acres to 547 acres--all well under the 960 acre limit. 
   In the six cases the GAO reviewed in 1989, owners or lessees paid a total of about $1.3 million less in 1987 for federal water then they would have paid if their collective land holdings were considered as large farms subject to the Reclamation Act acreage limits. Had Westhaven trust been required to pay full cost, GAO estimated in 1990, it would have paid $2 million more for its water. The GAO also found, in all seven of these cases, that reduced revenues are likely to continue unless Congress amends the Reclamation Act to close the loopholes allowing benefits for trusts. 
   The Department of the Interior has acknowledged that these problems do exist. Interior published a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register on November 18, 1998. The proposed rulemaking requires farm operators who provide services to more than 960 nonexempt acres westwide, held by a single trust or legal entity or any combination of trusts and legal entities to submit RRA forms to the district(s) where such land is located. If the rule is finalized, the districts will be required to provide specific information about declaring farm operators to Interior annually. This information will be an important step toward enforcing the legislation that I am reintroducing today. 
   This legislation combines various elements of proposals introduced by other members of Congress to close loopholes in the 1982 legislation and to impose a $500,000 means test. This new approach limits the amount of subsidized irrigation water delivered to any operation in excess of the 960 acre limit which claimed $500,000 or more in gross income, as reported on their most recent IRS tax form. If the $500,000 threshold were exceeded, an income ratio would be used to determine how much of the water should be delivered to the user at the full-cost rate, and how much at the below-cost rate. For example, if a 961 acre operation earned $1 million dollars, a ratio of $500,000 (the means test value) divided by their gross income would determine the full cost rate, thus the water user would pay the full cost rate on half of their acreage and the below cost rate on the remaining half. 
   This means testing proposal is featured, for the fourth year in a row, in this year's 1999 Green Scissors report which is being released today. This report is compiled by Friends of the Earth and Taxpayers for Common Sense and supported by a number of environmental, consumer and taxpayer groups. I am pleased to join with the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. GREGG) in distributing a copy of this report to all members of the Senate. The premise of the report is that there are a number of subsidies and projects that could be cut to both reduce the deficit and benefit the environment. This report underscores what I and many others in the Senate have long known: we must eliminate practices that can no longer be justified in light of our effort to achieve a truly balanced budget and eliminate our national debt. The Green Scissors recommendation on means testing water subsidies indicates that if a test is successful in reducing subsidy payments to the highest grossing 10% of farms, then the federal government would recover between $440 million and $1.1 billion per year, or at least $2.2 billion over five years. 
   When countless federal program are subjected to various types of means tests to limit benefits to those who truly need assistance, it makes little sense to continue to allow large business interests to dip into a program intended to help small entities struggling to survive. Taxpayers have legitimate concerns when they learn that their hard earned tax dollars are being expended to assist large corporate interests in select regions of the country who benefit from these loopholes, particularly in tight budgetary times. Other users of federal water projects, such as the power recipients, should also be concerned when they learn that they will be expected to pick up the tab for a portion of the funds that irrigators were supposed to pay back. The federal water program was simply never intended to benefit these large interests, and I am hopeful that legislative efforts, such as the measure I am introducing today, will prompt Congress to fully reevaluate our federal water pricing policy.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during yesterday's impeachment trial proceedings, I voted against the motion to dismiss offered by the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD. I also voted in favor of allowing the House Managers to depose a limited number of witnesses in this case. I would like to explain the reasons for my votes. 
   Let me state first that I understand that this trial is a unique proceeding; it is not precisely a ``trial'' as we understand that term to be used in the criminal context. The Senate, for example, as the Chief Justice made clear in upholding Senator HARKIN's objection early in the trial, is both judge and jury, with the final authority to determine not only the ``guilt'' or ``innocence'' of the defendant, but also the legal standard to apply and what kind of evidence is relevant to the decision. 
   Nonetheless, Sen. BYRD's motion was a motion to dismiss, which I believe gives the motion a legal connotation we must not ignore. I believe that in order to dismiss the case at this point, a Senator should be of the opinion that it is not possible for the House Managers to show that the President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, even if they are permitted to call the witnesses that they want to call. Even apart from the possibility of witness testimony, in order to vote for the motion, a Senator should believe that regardless of what occurs in the closing arguments by the parties and in deliberations in the Senate, that a Senator would not vote to convict. 
   So for me, this motion to dismiss was akin to asking the judge in this case not to send the case to the jury. In a  criminal trial, there is a strong presumption against taking a case out of the hands of the jury, and a very high degree of certainty on the facts of the case is demanded before a judge will take that step. Indeed, a judge must decide that a reasonable juror viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution could not vote to convict the defendant, before he will direct a judgment of acquittal. 
   My view, as of this moment, is that to dismiss this case would in appearance and in fact improperly ``short circuit'' this trial. I simply cannot say that the House Managers cannot prevail regardless of what witnesses might plausibly testify and regardless of what persuasive arguments might be offered either by the Managers or by Senators who support conviction. And when the history of this trial is written, I want it to be viewed as fair and comprehensive, not as having been shortened merely because the result seemed preordained. 
   As Senator COLLINS and I indicated in a letter to Senator BYRD on Saturday and in a unanimous consent request we offered on Monday, my preference would have been to divide the motion to dismiss and allow separate votes on the two articles of impeachment to more closely approximate the separate final votes on the two articles contemplated by the impeachment rules. It would have allowed the Senate to consider the strength of the evidence presented on the two separate articles and the possibility that one of the articles comes closer to the core meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors than the other. 
   I believe that many of my colleagues on the Republican side view the perjury article as less convincing than the obstruction article and might have voted to dismiss it had the opportunity to do that been made available. But we will never know. When a final vote is taken on the articles, and I now believe such votes will almost certainly occur, I hope that my colleagues who did not vote to dismiss the case today will carefully consider the two articles separately. 
   I want to be clear that my vote not to dismiss this case does not mean that I would vote to convict the President and remove him from office or that I am leaning in that direction. I have not reached a decision on that question. It is my inclination, however, to demand a very high standard of proof on this question. Because the House Managers have relied so heavily on the argument that the President has committed the federal crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice as the reason that his conduct rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors, they probably should be required to prove each element of those crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. That is the standard that juries in criminal proceedings must apply. In this case, where the ``impeachability'' question rests so much on a conclusion that the President's conduct was not only reprehensible but also criminal, I currently believe that standard is the most appropriate for a Senator to apply. 
   It is my view at this point that the House Managers' case has some serious problems, and I am not certain that it can be helped by further testimony from witnesses. But I believe it is possible that it can, and the Managers deserve the opportunity to take the depositions they have requested. 
   In voting against the motion to dismiss and to allow witnesses to be subpoenaed, I have not reached the important question of whether, even if the House Managers manage to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, the offenses charged would be ``impeachable'' and require the President to be removed from office. That is an important question that I decided should be addressed in the context of a final vote on the articles after the evidentiary record is complete. Therefore, I want to be clear that my vote against the motion does not mean I am leaning in favor of a final vote to convict the President. I am not. 
   But I have determined, after much thought, that we must continue to move forward and not truncate the proceeding at this point. I believe that it is appropriate for the House Managers, and if they so choose, the President's Counsel, to be able to depose and possibly to present the live testimony of at least a small number of witnesses. And I want to hear final arguments and deliberate with my colleagues before rendering a final verdict on the articles. 
   I reached my decision on witnesses for a number of reasons. First, although I recognize that this is not a typical, ordinary criminal trial, it is significant and in my mind persuasive that in almost all criminal trials witnesses are called by the prosecution in trying to prove its case. Because I have decided that the House Managers probably must be held to the highest standard of proof--beyond a reasonable doubt--I believe that they should have every reasonable opportunity to meet that standard and prove their case. 
   Furthermore, witnesses have been called every time in our history that the Senate has held an impeachment trial. (In two cases, the impeachment of Sen. Blount in 1797 and the impeachment of Judge English in 1926, articles of impeachment passed by the House were dismissed without a trial.) Now I recognize that an unusually exhaustive factual record has been assembled by the Independent Counsel, including numerous interviews with, and grand jury testimony from, key witnesses. That distinguishes this case from a number of past impeachments. But in at least the three judicial impeachments in the 1980s, the record of a full criminal trial (two resulting in conviction and one in acquittal) was available to the Senate and still witnesses testified. 
   In this case, the House Managers strenuously argued that witnesses should be called. It would call the fairness of the process into question were we to deny the House Managers the opportunity to depose at least those witnesses that might shed light on the facts in a few key areas of disagreement in this case. I regard this as a close case in some respects, and the best course to follow is to allow both sides a fair opportunity to make the case they wish to make. 
   This does not mean that I support an unlimited number of witnesses or an unnecessarily extended trial. Furthermore, at this point, I am reserving judgment on the question of whether live testimony on the Senate floor should be permitted. I believe the Senate has the power, and should exercise the power, to assure that any witnesses called to deliver live testimony have evidence that is truly relevant to present. 
   In this regard, I think we should allow somewhat greater latitude to the President's counsel since he is the defendant in this proceeding. I am inclined to give a great deal of deference to requests by the President's counsel to conduct discovery and even call additional witnesses if they feel that is necessary. But at least with respect to the House Manager's case, while we must be fair in allowing them to depose the witnesses they say they need to prove their case, we need not allow them to broaden their case beyond the acts alleged in the articles or inordinately extend the trial with witnesses who cannot reasonably be expected to provide evidence relevant to our decision on those articles. 
   Finally, let me reiterate. My vote against the motion to dismiss should not be interpreted as a signal that I intend to vote to convict the President. Nor does it mean that I would not support a motion to adjourn or a motion to dismiss offered at some later stage of this trial, although I strongly prefer that this trial conclude with a final vote on the articles. It only means that I do not believe that dismissing the case at this moment is the appropriate course for the Senate to follow.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the American campaign finance system is manifestly corrupt. So we are back. And here we will return until America's citizens regain dominion over their government. It is my great pleasure to join Sen. JOHN MCCAIN to once again introduce a bipartisan campaign finance reform bill in the United States Senate. This is the third Congress in which we have taken up this fight together. I want to thank my friend and colleague Senator MCCAIN for his tireless devotion to this issue and his continued willingness to defy the leadership of his party to press it. It will take great effort to achieve consensus and pass this legislation. But I truly do believe that we can make a breakthrough this year, and the reintroduction of the McCain-Feingold bill is the first step toward making that happen. 
   Mr. President, our democracy is sick. The corrupting influence of big money is taking a daily toll on our work here in the Congress and on the confidence of the American people in our ability to do that work fairly and in their interests. The future of our country is truly at stake in this fight for reform, and that is why, despite the setbacks we have suffered in the last two Congress, despite our inability in the last two Congresses to overcome filibusters by a minority of this body, we are back on the floor today. On the first day that bills can be introduced in the United States Senate, I am here to serve notice that reform is at the top of the list of things that we must do in this Congress. And I commit to the American people, and to my constituents in Wisconsin who reelected me to do precisely this job, that I will fight for reform throughout this year and the next year, if need be, until we win. 
   Let me take a moment, Mr. President, to review what the McCain-Feingold bill tries to accomplish. First and foremost, we ban soft money--the unlimited contributions that corporate, labor, and very wealthy individual donors can now give to the political parties. We must bring back some sanity to the campaign finance system by making the parties and donors live once again within the rules that the Congress passed back in the 1970's after the Watergate era. Perhaps some of those rules need to be updated, but throwing the rules out is not an option. The potential for corruption of our legislative process is too great. I will return to the issue of prohibiting soft money in a moment, because it is central to the goals of our bill. 
   Mr. President, this bill also includes the amendment dealing with abuses of ``issue advocacy'' proposed by Senator SNOWE of Maine and Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont and adopted by the Senate last year during debate on our bill. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment is a balanced approach to the ``phony issue ad'' problem that prohibits corporations and unions from purchasing television and radio advertisements within the last 2 months of a campaign if those ads refer to a clearly identified candidate. It is designed to prevent  corporate and union treasury money, which has been banned from federal elections since early in this century, from making its way back into the elections in the form of advertisements that pretend to be about issues, but instead are about elections. 
   Advocacy groups, on the other hand, are permitted to purchase what the bill calls ``electioneering communications,'' as long as they disclose their expenditures and the major donors to the effort and take steps to prevent the use of corporate and union treasury money for the ads. Mr. President, we worked long and hard to perfect this amendment last year, to make sure that it is constitutional, and that it will be effective in combating what has become a very serious subterfuge engaged in by entities that plainly want to influence elections but don't want to abide by the election laws. It is a crucial piece of the campaign finance reform puzzle, and we are proud to have the support of Senators SNOWE and JEFFORDS for our effort and to include their proposal in our bill. 
   The McCain-Feingold bill also takes a further step in addressing the spending of unions in elections by codifying the so-called Beck decision. Under our bill, non-union members who are required to pay agency fees to unions under their state laws will be able to demand an accounting of the use of their fees, and to prevent those fees from being spent for electoral purposes. This provision does not go as far as some of our colleagues might like, but it is a fair and balanced provision that recognizes the need to tread lightly on this issue to maintain bipartisan support for the bill. 
   The bill also contains important provisions designed to improve enforcement and disclosure under our campaign finance laws. It requires electronic filing and posting of campaign finance information on the Internet to make sure that the public can quickly and easily determine who the major contributors are to candidates and parties. It doubles the penalties for ``knowing and willful'' violations of Federal election laws. It provides for more timely disclosure of independent expenditures. It requires campaigns to collect all required contributor information before depositing checks. And it permits the FEC to conduct random audits at the end of a campaign to ensure compliance with the Federal election laws. 
   Our bill also requires political advertisements to carry a disclaimer identifying who is responsible for the content of the campaign ad; and it bars Members of Congress from sending out taxpayer-financed franked mass mailings during the calendar year of their election. 
   It also addresses two important areas where we have learned in the past few years that the law is simply not clear enough or strong enough. Our bill makes it clear that it is unlawful to raise or solicit campaign contributions on Federal property, including the White House and the congressional office buildings. And it makes it clear that contributions from foreign governments and foreign nationals are prohibited in Federal, State and local elections, including donations of soft money. 
   Mr. President, this fight is a fight for the soul and the survival of our American democracy. This democracy cannot survive without the confidence of the people in the integrity of the legislative and the electoral process. The prevalence--no--the dominance--of money in our system of elections and our legislature will in the end cause them to crumble. If we don't take steps to clean up this system it ultimately will consume us along with our finest American ideals. 
   We are now engaged in an historic impeachment trial, in which we are asked to determine as jurors whether the President has committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' and should be removed from office. The American people are divided on this question. 
   But the American people do think it's a crime that the tobacco companies can use money to block a bill to curtail teen smoking. They do think it's a crime that insurance companies can use money to block desperately needed health care reform. They do think it's a crime that telecommunication companies use money to force a bill through Congress that's supposed to increase competition and decrease prices, but leads to cable rates that keep on rising and rising. And they do think it's a crime that corporations and unions are able to give unlimited soft money contributions to the political parties to advance their narrow special interests. 
   They think it's a crime. But here in Washington it is business as usual--until we manage to pass meaningful campaign finance reform. 
   Let me be clear Mr. President, I'm not suggesting that any individual Member of Congress is corrupt. I don't know that any Member of this body has ever traded a vote for a contribution. But while Members are not corrupt, the system is riddled with corruption. It is only human to want to help those who have helped you get elected or reelected, to agree to the meeting, to take the phone call, to allow the opportunity to be persuaded by those who have given money. It is true of the parties, and it is true of the Members, even those who seek always to cast their votes on the merits. The result is that people who don't have money don't get heard. And in the end, those who get heard get their way. 
   Mr. President, as you know, I won a very hard fought campaign last year in which soft money and issue ads and campaign spending were much discussed issues. I learned a lot from that campaign, and my experience has made me even more certain that the system we now live under must be changed and can be changed. 
   As we once again take up this charge, I can tell you how enjoyable and rewarding it can be to run a campaign where endless fundraising is not part of your daily routine. And how it is possible to run a decent campaign without getting down in this soft money swamp. 
   Mr. President, we don't need to point fingers at one another, we just have to rise above politics and do the right thing by the American people. We must clean up our own house, Mr. President. We cannot continue to ignore the corruption in our midst, the cancer that is eating the heart out of the great American compact of trust and faith between the people and their elected representatives. 
   We know that unlimited soft money contributions make a mockery of our election laws and threaten the fairness of the legislative process. We know that phony issue ads paid for with unlimited corporate and union funds undermine the ability of citizens to understand who is bankrolling the candidates and why. We can find bipartisan solutions to these problems that respect all legitimate First Amendment rights if we are willing to put partisan political advantage aside and sit down and work it out. 
   Senator MCCAIN and I are ready--we have been ready ever since we introduced our bill--to make changes to our bill that will bring new supporters on board and get us past the 60 vote threshold that the Senate rules have placed in our way, so long as we stay true to the goal of a cleaner, fairer, system in which money will no longer dominate. 
   We will all be proud of the results if we can do that Mr. President. And the American people will be proud of us. So I look forward to working with Senator MCCAIN and will all my colleagues who want to give the American people a campaign finance system that will protect and nurture our democracy as we enter the 21st century.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. HOLLINGS), in offering the Social Security Trust Fund Protection Act of 1999, legislation extending our current PAYGO budget rules, and clarifying that Congress may not use so-called budget surpluses to pay for tax cuts or new spending when those surpluses are really Social Security Trust Fund balances. 
   Mr. President, as I noted last year when I first offered this measure, it gives me particular pleasure to join with Senator HOLLINGS in introducing this bill. 
   Both in this body and in the Budget Committee, he has been a leading voice for fiscal prudence. 
   While popular in theory, fiscal prudence is often less attractive in practice, but Senator HOLLINGS has taken tough positions, even when those positions may not have been politically attractive. 
   That is the true measure of commitment to honest and prudent budgeting, and I am proud to join him in this effort today. 
   Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today ensures that the PAYGO rule will continue to require that any new entitlement spending or tax cuts be fully paid for. 
   Our bill clarifies current PAYGO procedures to remove any doubt that tax cuts or increased spending must continue to be offset. 
   It extends the PAYGO rule, which currently covers legislation enacted through 2002, until we are no longer using Social Security to mask the deficit. 
   Under our bill, Congress could not use a so-called surplus until it is real, namely when the budget runs a surplus without using Social Security Trust Funds. 
   Mr. President, we have entered an era of transition with regard to the Federal budget. 
   For decades, Congress and the White House ran up huge deficits, producing a mounting national debt. 
   Over the past few years, we have worked to bring down those deficits. 
   Those efforts have been successful, in large part, and we are now witnessing something Congress has not seen in 30 years--actually achieving balance in the so-called unified budget. 
   But, Mr. President, while achieving a balanced unified budget is a significant and encouraging accomplishment, it is not a final victory. 
   We still have a way to go. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, some do want to declare a final victory, and use any projected unified budget surpluses for increased spending or tax cuts. 
   But as many have noted on this floor, projected surpluses based on a so-called unified budget are not real. 
   In fact, far from surpluses, what we really have are continuing on-budget deficits, masked by Social Security revenues. 
   The distinction is absolutely fundamental. 
   As I have noted before, the very word ``surplus'' connotes some extra amount or bonus in addition to the funds we need to meet our expenses and obligations. 
   One dictionary defines ``surplus'' as: ``something more than or in excess of what is needed or required.'' 
   Mr. President, the projected unified budget surplus is not ``more than or in excess of what is needed or required.'' 
   Those funds are needed. 
   They were raised by the Social Security system, specifically in anticipation of commitments to future Social Security beneficiaries. 
   Mr. President, let me just note that the problem of using Social Security trust fund balances to mask the real budget deficit is not a partisan issue. 
   Both political parties have used this accounting gimmick--here in Congress and in the White House. 
   But it must stop, and this legislation can help us stop it. 
   Mr. President, budget rules cannot by themselves reduce the deficit, but they can protect what has been achieved and guard against further abuse. 
   The PAYGO rule governing entitlements and taxes, along with the discretionary spending caps, have kept Congress disciplined and on track. 
   Mr. President, earlier I said we are in an era of budget transition. 
   With some hard work this year, we can leave the years of unified budget deficits behind us. 
   And with some more work, we can move toward real budget balances without using Social Security revenues. 
   Mr. President, that must be our highest priority. 
   If Congress does not begin to rid itself of its addiction to Social Security trust fund balances, we will put the benefits of future retirees at serious risk. 
   Fortunately, Mr. President, we are within reach of the goal of balancing the budget without using the Social Security trust funds. 
   If we stay the course, and continue the tough, sometimes unpopular work of reducing the deficit, we can give this Nation an honest budget, one that is truly balanced. 
   And the time to act is now.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act of 1999. The 106th Congress will mark the fourth successive Congress in which I have introduced this legislation. Very simply Mr. President, this legislation addresses the rapidly growing and very troubling practice of employers conditioning employment or professional advancement upon their employees' willingness to submit claims of discrimination or harassment to arbitration, rather than pursuing them in the courts. In other words, employees raising claims of harassment or discrimination by their employers must submit the adjudication of those claims to arbitration, denying themselves any other remedies may exist under the laws of this Nation. 
   The right to seek redress in a court of law--the right to a jury trial--is one of the most basic rights accorded to employees in this nation. In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress expressly created this right to a jury trial for employees when it voted overwhelmingly to amend Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
   The intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and other civil rights and labor laws, such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, is being circumvented by companies that require all employees to submit to mandatory, binding arbitration. In other words, the company is compelling an agreement to arbitration without regard to basic civil rights of American workers or their right to secure final resolution of such disputes in a court of law under the rules of fairness and due process. 
   How then does the practice of mandatory, binding arbitration comport with the purpose and spirit of our nation's civil rights and sexual harassment laws? The answer is simply that it does not. 
   To address the growing incidents of compulsory arbitration, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act of 1999 amends seven civil rights statutes to guarantee that a federal civil rights or sexual harassment plaintiff can still seek the protection of the U.S. courts rather than be forced into mandatory, binding arbitration. Specifically, this legislation affects claims raised under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes, the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). In the context of the Federal Arbitration Act, the protections of this legislation are extended to claims of unlawful discrimination arising under State or local law and other Federal laws that prohibit job discrimination. 
   Mr. President, this bill is not anti-arbitration, anti-mediation, or anti-alternative dispute resolution. I have long been and will remain a strong supporter of ``voluntary forms'' of alternative methods of dispute resolution that allow the parties to choose not to proceed to litigation. Rather, this bill targets only mandatory binding arbitration clauses in employment contracts. Increasingly, working men and women are faced with the choice of accepting a mandatory arbitration clause in their employment agreement or no employment at all. Despite the appearance of a freely negotiated contract, the reality often amounts to a non-negotiable requirement that prospective employees relinquish their rights to redress in a court of law. Mandatory arbitration allows employers to tell all current and prospective employees in effect, ``If you want to work for us, you will have to check your rights at the door.'' These requirements have been referred to as ``front door'' contracts;  that is, they require an employee to surrender certain rights in order to ``get in the front door.'' As a nation which values work and deplores discrimination, we should not allow this practice to continue. 
   As I noted Mr. President, the 106th Congress marks the fourth successive Congress in which I have introduced this important legislation. In the past year, we have made some advances addressing the unfair use of mandatory binding arbitration clauses. Due to the attention focused on this issue through this legislation, a hearing in the Banking Committee last session, and a series of articles and editorials in prominent periodicals, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) agreed to remove the mandatory binding arbitration clause from its Form U-4, which all prospective securities dealers sign as a condition of employment. The NASD's decision to remove the binding arbitration clause, however, does not prohibit its constituent organizations from including a mandatory, binding arbitration clause in their own employment agreements, even if it is not mandated by the industry as a whole. 
   These changes in the securities industry are a positive development, but the trend toward the use of mandatory, binding arbitration clauses in many industries continues. This bill restores the ability of working men and women to pursue their rights in a venue that they choose and therefore restores and reinvigorates the spirit of our nation's civil rights and sexual harassment laws in the context of these employment contracts. I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that restores a measure of pay equity for our nation's Guardsmen and Reservists. The men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves are the cornerstones of our national defense and domestic infrastructure and deserve more than a pat on the back. 
   Mr. President, as I'm certain my colleagues are well aware, the Guard and Reserve are integral parts of overseas missions, including recent and on-going missions to Iraq and Bosnia. According to statements by DOD officials, guardsmen and reservists will continue to play an increasingly important role in national defense strategy. The National Guard and Reserves deserve the full support they need to carry out their duties.  
   National Guard and Reserve members are becoming increasingly relied upon to shoulder more of the burden of military operations. We need to compensate our citizen-soldiers for this increasing reliance on the Reserve forces. Mr. President, this boils down to an issue of fairness. 
   Mr. President, my bill would correct special duty assignment pay inequities between the Reserve components and the active duty. These inequities should be corrected to take into account the National Guard and Reserves' increased role in our national security, especially on the front lines. Given the increased use of the Reserve components and DOD's increased reliance on them, Reservists deserve fair pay. My bill states that a Reservist who is entitled to basic pay and is performing special duty be paid special duty assignment pay. 
   Mr. President, right now, Reservists are getting shortchanged despite the vital role they play in our national defense. The special duty assignment pay program ensures readiness by compensating specific soldiers who are assigned to duty positions that demand special training and extraordinary effort to maintain a level of satisfactory performance. The program, as it stands now, effectively reduces the ability of the National Guard and Reserve to retain highly dedicated and specialized soldiers. 
   The special duty assignment pay program provides an additional monthly financial incentive paid to enlisted soldiers and airmen who are required to perform extremely demanding duties that require an unusual degree of responsibility. These special duty assignments include certain command sergeants major, guidance counselors, retention non-commissioned officers (NCO's), drill sergeants, and members of the Special Forces. These soldiers, however, do not receive special duty assignment pay while in an IDT status (drill weekends). 
   Between fiscal years 1998 and 1999, spending for the program was cut by $1.6 million, which has placed a fiscal restraint on the number of personnel the Army National Guard is able to provide for under this program. These soldiers deserve better. 
   Mr. President, this bill is paid for by terminating the ineffective, unnecessary, outdated Cold War relic known as Project ELF, or the Extremely Low Frequency Communication System, which costs approximately $12 million per year. 
   Mr. President, the differences in pay and benefits are particularly disturbing since National Guard and Reserve members give up their civilian salaries during the time they are called up or volunteer for active duty. 
   As I'm sure all my colleagues have heard, the President will propose an enormous boost in defense spending over the next six years; an increase of $12 billion for fiscal year 2000 and about $110 billion over the next six years. I have tremendous reservations about spending hikes of this magnitude, but have no such reservations in supporting this nation's citizen-soldiers. The National Guard and Reserve deserve pay and benefit equity and that means paying them what they're worth. 
   Mr. President, according to the National Guard, shortfalls in the operations and maintenance account compromise the Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and end strength. Failing to fully support these vital areas will have both direct and indirect effects. The shortfall puts the Guard's personnel, schools, training, full-time support, and retention and recruitment at risk. Perhaps more importantly, however, it erodes the morale of our citizen-soldiers. 
   Over these past years, the Administration has increasingly called on the Guard and Reserves to handle wider-ranging tasks, while simultaneously offering defense budgets with shortfalls of hundreds of millions of dollars. These shortfalls have increasingly greater effect given the guard and reserves' increased operations burdens. This is a result of new missions, increased deployments, and training requirements. 
   Earlier this month, Charles Cragin, the assistant secretary of defense for reserve affairs, presented DOD's position with regard to the department's working relationship with the National Guard and Reserve. He stated that all branches of the military reserves will be called upon more frequently as the nation pares back the number of soldiers on active duty. This has clearly been DOD's policy for the past few years, but Mr. Cragin went a little further by stating that the reserve units can no longer be considered ``weekend warriors'' but primary components of national defense. 
   Mr. President, in the past, DOD viewed the armed forces as a two-pronged system, 
   with active-duty troops being the primary prong, reinforced by the Reserve component. That strategy has changed with the downsizing of active forces. Defense officials now see reserves as part of the ``total force'' of the military. 
   The National Guard and Reserves will be called more frequently to active duty for domestic support roles and abroad in various peace-keeping efforts. They will also be vital players on special teams trained to deal with weapons of mass destruction deployed within our own borders. According to many military experts, this represents a more salient threat to the United States than the threat of a ballistic missile attack that many of my colleagues have spent so much time addressing. 
   As I'm sure my colleagues know by now, the Army National Guard represents a full 34 percent of total army forces, including 55 percent of combat divisions and brigades, 46 percent of combat support, and 25 percent of combat service support, yet receives just 9.5 percent of Army funds. 
   Mr. President, it should come as no surprise that we have failed to invest fully in the National Guard. It's no surprise because it's the best bargain in the Defense Department. DOD has never been known as a frugal department. From $436 hammers to $640 toilet seats to $2 billion bombers that don't work and the department doesn't seem to want to use, the Department of Defense has a storied history of wasting our tax dollars. Here is an opportunity to spend defense dollars on something that works, that is worthwhile, and enjoys broad support on both sides of the aisle. 
   The National Guard fits the bill. According to a National Guard study, the average cost to train and equip an active duty soldier is $73,000 per year, while it costs $17,000 per year to train and equip a National Guard soldier. The cost of maintaining Army National Guard units is just 23 percent of the cost of maintaining Active Army units. It is time for the Pentagon to quit complaining about lack of funding and begin using their money more wisely and efficiently. 
   Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to see some of these soldiers off as they embarked on these missions and have welcomed them home upon their return, and I have been struck by the courage and professionalism they display. Guardsmen and Reservists have been vital on overseas missions, and here at home. In Wisconsin, the State Guard provides vital support during state emergencies, including floods, ice storms, and train derailments. 
   Mr. President, we have a duty to honor the service of our National Guardsmen and Reservists. One way to do that is to adequately compensate them for their service. I hope my colleagues agree that our citizen-soldiers serve an invaluable role in our national defense, and their paychecks should reflect their contribution.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, similar to bills I offered in the two previous Congresses, to terminate funding for the non-power programs of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). In FY 99, after terminating funding for these programs in the FY 99 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, the Congress revived funding for these programs in the Omnibus Appropriations measure. 
   The TVA was created in 1933 as a government-owned corporation for the unified development of a river basin comprised of parts of seven states. Those activities included the construction of an extensive power system, for which the region is now famous, and regional development or ``non-power'' programs. TVA's responsibilities in the non-power programs include maintaining its system of dams, reservoirs and navigation facilities, and managing TVA-held lands. In addition, TVA provides recreational programs, makes economic development grants to communities, promotes public use of its land and water resources, and operates an Environmental Research Center. Only the TVA power programs are intended to be self-supporting, by relying on TVA utility customers to foot the bill. The cost of these ``non-power'' programs, on the other hand, is covered by appropriated taxpayer funds. 
   This legislation terminates funding for all appropriated programs of the TVA after FY 2000. While I understand the role that TVA has played in our history, I also know that we face tremendous federal budget pressure to reduce spending in many areas. I believe that TVA's discretionary funds should be on the table, and that Congress should act, in accordance with this legislation, to put the TVA appropriated programs on a glide path toward dependence on sources of funds other than appropriated funds. This legislation is a reasonable phased-in approach to achieve this objective, and explicitly codifies both prior recommendations made by the Administration and the TVA Chairman. 
   We should terminate TVA's appropriated programs because there are lingering concerns, brought to light in a 1993 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report, that non-power program funds subsidize activities that should be paid for by non-federal interests. When I ran for the Senate in 1992, I developed an 82+ point plan to eliminate the federal deficit and have continued to work on the implementation of that plan since that time. That plan includes a number of elements in the natural resource area, including the termination of TVA's appropriations-funded programs. 
   In its 1993 report, CBO focused on two programs: the TVA Stewardship Program and the Environmental Research Center, which no longer receives federal funds. Stewardship activities receive the largest share of TVA's appropriated funds. The funds are used for dam repair and maintenance activities. According to 1995 testimony provided by TVA before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Water Appropriations, when TVA repairs a dam it pays 70%, on average, of repair costs with appropriated dollars and covers the remaining 30% with funds collected from electricity ratepayers. 
   This practice of charging a portion of dam repair costs to the taxpayer, CBO highlighted, amounts to a significant subsidy. If TVA were a private utility, and it made modifications to a dam or performed routine dredging, the ratepayers would pay for all of the costs associated with that activity. 
   Despite CBO's charges that a portion of the Stewardship funds may be subsidizing the power program, I have heard from a number of my constituents who are concerned that some of the TVA's non-power activities are critical federal functions. In order to be certain that Congress would be acting properly to terminate certain functions while preserving others under TVA or transferring them to other federal agencies, this bill directs OMB to study TVA's non-power programs. That study, which must be completed by June 1, 1999, requires OMB to evaluate TVA's non-power programs, describe which of those are necessary federal functions, and recommend whether those which are federal functions should be performed by TVA or by another agency. That way, Mr. President, Congress will be fully informed before making a final decision to terminate these funds. 
   Again, while I understand the important role that TVA played in the development of the Tennessee Valley, many other areas of the country have become more creative in federal and state financing arrangements to address regional concerns. Specifically, in those areas where there may be excesses within TVA, I believe we can do better to curb subsidies and eliminate the burden on taxpayers without completely eliminating the TVA, as some in the other body have suggested.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a measure which will serve as a first step towards eliminating the inequities borne by the dairy farmers of Wisconsin and the upper Midwest under the Federal Milk Marketing Order system. The Federal Milk Marketing Order system, created nearly 60 years ago, establishes minimum prices for milk paid to producers throughout various marketing areas in the U.S. For sixty years, this system has discriminated against producers in the Upper Midwest by awarding a high price to dairy farmers in proportion to the distance of their farms from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. 
   This legislation is very simple. It identifies the single most harmful and unjust feature of the current system, and corrects it. 
   Under the current archaic law, the price for fluid milk increases at a rate of 21 cents per hundred miles from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, even though most milk marketing orders do not receive any milk from Wisconsin. Fluid milk prices, as a result, are $2.98 higher in Florida than in Wisconsin and over $1.00 higher in Texas. This method of pricing fluid milk is not only arbitrary, but also out of date and out of sync  with the market conditions of 1999. It is time for this method of pricing--known as single-basing-point pricing--to come to an end. 
   The bill I introduce today will prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture from using distance or transportation costs from any location as the basis for pricing milk, unless significant quantities of milk are actually transported from that location into the recipient market. The Secretary will have to comply with the statutory requirement that supply and demand factors be considered as specified in the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act when setting milk prices in marketing orders. The fact remains that single-basing-point pricing simply cannot be justified based on supply and demand for milk both in local and national markets. 
   This bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress on specifically which criteria are used to set milk prices. Finally, the Secretary will have to certify to Congress that the criteria used by the Department do not in any way attempt to circumvent the prohibition on using distance or transportation cost as basis for pricing milk. 
   This one change is so crucial to Upper Midwest producers, because the current system has penalized them for many years. By providing disparate profits for producers in other parts of the country and creating artificial economic incentives for milk production, Wisconsin producers have seen national surpluses rise, and milk prices fall. Rather than providing adequate supplies of fluid milk in some parts of the country, the prices have led to excess production. 
   The prices have provided production incentives beyond those needed to ensure a local supply of fluid milk in some regions, leading to an increase in manufactured products in those marketing orders. Those manufactured products directly compete with Wisconsin's processed products, eroding our markets and driving national prices down. 
   The perverse nature of this system is further illustrated by the fact that since 1995 some regions of the U.S., notably the Central states and the Southwest, are producing so much milk that they are actually shipping fluid milk north to the Upper Midwest. The high fluid milk prices have generated so much excess production, that these markets distant from Eau Claire are now encroaching upon not only our manufactured markets, but also our markets for fluid milk, further eroding prices in Wisconsin. 
   The market distorting effects of the fluid price differentials in federal orders are manifest in the Congressional Budget Office estimate that eliminating the orders would save $669 million over five years. Government outlays would fall, CBO concludes, because production would fall in response to lower milk prices and there would be fewer government purchases of surplus milk. The regions which would gain and lose in this scenario illustrate the discrimination inherent to the current system. Economic analyses show that farm revenues in a market undisturbed by Federal Orders would actually increase in the Upper Midwest and fall in most other milk-producing regions. 
   The data clearly show that Upper Midwest producers are hurt by distortions built into a single-basing-point system that prevent them from competing effectively in a national market. 
   While this system has been around since 1937, the practice of basing fluid milk price differentials on the distance from Eau Claire was formalized in the 1960's, when the Upper Midwest arguably was the primary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to encourage local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that did not traditionally produce enough fluid milk to meet their own needs. 
   Mr. President, that is no longer the case. The Upper Midwest is neither the lowest cost production area nor a primary source of reserve supplies of milk. In many of the markets with higher fluid milk differentials, milk is produced efficiently, and in some cases, at lower cost than the upper Midwest. Unfortunately, the prices didn't adjust with changing economic conditions, most notably the shift of the dairy industry away from the Upper Midwest and towards the Southwest, specifically California, which now leads the nation in milk production. 
   Fluid milk prices should have been lowered to reflect that trend. Instead, in 1985, the prices were increased for markets distant from Eau Claire. USDA has refused to use the administrative authority provided by Congress to make the appropriate adjustments to reflect economic realities. They continue to stand behind single-basing-point pricing. 
   The result has been a decline in the Upper Midwest dairy industry, not because they can't produce a product that can compete in the market place, but because the system discriminates against them. Since 1980, Wisconsin has lost over 15,000 dairy farmers. Today, Wisconsin loses dairy farmers at a rate of 5 per day. The Upper Midwest, with the lowest fluid milk prices, is shrinking as a dairy region despite the dairy-friendly climate of the region. Other regions with higher fluid milk prices are growing rapidly. 
   In an unregulated market with a level playing field, these shifts in production might be fair. But in a market where the government is setting the prices and providing that artificial advantage to regions outside the Upper Midwest, the current system is unconscionable. 
   This bill is a first step in reforming federal orders by prohibiting a grossly unfair practice that should have been dropped long ago. Although I understand that, because of mandates in the 1996 Farm Bill, the USDA is currently deliberating possible changes to the current system, one of the options being considered maintains this debilitating single-basing-point pricing system. This bill is the beginning of reform. It identifies the one change that is absolutely necessary in any outcome--the elimination of single-basing-point pricing. 
   I urge the Secretary of Agriculture to do the right thing and bring reform to this out-dated system. No proposal is reform without this important policy change.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my good friend the senior Senator from Arizona (Mr. MCCAIN) in introducing legislation to reduce the number of presidential political appointees. Specifically, the bill caps the number of political appointees at 2,000. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates this measure  would save $333 million over the next five years. 
   The bill is based on the recommendations of a number of distinguished panels, including most recently, the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process. The task force findings, released last fall, are only the latest in a long line of recommendations that we reduce the number of political appointees in the Executive Branch. For many years, the proposal has been included in CBO's annual publication Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options, and it was one of the central recommendations of the National Commission on the Public Service, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. 
   Mr. President, this proposal is also consistent with the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, which called for reductions in the number of federal managers and supervisors, arguing that ``over-control and micro management'' not only ``stifle the creativity of line managers and workers, they consume billions per year in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.'' 
   Those sentiments were also expressed in the 1989 report of the Volcker Commission, when it argued the growing number of presidential appointees may ``actually undermine effective presidential control of the executive branch.'' The Volcker Commission recommended limiting the number of political appointees to 2,000, as this legislation does. 
   Mr. President, it is essential that any Administration be able to implement the policies that brought it into office in the first place. Government must be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But as the Volcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of political appointees in recent years has not made government more effective or more responsive to political leadership. 
   Between 1980 and 1992, the ranks of political appointees grew 17 percent, over three times as fast as the total number of Executive Branch employees and looking back to 1960 their growth is even more dramatic. In his recently published book ``Thickening Government: Federal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability,'' author Paul Light reports a startling 430% increase in the number of political appointees and senior executives in Federal government between 1960 and 1992. 
   In recommending a cap on political appointees, the Volcker Commission report noted that the large number of presidential appointees simply cannot be managed effectively by any President or White House. The Commission argued that this lack of control and political focus ``may actually dilute the President's ability to develop and enforce a coherent, coordinated program and to hold cabinet secretaries accountable.'' 
   Adding organizational layers of political appointees can also restrict access to important resources, while doing nothing to reduce bureaucratic impediments. 
   In commenting on this problem, author Paul Light noted, ``As this sediment has thickened over the decades, presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of government, and the front lines from them.'' Light added that ``Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in stripping government of the barriers to doing its job effectively.....'' 
   The Volcker Commission also asserted that this thickening barrier of temporary appointees between the President and career officials can undermine development of a proficient civil service by discouraging talented individuals from remaining in government service or even pursuing a career in government in the first place. 
   Mr. President, former Attorney General Elliot Richardson put it well when he noted:  
   But a White House personnel assistant sees the position of deputy assistant secretary as a fourth-echelon slot. In his eyes that makes it an ideal reward for a fourth-echelon political type--a campaign advance man, or a regional political organizer. For a senior civil servant, it's irksome to see a position one has spent 20 or 30 years preparing for preempted by an outsider who doesn't know the difference between an audit exception and an authorizing bill.  
   Mr. President, the report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process identified another problem aggravated by the mushrooming number of political appointees, namely the increasingly lengthy process of filling these thousands of positions. As the Task Force reported, both President Bush and President Clinton were into their presidencies for many months before their leadership teams were fully in place. The Task Force noted that ``on average, appointees in both administrations were confirmed more than eight months after the inauguration--one-sixth of an entire presidential term.'' By contrast, the report noted that in the presidential transition of 1960, ``Kennedy appointees were confirmed, on average, two and a half months after the inauguration.'' 
   In addition to leaving vacancies among key leadership positions in government, the appointment process delays can have a detrimental effect on potential appointees. The Twentieth Century Fund Task Force reported that appointees can ``wait for months on end in a limbo of uncertainty and awkward transition from the private to the public sector.'' 
   Mr. President, there have been some modest reductions in the number of political appointees in recent years, but further reductions are needed. 
   The sacrifices that deficit reduction efforts require must be spread among all of us. This measure requires us to bite the bullet and impose limitations upon political appointments that both parties may well wish to retain. The test of commitment to deficit reduction, however, is not simply to propose measure that impact someone else. 
   As reduce the number of government employees, streamline agencies, and make government more responsive, we should also right size the number of political appointees, ensuring a sufficient number to implement the policies of any Administration without burdening the Federal budget with unnecessary, possibly counterproductive political jobs. 
   Mr. President, when I ran for the U.S. Senate in 1992, I developed an 82 point plan to reduce the Federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget. Since that time, I have continued to work toward enactment of many of the provisions of that plan and have added new provisions on a regular basis. 
   The legislation I am introducing today reflects one of the points included on the original 82 point plan calling for streamlining various federal agencies and reducing agency overhead costs. I am pleased to have this opportunity to continue to work toward implementation of the elements of the deficit reduction plan.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation terminating the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), a medical school run by the Department  of Defense. The measure is one I proposed when I ran for the U.S. Senate, and was part of a larger, 82 point plan to reduce the Federal budget deficit. The most recent estimates of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) project that terminating the school would save $273 million over the next five years, and when completely phased-out, would generate $450 million in savings over five years. 
   USUHS was created in 1972 to meet an expected shortage of military medical personnel. Today, however, USUHS accounts for only a small fraction of the military's new physicians, less than 12 percent in 1994 according to CBO. This contrasts dramatically with the military's scholarship program which provided over 80 percent of the military's new physicians in that year. 
   Mr. President, what is even more troubling is that USUHS is also the single most costly source of new physicians for the military. CBO reports that based on figures from 1995, each USUHS trained physician costs the military $615,000. By comparison, the scholarship program cost about $125,000 per doctor, with other sources providing new physicians at a cost of $60,000. As CBO noted in their Spending and Revenue Options publication, even adjusting for the lengthier service commitment required of USUHS trained physicians, the cost of training them is still higher than that of training physicians from other sources, an assessment shared by the Pentagon itself. Indeed, CBO's estimate of the savings generated by this measure also includes the cost of obtaining physicians from other sources. 
   The House of Representatives has voted to terminate this program on several occasions, and the Vice President's National Performance Review joined others, ranging from the Grace Commission to the CBO, in raising the question of whether this medical school, which graduated its first class in 1980, should be closed because it is so much more costly than alternative sources of physicians for the military. 
   Mr. President, the real issue we must address is whether USUHS is essential to the needs of today's military structure, or if we can do without this costly program. The proponents of USUHS frequently cite the higher retention rates of USUHS graduates over physicians obtained from other sources as a justification for continuation of this program, but while a greater percentage of USUHS trained physicians may remain in the military longer than those from other sources, the Pentagon indicates that the alternative sources already provide an appropriate mix of retention rates. Testimony by the Department of Defense before the Subcommittee on Force Requirements and Personnel noted that the military's scholarship program meets the retention needs of the services. 
   And while USUHS only provides a small fraction of the military's new physicians, it is important to note that relying primarily on these other sources has not compromised the ability of military physicians to meet the needs of the Pentagon. According to the Office of Management and Budget, of the approximately 2,000 physicians serving in Desert Storm, only 103, about 5%, were USUHS trained. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by recognizing that USUHS has some dedicated supporters in the U.S. Senate, and I realize that there are legitimate arguments that those supporters have made in defense of this institution. The problem, however, is that the federal government can no longer afford to continue every program that provides some useful function. 
   This is especially true in the area of defense spending. Many in this body argue that the Defense budget is too tight, that a significant increase in spending is needed to address concerns about shortfalls in recruitment and retention, maintenance backlogs, and other indicators of a lower level of readiness. 
   Mr. President, the debate over our level of readiness is certainly important, and it may well be that more Defense funding should be channeled to these specific areas of concern. 
   But before advocates of an increased Defense budget ask taxpayers to foot the bill for hundreds of billions more in spending, they owe it to those taxpayers to trim Defense programs that are not justified. 
   In the face of our staggering national debt and annual deficits, we must prioritize and eliminate programs that can no longer be sustained with limited federal dollars, or where a more cost-effective means of fulfilling those functions can be substituted. The future of USUHS continues to be debated precisely because in these times of budget restraint it does not appear to pass the higher threshold tests which must be applied to all federal spending programs.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation, originally introduced in the 105th Congress. This measure will give relief to the taxpayers of this country, who now pay millions every year to provide cotton producers with an expensive and unnecessary perk no other farmer enjoys. 
   Each year, the Federal Government's Agriculture Department pays millions of dollars in storage costs for cotton farmers. Last year, this program provided more than $23 million to store the cotton crop of participating farmers. My measure puts all commodities on a more equal footing by eliminating the storage subsidy for cotton, the only commodity whose producers still enjoy this privilege. 
   Mr. President, prior to the passage of the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill, farmers producing wheat and feed grains relied heavily on the Farmer Owned Reserve Program to assist them in repaying their overdue loans when times were tough. They would roll their non-recourse loans into the Farmer Owned Reserve Program which would allow them the opportunity to pay back their loan, without interest, and also get assistance in paying storage costs. Although cotton producers were not eligible to participate in that particular program, they were offered a similar subsidy and other perks through the cotton program. Those were the days of heavy agriculture subsidization, when the government dictated prices, provided price supports, and more often than not, had over-surpluses of wheat, corn and other feed grains--driving down domestic prices. The 1996 Farm Bill, sought to bring farm policy in line with a realistic agricultural and economic view, that the agriculture industry must be more market oriented--must not rely so much on government price interference.  
   Mr. President, although the Farm Bill was successful in ridding agriculture policy of much of the weight of government intrusion that burdened it for years, there are still hidden subsidies costing taxpayers billions. This legislation would prevent USDA from factoring cotton industry storage costs into Marketing Loan Program calculations. This costly and unnecessary benefit is bestowed on the producers of no other commodity. 
   Farmers, except those who produce cotton, are required to pay storage cost through the maturity date of their support loans. Producers must prepay or arrange to pay storage costs through the loan maturity date or USDA reduces the amount of the loan by deducting the amount necessary for prepaid storage. Cotton producers are not required to prepay storage costs. When they redeem a loan under marketing loan provisions or forfeit collateral, USDA pays the cost of the accrued storage. 
   It is interesting to note, Mr. President, that in a 1994 audit of the cotton program, USDA's Office of Inspector General found no reason for USDA to pay the accrued storage costs of cotton producers. The Inspector General recommended that USDA ``revise procedures to eliminate the automatic payment of cotton storage charges by CCC and make provisions consistent with the treatment of storage charges on other program crops''. 
   Although those in the cotton industry will argue that the automatic payments were eliminated in the Farm Bill, in reality, those payments are now simply hidden. It's true that certain provisions have been removed from the statute which mandates that USDA pay these charges. Now, USDA freely chooses to waste the taxpayers money by paying these costs, allowing cotton producers to subtract their storage costs from the market value of their cotton, providing a larger difference with the loan rate, and therefore receiving a higher return. 
   Marketing Loan Programs are designed to encourage producers to redeem their loans and market their crops, but USDA payment of cotton storage costs discourage loan redemption. As long as the adjusted world price is at or below the loan rate, producers can delay loan redemption in the secure expectation that domestic prices will rise or the adjusted world price will decline regardless of accruing storage costs. 
   Mr. President, its time to stop kidding ourselves. Let's eliminate this subsidy before it costs hardworking Americans any more. Let's bring equity to the commodities program. Lets finish what the Farm Bill started--a more market oriented agriculture program. One that benefits us all.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I once again come to the floor to offer a bill to terminate the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency Communication System. I am again pleased to be joined in introducing this bill with the senior Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. KOHL) and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. WYDEN). 
   Mr. President, this bill would terminate the operation of the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency Communication System, or Project ELF, as it's more familiarly known, while maintaining the infrastructure in Wisconsin and Michigan for resuming should a resumption in operation become necessary. As my colleagues are well aware, I have long opposed this needless project. 
   Project ELF is an ineffective, unnecessary, outdated Cold War relic that is not wanted by most residents in my state. The members of the Wisconsin delegation have fought hard for years to close down Project ELF; I have introduced legislation during each Congress since taking office to terminate it; and I have even recommended it for closure to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. 
   This project has been opposed by residents of Wisconsin since its inception, but for years we were told that the national security considerations of the Cold War outweighed our concerns about this installation in our state. As we continue our efforts to truly balance the federal budget and as the Department of Defense continues to struggle to address readiness concerns, it is clear that Project ELF should be closed down. If enacted, my legislation would save approximately $12 million a year. 
   Project ELF is a one-way, primitive messenger system designed to signal to--not communicate with--deeply submerged Trident nuclear submarines. It is a ``bell ringer'', a pricey beeper system, used to tell the submarine when to rise to the surface to get a detailed message through a less primitive communications systems. 
   It was designed at a time when the threat and consequences of detection to our submarines was real. But ELF was never developed to an effective capability, and the demise of the Soviet threat has certainly rendered it unnecessary. 
   In fact, Mr. President, the submarine capabilities of our potential adversaries have noticeably deteriorated or remain far behind those of our Navy. The primary mission of our attack submarines was to fight the heart of the Soviet navy, its attack submarine force. This mission included hunting down Soviet submarines. Due to Russia's continued economic hardships, they continue to cede ground to us in technology and training. Reports even contend that Russia is having trouble keeping just one or two of its strategic nuclear submarines operational. According to General Eugene E. Habiger, USAF (Ret.) and former commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, Moscow's ``sub fleet is belly-up.'' 
   Further, of our known potential adversaries, only Russia and China possess ballistic missile-capable submarines. And China's one ballistic missile capable submarine is used solely as a test platform. Russia's submarine fleet has shrunk from more than 300 vessels to about 100. Even Russia's most modern submarines can't be used to full capability because Russia can't adequately train its sailors. The threat for which Project ELF was designed no longer exists. 
   Even the Pentagon and members of this body are beginning to see the need for reevaluating our strategic forces, including our Trident ballistic missile submarines. Earlier this month, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he wants to reduce the fleet from 18 to 14. And Chairman WARNER agreed with the need to reevaluate priorities on strategic weapons. 
   With the end of the Cold War, Project ELF becomes harder and harder to justify. Trident submarines no longer need to take that extra precaution against Soviet nuclear forces. They can now surface on a regular basis with less danger of detection or attack. They can also receive more complicated messages through very low frequency (VLF) radiowaves or lengthier messages through satellite systems, if it can be done more cheaply. 
   During the 103rd Congress, I worked with Senator Nunn to include an amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 requiring a report by the Secretary of Defense on the benefits and costs of continued operation of Project ELF. The report issued by DoD was particularly disappointing because it basically argued that because Project ELF may have had a purpose during the Cold War, it should continue to operate after the Cold War as part of the complete complement of command and control links configured for the Cold War.  
   Did Project ELF play a role in helping to minimize the Soviet threat? Perhaps. Did it do so at risk to the community? Perhaps. Does it continue to play a vital security role to the Nation? No. 
   In the fiscal year 1996 DoD authorization bill, the Senate cut funding for the program, but again it was resurrected in conference. 
   I'd like to note here that Members in both Wisconsin and Michigan, the states in which Project ELF is located, support terminating the project. Also, former 
   Commanders-in-Chief of Strategic Command, General George Lee Butler and General Eugene E. Habiger, called for an end to Cold War nuclear weapons practices, of which Project ELF is a harrowing reminder. Additionally, the Center for Defense Information called for ending the program, noting that ``U.S. submarines operating under present and foreseeable worldwide military conditions can receive all necessary orders and instructions in timely fashion without need for Project ELF.'' 
   As I mentioned, this bill would terminate operation of Project ELF, but would call for the Defense Department to maintain its infrastructure. Should Project ELF become necessary for future military action, DoD could quickly bring it back on-line. In essence, this bill would save DoD some much-needed operations and maintenance funds without degrading its capabilities. 
   Mr. President, I'd also like to briefly touch on the public health and environmental concerns associated with Project ELF. For almost two decades, we have received inconclusive data on this project's effects on Wisconsin and Michigan residents. In 1984, a U.S. District Court ordered that the project be shut down because the Navy paid inadequate attention to the system's possible health effects and violated the National Environmental Policy Act. Interestingly, that decision was overturned because U.S. national security, at the time, prevailed over public health and environmental concerns. 
   More than 40 medical studies point to a link between electromagnetic pollution and cancer and abnormalities in both animal and plant species. Metal fences near the two transmitters must be grounded to avoid serious shock from the presence of high voltages. 
   Mr. President, last year, an international committee, convened by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences urged the study of electric and magnetic fields as a possible cause of cancer. Project ELF produces the same kind of electric and magnetic fields cited by this distinguished committee. The committee's announcement seems to confirm the fears of many of my constituents. 
   And recently, I have heard from a number of dairy farmers who are convinced that the stray voltage associated with ELF transmitters has demonstrably reduced milk production. 
   In recent years, a coalition of fiscal conservatives and environmentalists have targeted Project ELF because it both fiscally and environmentally harmful. The coalition, which includes groups like the Concord Coalition, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the National Wildlife Federation, and Friends of the Earth, took aim at about 70 wasteful and dangerous programs. I hope we take their heed and end this program. 
   Mr. President, this bill achieves two vital goals of many of my colleagues here. It terminates a wasteful and unnecessary Cold War era program, while allowing the Pentagon to address its readiness shortfalls. This is a win-win situation and I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to again introduce legislation terminating the U.S. Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet Program. I am pleased to be joined again by Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator WYDEN on this important legislation. 
   Mr. President, given the Pentagon's self-reported readiness crisis, I have serious doubts as to whether we can continue funding this costly program while it fails to live up to expectations and continues to experience highly visible problems. 
   In just the past year, we've been told that the program-threatening wing drop problem is solved, but maybe not completely. We've also learned that program officials may not have been exactly forthright in letting Pentagon superiors in on the seriousness of that problem. We've learned that the Super Hornet doesn't meet all of the performance standards expected of it. And most recently, we've learned that cracks in the aircraft's engines have forced the Navy to approach another contractor. 
   This, Mr. President, should not be the track record of the plane that the Navy called the ``future of naval aviation.'' In fact, this history more closely resembles the previously-canceled A-12 attack plane. And I know that neither the Pentagon nor the Congress wants another debacle like the A-12. 
   Mr. President, I began this debate over the Super Hornet in 1997 on the basis of the 1996 General Accounting Office report ``Navy Aviation: F/A-18E/F Will Provide Marginal Operational Improvement at High Cost.'' In this report, GAO studied the rationale and need for the F/A-18E/F in order to determine whether continued development of the aircraft is the most cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy's tactical aircraft fleet. GAO concluded that the marginal improvements of the F/A-18E/F are far outweighed by the high cost of the program. 
   Since that time, I have offered numerous pieces of legislation that run the gamut from outright termination of the program to continued oversight of it. I asked GAO for a follow-up review. I have even asked DoD's Inspector General to investigate various aspects of the program, including testing evaluation. The one constant, however, has been the program's continuing disappointments. 
   Mr. President, as we have all heard by now, wing drop causes the aircraft to rock back and forth when it is flying at altitudes and speeds at which air-to-air combat maneuvers are expected to occur. 
   What really disturbs me about wing drop is that almost a year and a half went by after the discovery of the problem before the Office of the Secretary of Defense acknowledged the problem. The Pentagon's ignorance is caused either by shamefully poor communication or the withholding of program information by the Navy. For that reason, I have asked the DoD Inspector General to take a look at the wing drop fiasco. 
   Mr. President, the Navy's Super Hornet test team discovered the wing drop problem in March, 1996. In October of that year, the Navy rated it a priority problem. On February 5, 1997, wing drop was placed on an official deficiency report. In that report, the Navy classified wing drop as a **1 deficiency. In other words, one that will cause aircraft control loss, equipment destruction, or injury. This is the most serious category that the Navy assigns to program deficiencies. In the same report, the Super Hornet's test director stated that wing drop, ``will prevent or severely restrict the performance of air-to-air tracking tasks during air-to-air combat maneuvering. Therefore, the operational effectiveness will be compromised.'' On March 12, 1997, the test team characterized the problem as being ``an unacceptable deficiency''. 
   Two weeks later, the Navy's Defense Acquisition Board met with the test team, which failed to mention the wing drop problem at all. Following that meeting, Secretary Cohen approved the group's recommendation to spend 1.9  billion dollars for the first dozen Super Hornets. 
   In November, 1997, the assistant secretary of Defense reportedly first informed the Navy Secretary of the wing drop problem. In December, the problem was moved to the program's high-risk category. It should also be noted that wing drop was considered by the Navy and the contractor, Boeing, to be the most challenging technical risk to the program at that time. This past February 4, Secretary Cohen stated unequivocally that the program would ``not go forward until wing drop is corrected.'' A month later, a Navy blue ribbon panel reported that the Navy does ``not have a good understanding'' of wing drop and that the current porous wing fold fix is ``not a solution''. In May, Secretary Cohen released funds for the second round of production aircraft. Through it all, the Pentagon apparently didn't think wing drop was significant enough to warrant full disclosure. 
   Following the release of the 1998 GAO report and reports of the wing drop fiasco, I asked the Secretary to document the wing drop problem. Specifically, I asked Secretary Cohen questions on who knew of the problem and when they knew it. 
   In April, I received the Secretary's disappointing response. The essence of his answers to my questions is that wing drop was not a significant enough issue to warrant disclosure to the Defense Acquisition Board before its decision to recommend production of the first lot of aircraft. 
   Mr. President, given the Navy's classification of wing drop, the test director's assessment of the mission impact, and the significant efforts that were underway to resolve the problem, the Navy's failure to discuss the wing drop problem with DoD officials responsible for making the decision on whether to proceed into production of the initial Super Hornets reflects, in my view, questionable judgement at best and underscores the need for continued DoD and congressional oversight of the Super Hornet's development and production program. 
   One final point, Mr. President. It should be made clear that DoD and the Navy did not begin openly discussing wing drop until after the assistant secretary John Douglass' November 20, 1997, memo on the issue to Navy Secretary John Dalton appeared in the press. In fact, during a February, 1998, hearing before the House National Security Committee's Research and Development Subcommittee, Chairman Curt Weldon voiced his displeasure with having to learn about the Super Hornet's wing drop problem through the media rather than from the Navy. If the chairman of the subcommittee responsible for the development of the Super Hornet has to rely on the media to learn about one of the Defense Department's costliest programs, then I think it's fairly reliable that all the information was not made available. 
   Mr. President, the Navy has based the need for development and procurement of the F/A-18E/F on existing or projected operational deficiencies of the F/A-18C/D Hornet in the following key areas: strike range, carrier recovery payload and survivability. In addition, the Navy notes limitations of current Hornets with respect to avionics growth space and payload capacity. 
   The Navy and Boeing call these points the ``five pillars'' of the Super Hornet program. The most recent GAO report and my review of the program show that the five pillars are weak and crumbling. 
   GAO identifies problems with the Super Hornet in each of these five areas. Meanwhile, the Navy's responses to the criticisms are at odds with their own arguments in favor of the program. In the 1998 report, GAO identified problems that may diminish the effectiveness of the plane's survivability improvements, problems that could degrade engine performance and service life, and dangerous weapons separation problems that require additional testing. 
   In July, 1997, the Navy's Program Risk Advisory Board stated that ``operational testing may determine that the aircraft is not operationally effective or suitable.'' That December, the board reversed its position and said the E/F is potentially operationally effective and suitable, but also reiterated its concerns with certain systems that are supposed to make the Super Hornet superior to the Hornet. 
   These are not glowing reviews for any program, but are downright awful for an aircraft program slated to cost upwards of $100 billion. We should not gamble with our pilots' lives and more than 100 billion taxpayer dollars. These stakes are too high. 
   Also in the report, GAO asserted the Super Hornet doesn't accelerate or maneuver as well as the Hornet. DoD readily agrees, but maintains that this is an acceptable trade-off for other capabilities. I wonder if a pilot under fire would agree. 
   It gets better, Mr. President. The publication, Inside the Pentagon, reported last February that the Navy will not hold the Super Hornet to strict performance specifications in three areas. It published a copy of a memo written by Rear Admiral Dennis McGinn, the Navy's officer in charge of air warfare programs, that ordered the E/F would not be strictly held to performance specifications in turning, climbing and maneuvering. 
   Everyone can agree that these are important performance criteria for a state-of-the-art fighter and attack plane. It turns out that this memo was sent to the E/F test team after the team concluded that the Super Hornet was, in some cases, not as proficient in turning or accelerating as the Hornet. The test team concluded that the single-seat E, when outfitted with a relatively light load of air-to-air missiles, is ``slightly less'' capable than the single-seat C in terms of instantaneous turn performance, sustained turn performance, and in some cases, of unloaded acceleration. Interestingly enough, the C models used in the comparisons were not even the most advanced C's available. These deficiencies 
   haven't improved since then. 
   GAO also said that the Navy board's program officials came to ``the realization that the F/A-18E/F may not be as capable in a number of operational performance areas as the most recently procured `C' model aircraft that are equipped with an enhanced performance engine.'' 
   Mr. President, the Navy's own test team has stated that the new plane does not perform as well as the reliable version currently in use in key performance areas. But this isn't enough. The Navy now says these performance criteria are not important. Mr. President, this is shameful. 
   In its 1996 report, GAO reached a number of conclusions. It found that the Super Hornet offers only marginal improvements over the Hornet, and that these are far outweighed by the high cost. It found that the Hornet can be modified to meet every capacity the Super Hornet is intended to fulfill. And GAO found that the Defense Department could save $17 billion by purchasing additional improved Hornets instead of Super Hornets. The Congressional Budget Office updated that cost savings last year to $15 billion, still a princely sum, especially given DoD's hopes of increasing defense spending by roughly that amount each year for the next six years. 
   The report also addressed other purported improvements of the Super Hornet over the Hornet. GAO concluded that the reported operational deficiencies of the C/D that the Navy cited to justify the E/F either have not materialized as projected or that such deficiencies can be corrected with nonstructural changes to the current C/D and additional upgrades made which would further improve its capabilities. 
   GAO even rebutted all of the claims of the Hornet's disadvantages. The report concluded that the Navy's F/A-18 strike range requirements can be met by either the E/F or the C/D, and that the E/F's increased range is achieved at the expense of its aerial combat performance. It notes that even with increased range, both aircraft will still require aerial refueling for low-altitude missions. 
   Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, the E/F's increased strike range is achieved at the expense of the aircraft's aerial combat performance. This is shown by its sustained turn rate, maneuvering, and acceleration--critical components of its ability to maneuver in either offensive or defensive modes. 
   GAO also disputes the Navy's contention that the C/D cannot carry 480 gallon external fuel tanks. Next, the deficiency in carrier recovery payload which the Navy anticipated for the F/  A-18C simply has not materialized. GAO notes that while it is not necessary, upgrading F/A-18C's with stronger landing gear could allow them to recover carrier payloads of more than 10,000 pounds, greater than the 9,000 pounds sought for the F/A-18E/F. 
   Additional improvements have been made or are planned for the Hornet to enhance its survivability including improvements to reduce its radar detectability, while survivability improvements of the Super Hornet are questionable. For example, because the Super Hornet will be carrying weapons and fuel externally, the radar signature reduction improvements derived from the structural design of the aircraft will be diminished and will only help the aircraft penetrate slightly deeper than the Hornet into an integrated defensive system before being detected. 
   Mr. President, as we discuss survivability, we should recall the outstanding performance of the Hornet in the Gulf War a few years ago. By the Navy's own account, the C/D performed extraordinarily well, and, in the Navy's own words, experienced ``unprecedented survivability.'' 
   The Navy predicted that by the mid-1990's the Hornet would not have growth space to accommodate additional new weapons and systems under development. Specifically, the Navy predicted that by fiscal year 1996, C/D's would only have 0.2 cubic feet of space available for future avionics growth; however, 5.3 cubic feet of available space have been identified for future system growth. Furthermore, technological advancements such as miniaturization, modularity and consolidation may result in additional growth space for future avionics. 
   Also, while the Super Hornet will provide some increase in air-to-air capability by carrying two extra missiles, it will not increase its ability to carry the heavier, precision-guided, air-to-ground weapons that are capable of hitting fixed and mobile hard targets nor to deliver heavier standoff weapons that will be used to increase aircraft survivability. 
   So we have a plane that doesn't really do the things the Navy said it would do, and in some cases does not perform as well as the older version, but we're supposed to pay probably three times more for the Super Hornet. 
   Mr. President, it's time we ended this fiasco once and for all. The program already costs tens of billions of dollars more than initial Navy estimates and costs continues to rise. Additionally, we must compare the estimated $73 million cost per plane for the Super Hornet to the $28 million per plane for the Hornet. And, as I have mentioned, some projections put the total program cost of the F/A-18E/F at close to $100 billion. 
   Mr. President, let me briefly highlight the ballooning cost of the Super Hornet. Just a few years ago, the Navy, using overstated assumptions about the total number of planes procured and an estimated annual production rate of 72 aircraft per year, calculated a unit recurring flyaway cost of $44 million. However, using GAO's more realistic assumptions of the procurement of 660 aircraft by the Navy, at a production rate of 36 aircraft per year, the unit recurring flyaway cost of the Super Hornet ballooned to $53 million. Last year, the Navy used more realistic procurement figures of 548 aircraft with annual production at 36 aircraft per year, which brought the unit cost to $73 million. And I am fairly safe in assuming this figure will only rise. This is compared to the $28 million unit recurring flyaway cost for the Hornet. CBO estimates that this cost difference in unit recurring flyaway would result in a savings of almost $15 billion if the Navy were to procure the Hornets rather than the Super Hornets. 
   Mr. President, given the enormous cost and marginal improvement in operational capabilities the Super Hornet would provide, it seems that the justification for it just isn't there. Proceeding with the Super Hornet program may not be the most cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy's tactical aircraft fleet. In the short term, the Navy can continue to procure the Hornet aircraft, while upgrading it to improve further its operational capabilities. For the long term, the Navy can look toward the next generation strike fighter, the JSF, which will provide more operational capability at far less cost than the Super Hornet. 
   Mr. President, by all accounts the F/A-18C/D is a top-quality aircraft that has served the Navy well over the last decade, and could be modified to meet every capacity the E/F is intended to fulfill over the course of the next decade at a substantially lower cost. 
   Therefore, considering the Department of Defense has clearly overextended itself in terms of supporting three major multirole fighter programs, it is clear that we must discontinue the Super Hornet program before the American taxpayer is asked to fund yet another unnecessary, flawed multi-billion dollar program.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The Gaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1999.'' I am pleased to have the Senior Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. KOHL) join me as an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
   Many outside Wisconsin may not know that, in addition to founding Earth Day, Senator Nelson was also the primary sponsor of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Act. That act, which passed in 1970, protects one of Northern Wisconsin's most beautiful areas, at which I spend my vacation with my family every year. 
   Though Senator Nelson has received many awards, I know that among his proudest accomplishments are those bills he crafted which have produced real and lasting change in preserving America's lands, such as the Apostle Islands. 
   The Apostle Islands National Lakshore includes 21 forested islands and 12 miles of pristine shoreline which are among the Great Lakes' most spectacular scenery. Centuries of wave action, freezing, and thawing have sculpted the shorelines, and nature has carved intricate caves into the sandstone which forms the islands. Delicate arches, vaulted chambers, and hidden passageways honeycomb cliffs on the north shore of Devils Island, Swallow Point on Sand Island, and northeast of Cornucopia on the mainland. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore includes more lighthouses than any other coastline of similar size in the United States, and is home to diverse wildlife including: black bear, bald eagles and deer. It is an important recreational area as well. Its campgrounds and acres of forest, make the Apostles a favorite destination for hikers, sailors, kayakers, and bikers. The Lakeshore also includes the underwater lakebed as well, and scuba divers register with the National Park Service to view the area's underwater resources. 
   Unfortunately, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore finds itself, nearly 29 years later, with significant financial and legal resource needs, as do many of the lands managed by the National Park Service. If we are to be true stewards of America's public lands, we need to be willing to make necessary financial investments and management improvements when they are warranted. I introduce this legislation in an attempt to resolve the unfinished business that remains at the Lakeshore, as well as to renew our Nation's commitment to this beautiful place. 
   Mr. President, the legislation has three major sections. First, it authorizes the Park Service to conduct a wilderness suitability study of the Lakeshore as required by the Wilderness Act. 
   This study is needed to ensure that we have the appropriate level of management at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The Wilderness Act and the National Park Service policies require the Park Service to conduct an evaluation of the lands it manages for possible inclusion in the National Wilderness system. The study would result in a recommendation to 
   Congress about whether any of the federally-owned lands currently within the Lakeshore still retain the characteristics that would make them suitable to be legally designated as wilderness. If Congress found the study indicated that some of the federal lands within the Lakeshore were in need of legal wilderness status, Congress would have to subsequently pass legislation to confer such status. 
   We need this study, Mr. President because 28 years have passed and it is time to determine the proper level of management for the Lakeshore. During the General Management Planning Process for the Lakeshore, which was completed nearly a decade ago in 1989, the need for a formal wilderness study was identified. Although a wilderness study has been identified as a high priority by the Lakeshore, it has never been funded. 
   Since 1989, most of the Lakeshore, roughly 80 percent of the acreage, is being managed by the Park Service as if it were federally designated wilderness. As a protective measure, all lands which might be suitable for wilderness designation were zoned to protect any wilderness characteristics they may have pending completion of the study. However, we may be managing lands as wilderness in the Lakeshore that might, due to use patterns, no longer be suitable for wilderness designation. Correspondingly, some land area may have become more ecologically sensitive and may need additional legal protection. 
   Second, this legislation also directs the Park Service to protect the historic Raspberry Island and Outer Island lighthouses. The bill authorizes $3.9 million for bluff stabilization and other necessary actions. There are six lighthouses in the Apostle Island National Lakeshore--Sand Island, Devil's  Island, Raspberry Island, Outer Island, Long Island and Michigan Island. Engineering studies completed for the National Park Service have determined that several of these lighthouses are in danger of structural damage due to the continued erosion of the red clay banks upon which they were built. The situations at Outer Island and Raspberry Island, the two which this legislation addresses, were determined to be in the most jeopardy. 
   Last year, as part of the 1999 Interior Appropriations Bill, $215,000 was provided to the Apostle Island National Seashore for the rehabilitation of the historic lighthouses. While the funding was a commendable first step, it will allow only for preliminary engineering assessments of how to best protect these landmarks. We must go further to ensure that these precious and fragile beacons do not simply crumble into Lake Superior. 
   The Raspberry Island situation is most critical. The Raspberry Island lighthouse was completed in 1863 to make the west channel through the Apostle Islands. The original light was a rectangular frame structure topped by a square tower that held a lens 40 feet above the ground. 
   A fog signal building was added to Raspberry Island in 1902. The red brick structure housed a ten-inch steam whistle and a hoisting engine for a tramway. The need for additional personnel at the station led to a redesign of the lighthouse building in 1906-07. The structure was converted to a duplex, housing the keeper and his family in the east half, with the two assistant keepers sharing the west half. A 23-kilowatt, diesel-driven electric generator was 
   installed at the station in 1928. The light was automated in 1947 and then moved to a metal tower in front of the fog signal building in 1952. 
   Raspberry Island light is now the most frequently visited of Apostle Islands National Lakeshore's lighthouses. Recent erosion is threatening the access tram and the fog signal building. 
   The Outer Island light station was built in 1874 on a red clay bluff 40 feet above Lake Superior. The lighthouse tower stands 90 feet high and the watchroom is encircled by an outside walkway and topped by the lantern. As its name implies, the light is stationed on the outermost island of the Apostle archipelago, fully exposed to Lake Superior's gale-force storms. 
   Historic architects have indicated to the Park Service that Outer Island lighthouse may already be suffering some structural damage due to its location on the bluff and the situation would be much worse if Lake Superior were exceedingly high. 
   Engineers believe that preservation of these structures requires protection of the bluff beneath the lighthouses, stabilization of the banks, and dewatering of the area immediately shoreward of the bluffs. Although the projects have in the past been included within the Park Service-wide construction priorities, they have never been funded. The specific authorization and funding contained in this legislation is essential if the projects are ever to receive the attention they so urgently deserve. 
   In keeping with my belief that progress toward a balanced budget should be maintained, I am proposing that the $4.1 million in authorized spending for the Apostle Islands contained in this legislation be offset by rescinding $10 million in unspent funds from $40 million in funds carried over for the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Program in FY 99 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. The Secretary of the Interior would be required to transfer $5.9 million above the money that it needs to take actions at the Apostle Islands back to the Treasury. 
   Mr. President, I am concerned that we have set aside such a large amount of money for the Clean Coal Technology Program, which the program has been unable to spend, when we have acute appropriations needs at places like the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. 
   Finally, this legislation adds language to the act which created the Lakeshore allowing the Park Service to enter into cooperative agreements with state, tribal, local governments, universities or other non-profit entities to enlist their assistance in managing the Lakeshore. Some parks have specific language in the act which created the park allowing them to enter into such agreements. Parks have used them for activities such as research, historic preservation, and emergency services. Apostle Islands currently does not have this authority, which this legislation adds. 
   Other National Park lands and lands which are managed by the Park Service, such as the Lakeshore, have such authority. Adding that authority to the Lakeshore will be a way to 
   make Lakeshore management resources go farther. The Park Service has the opportunity to carry out joint projects with other partners which could contribute to the management of the Lakeshore including: state, local, and tribal governments, universities, and non-profit groups. Such endeavors would have both scientific management and fiscal benefits. In the past, the Lakeshore has had to forego these opportunities because the specific authority is absent under current law. 
   In his 1969 book on the environment, entitled America's Last Chance, Senator Nelson issued a political challenge:  
   I have come to the conclusion that the number one domestic problem facing this country is the threatened destruction of our natural resources and the disaster which would confront mankind should such destruction occur. There is a real question as to whether the nation, which has spent some two hundred years developing an intricate system of local, State and Federal Government to deal with the public's problems, will be bold, imaginative and flexible enough to meet this supreme test.  
   Though the Apostle Islands are not, because of former Senator Nelson's efforts, ``threatened with destruction,'' they are a fitting place for us to rise to this challenge. I believe that Senator Nelson meant two things by his challenge. Not only did he mean that government must act immediately and decisively to protect resources in crisis, but he also meant that government must be responsible and flexible enough to remain committed to the protection of the areas we wisely seek to preserve under our laws.

   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation regarding Nigeria, a country that stands today astride the border between a repressive history and a potentially productive future. 
   As the Ranking Democrat of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, I have long been concerned about the collapsing economic and political situation in Nigeria. Nigeria, with its rich history, abundant natural resources and wonderful cultural diversity, has the potential to be an important regional leader in West Africa, and the entire African continent. But, sadly, too many of Nigeria's leaders have squandered that potential and the good will of the world with repressive policies, human rights abuses and corruption. 
   The Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999 that I offer today provides a clear framework for U.S. policy toward that troubled West African nation. The Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act declares that the United States should encourage the political, economic and legal reforms necessary to ensure the rule of law and respect for human rights in Nigeria and should aggressively support a timely and effective transition to democratic, civilian government for the people of Nigeria. 
   This bill draws heavily from legislation introduced during the last two Congresses with the leadership of several other distinguished members of Congress. In the 104th Congress, I joined the former chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, Senator Kassebaum, and 20 other Senators in introducing sanctions legislation. In the 105th Congress, I introduced an updated version of that bill, a companion measure of which was introduced in the House by the distinguished chair of the House International Relations Committee, Mr. GILMAN of New York, and a distinguished member of that Committee and of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. PAYNE of New Jersey. I commend the help and assistance of all of my colleagues on this important issue and I appreciate the opportunity to work with them toward the broader goal of a freer Nigeria. 
   Mr. President, the Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act provides by law for many of the sanctions that the United States has had in place against Nigeria for a number of years. It includes a ban on most foreign direct assistance and a ban on the sale of military goods and military assistance to Nigeria, and suggests the reimposition of restriction on visas for top Nigerian officials. But none of these sanctions will be imposed if the President can certify to the Congress that specific conditions, which I will call ``benchmarks,'' regarding the transition to democracy have taken place in Nigeria. These benchmarks include free and fair democratic elections, the release of political prisoners, freedom of the press, continued access for international human rights monitors and the repeal of the many repressive decrees pressed upon the Nigerian people by successive military regimes. 
   This legislation also provides for $37 million in development assistance over three years to support democracy and governance programs and the activities of the U.S. Information Agency, and mandates a larger presence for the U.S. Agency for International Development. I want to emphasize that this bill authorizes no new money. All of these funds would come out of existing USAID and USIA appropriations. 
   Finally, the bill requires the Secretary of State to submit a report on corruption in Nigeria including the evidence of corruption by government officials in Nigeria and the impact of corruption on the delivery of government services in Nigeria, on U.S. business interests in Nigeria, and on Nigeria's foreign policy. It would also require that the Secretary's report include information on the impact on U.S. citizens of advance fee fraud and other fraudulent business schemes originating in Nigeria. 
   The intent of this legislation is two-fold. First, it will continue to send an unequivocal message to whomever is ruling Nigeria that disregard for democracy, human rights and the institutions of civil society in Nigeria is simply unacceptable. Second, the bill provides some direction to the Clinton Administration which had considerable difficulty articulating a coherent policy on Nigeria throughout the Abacha regime, and which, I fear, has too quickly embraced the Abubakar regime despite several important outstanding problems. 
   Nigeria has suffered under military rule for most of its nearly 40 years as an independent nation. By virtue of its size, geographic location, and resource base, it is economically and strategically important both in regional and international terms. Nigeria is critical to American interests. But Nigeria's future was nearly destroyed by the military government of General Sani Abacha. Abacha presided over a Nigeria stunted by rampant corruption, economic mismanagement and the brutal subjugation of its people. 
   Gen. Abacha was by any definition an authoritarian leader of the worst sort. He routinely imprisoned individuals for expressing their political opinions and skimmed Nigeria's precious resources for his own gains and that of his supporters and cronies. He pretended to set a timetable for a democratic transition, but each of the five officially sanctioned parties under his plan ended up endorsing Gen. Abacha as their candidate in what would have been nothing more than a circus referendum on Abacha himself. 
   During the dark days of the Abacha regime, any criticism of the so-called transition process was punishable by five years in a Nigerian prison. Nigerian human rights activists and government critics were commonly whisked away to secret trials before military courts and imprisoned; independent media outlets were silenced; workers' rights to organize were restricted; and the infamous State Security [Detention of Persons] Decree No. 2, giving the military sweeping powers of arrest and detention, remained in force. 
   Perhaps the most horrific example of repression by the Abacha government was the execution of human rights and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others in November 1995 on trumped-up charges. Between the time of that barbaric spectacle and his death, Abacha appeared to be working even harder to tighten its grip on the country, wasting no opportunity to subjugate the people of Nigeria. 
   But with the replacement of Abacha by the current military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, there has been reason to be optimistic about Nigeria's future. Although he has not yet moved to repeal the repressive decrees that place severe restrictions on the basic freedoms of Nigerians, including aforementioned Decree No. 2, Gen. Abubakar has made significant progress in enacting political reforms,  including the establishment of a realistic time line for the transition to civilian rule and guidelines for political participation. According to his transition plan, power will be handed over to a civilian government of May 29, 1999, after a series of elections scheduled for December 5, 1998 (local government), January 9, 1999 (state assembly and governors), February 20 1999 (national assembly) and February 27, 1999 (presidential). Abubakar also agreed to release political prisoners, and some have indeed been released including several prominent individuals. 
   Most Nigerians appear to have embraced this transition program, and many in the international community have welcomed Gen. Abubakar's bold statements. Nevertheless, observers remain apprehensive about the role of the security forces and of the military, perceived weaknesses in the electoral system, the lack of a clear constitutional order, and the possibility of violence during the electoral period. Nigerians also remain concerned about the important questions 
   of federalism and decentralization--including the control and distribution of national wealth--which have yet to be satisfactorily worked out. These concerns, which remain a backdrop to the current transition, tend to dampen what is otherwise a largely optimistic and enthusiastic attitude throughout the country. 
   Thus, as pleased as I am to see the progress being made, I remain cautious about embracing the new dispensation until we can actually see it in place. Adding to my concerns is the disturbing behavior of the military over New Year's weekend in Bayelsa state. According to unconfirmed reports, as many as 100 people may have been killed in the area around Yenagoa, and the military reinforcements have brought in a force of 10,000 to 15,000 troops to the area. The military government also declared as state of emergency for several days. While the circumstances surrounding the crackdown are unclear, it is troubling that--even during this sensitive time of political transition--the Abubakar regime would rely so heavily on hold habits. Minor disturbance? Send in thousands of troops to take care of it! I fear these troops do not know how to ``maintain public order''; rather, they know only how to implement repression. How seriously can we take Abubakar's encouraging statements about political reform, when he continues to use the instruments of repression learned under the Abacha regime? 
   Nigeria's political transition is taking place in the context of economic and political collapse. Nigeria has the potential to be the economic powerhouse on the African continent, a key regional political leader, and an important American trading partner, but it is none of these things. Despite its wealth, economic activity in Nigeria continues to stagnate, Even oil revenues are not what they might be, but they remain the only reliable source of economic growth, with the United States purchasing an estimated 41 percent of the output. 
   Corruption and criminal activity in this military-controlled economic and political system have become common, including reports of drug trafficking and consumer fraud schemes that have originated in Nigeria and reached into the United States, including my home state of Wisconsin. 
   The last time Nigeria appeared posied finally to make a democratic transition, during the 1993 presidential election, the military quickly annulled the results, and promptly put into prision the presumed winner of that eclection Chief Moshood Abiola. 
   Despite numerous domestic and international pleas for his release, he remained in prison until his tragic death in July. Years of neglect and months of solitary confinement took its toll on Chief Abiola, and barely one month after the death of General Abacha, Abiola died of an apparent heart attack during a meeting with senior American officials. 
   It is unfortunate, but Nigeria suffers greatly from the weight of its tortured history. I truly hope the transition currently underway will have better results than previous ones, but we must not let hope and expectation cloud our standards for what is best for Nigeria. I am afraid that the international community, and particularly the Clinton administration, are so quick to reward counties for good behavior, that they then trend to ignore continuing bad behavior. I have noticed this problem in U.S. relations with Indonesia, China, and elsewhere, and it certainly is a concern with Nigeria now. 
   It is in that light that I have decided to reintroduce my bill. This may sound odd, but I actually hope I don't need to pursue this legislation in its current form. I sincerely hope that the transition in Nigeria goes according to all our best wishes, and that there will be no need to impose these sanctions. But if it does not, the spoilers should be aware the U.S. Congress is watching, and will act. This bill provides the means for that action. We cannot let Nigeria spiral down into the quagmire that has overtaken so much of the continent. 
   I have long urged the Administration to take the toughest stance possible in support of democracy in Nigeria. The regime in Nigeria must know that anything less than a transparent transition to civilian rule will be met with severe consequences, including new sanctions as mandated in this bill. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today represents and effort to encourage the best that Nigeria has to offer, to support those Nigerians who have worked tirelessly and fearlessly for democracy and civilian rule and to move our own government toward a Nigeria policy that vigorously reflects the best American values. 
   The provisions of my bill include benchmarks defining what would constitute an open political process in Nigeria. Despite all the tumultuous events that have taken place in these few months. I still believe these benchmarks are important, and I continue to call on Gen. Abubaker to implement as soon as possible these important changes, such as the repeal of the repressive decrees enacted under Abacha's rule, so that genuine reform may flourish in Nigeria.

    Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of opening Senate deliberations to the public during the course of the impeachment trial against President Clinton. I will therefore support the motion to be offered by Senators HARKIN and WELLSTONE to suspend the rules in order to open these proceedings to public scrutiny. 
   In this trial, the United States Senate is charged by the Constitution with deciding whether to remove from office a President twice elected by the American people. Although I am certain that every member of the Senate will undertake this Constitutional responsibility with the utmost gravity and perform ``impartial justice'' as our oath commands, I am concerned that the American people will be shut out of this process at some of its most crucial moments. 
   America's great experiment in democracy trusts the people to elect a President in a process that consists of months of public discussion, primaries, caucuses, debates, and finally an election open to everyone who chooses to participate. In stark contrast, the Senate's rules preclude the public from seeing its deliberations on whether an impeachment case will be dismissed, whether witnesses will be called or further evidence introduced, and even the ultimate debate regarding the guilt or innocence of the President. In short, Mr. President, the Constitution trusts the people to elect a President, but our current Senate impeachment rules do not trust them to have even the most passive involvement in our deliberative process, even when the debate might result in overturning the people's judgment in a national election. 
   Let me take a moment to describe again for my colleagues how our current impeachment rules work. The Senate is not only the trier of fact in this case, but it also acts as the ultimate arbiter of law. It can overturn the Chief Justice's rulings on evidentiary questions and make decisions, which cannot be appealed to any court, on motions. But the Senate's impeachment rules, which were first drafted in connection with the Andrew Johnson impeachment and most recently revisited in 1986, do not permit the Senate to debate any of the decisions that it must make, except in closed session. In fact, the rules provide that decisions on evidentiary rulings are to be made with no debate whatsoever. 
   Other motions can be debated, but only in private. So, for example, we expect that after the presentations are made on both sides, a motion will be made to dismiss the case against the President. Under our current rules, the House managers and the President's lawyers will argue that motion, but the Senate cannot debate it in open session. In fact, if a majority of the Senate wants to preclude debate entirely, it can do that by simply voting against a motion to take the Senate into private session for deliberations. Thus, before we vote on what could be a dispositive motion in this case, our only options are to discuss it behind closed doors or not discuss it at all. 
   I think this is wrong. We need a chance to debate this motion as Senators. I want to hear from my colleagues before I vote, not just afterward on television. I intend to carefully and respectfully entertain my colleagues' arguments, and I refuse to rule out the possibility that a well-reasoned argument offering a different perspective will influence my decision. But the American people also deserve to hear what we say to each other as we debate this motion. I see little to be gained from closing these deliberations and much to be lost. We must do everything we can to ensure public confidence in our fairness and impartiality. How can we expect the public to have faith in us if we close the doors at the very moment when we finally will speak on the dispositive questions of this historic trial? 
   Opponents of openness argue that in the only Presidential impeachment trial in our nation's history, that of Andrew Johnson, the Senate's deliberations were closed. 
   While it may be tempting to rely on the precedent of the one previous Presidential impeachment trial, which occurred one-hundred and thirty years ago, I believe we should take a fresh look at this issue. In particular, we should consider how drastically the rules of the Senate and the composition of the Senate have changed. 
   The Senators who presided over President Johnson's impeachment were not elected by the American people directly, but were chosen by the various state legislatures, and thus were not directly responsive to the popular will. Today, we as Senators represent the citizens of our state directly and we are accountable to them at the ballot box. Furthermore, until 1929, the Senate debated nominations and treaties in closed sessions; and until 1975, many committee sessions took place in private. Today, all of our proceedings are open to the public, except in rare cases involving national security. The rules governing membership in the Senate as well as the openness of Senate proceedings have consistently evolved  throughout our history toward greater public involvement. The rules governing impeachment trial deliberations must move in that direction as well. 
   Opening these proceedings as Senators HARKIN and WELLSTONE have proposed will make the American public feel more involved in the process. With the percentage of voters who cast their ballot on election day declining in each succeeding election and polls showing that the public feels increasingly alienated from the political process; and with people openly questioning the relevance of their elected representatives and the Congress as a whole to their daily lives, we must lay open to the American people our deliberations on the most crucial decision short of declaring war that the Constitution ultimately entrusts to us. Democracy can only flourish when the people feel that they have a stake in the process. Conducting our impeachment deliberations in private sends the message that when the really important decisions need to be made, the American public is not welcome to observe. This is precisely the wrong message to send. 
   Thus far in the impeachment process, there has been little to celebrate. Most Americans have concluded that the House of Representative's inquiry was plagued by partisanship. Many fear that the Senate will do the same. With the eyes of the country upon it, the Senate has an opportunity to restore America's trust in the constitutional process. Open deliberations will enhance the public's understanding and discussion of this case. It may even serve to chip away some of the pervasive cynicism in our country as Americans watch how their elected representatives conduct themselves during consideration of the articles. I trust that my colleagues will reach their decisions on the merits after careful, reasoned and informed consideration of the evidence and the arguments presented. If my trust in my colleagues is justified, our deliberations will be thoughtful, high-minded, vigorous, and non-partisan. And if we have that deliberation in the open, it will be remembered as one of the Senate's finest hours.
