Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise to make remarks concerning the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act to provide compassionate payments to hemophiliac victims of the blood supply crisis of the 1980s. The House passed the bill last May; unfortunately the Senate may not be able to pass a bill this year. The tragedy of the blood supply's infection has brought unbearable pain to families all over the country. I have heard from hundreds of these individuals and families over the past months, and I had hoped this bill would bring some closure to the grief of thousands of families who have suffered because of the blood crisis of the 1980s. 
I am saddened, however, that the bill that passed the House acknowledged fewer than half the victims of the blood supply crisis. Along with Senators Warner and Faircloth, I have fought to include victims of transfusion-associated AIDS in the bill this year. They are victims of the same blood supply crisis and are just as deserving of acknowledgment and compassion from the federal government. 
I cannot overstate my disappointment, and I can only imagine their pain. This is a group of people that has suffered a great tragedy. In their minds, in the minds of the hemophiliac community, and in the minds of members who have advocated for the Ricky Ray bill, the federal government played a role in the tragedy. It would be bad enough for the federal government to never step forward and acknowledge the tragedy, but passing a bill without them would have been the worst kind of affront. We would have acknowledged the tragedy, but ignored the distress it has brought to this particular community. 
With commitment from a few of my key colleagues that we would pass a bill for transfusion-associated AIDS cases next year, I supported passage of H.R. 1023. I want to take this opportunity to discuss some of the background of the bill and the reasons that I have fought so hard to include the transfusion-associated AIDS community in the Ricky Ray bill this year. 
While financial need and simple compassion for the tragedy suffered may be two reasons of many to pass this bill, these reasons alone cannot justify government payments to victims of the blood supply. The bill is heavily rooted in the belief that in the early to mid-1980s the government failed to protect users of the blood supply. The record that has been built in the Senate in floor speeches and in testimony provided at the Labor Committee hearing reflects this reason above all others for passing this bill. 
Last October the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources held a hearing on `HIV/AIDS: Recent Developments and Future Opportunities.' A good portion of that hearing was devoted to a discussion on the blood crisis of the 1980s, resulting in the HIV infection of thousands of Americans who trusted that the blood or blood products with which they were treated was safe. Witnesses at the hearing included John Williams, the father of a child who contracted HIV from the clotting factor and died at the age of 18, and Donna McCullough, a young woman who contracted HIV when she received a blood transfusion after a miscarriage. 
Several witnesses at the hearing, including my colleagues Senator Mike DeWine and Congressman Porter Goss, testified that the federal government played a role in bringing on this tragedy and therefore owes this expression of compassion to the community affected. 
Witnesses testified that the federal government is the watchdog charged with protecting the blood supply and that the government failed to respond aggressively to the early signs of blood borne diseases. The government did not do all it could have done to screen donors and test blood. The government failed to recall potentially contaminated blood and blood products; and then, knowing that transfusion of HIV-infected blood and blood products led to HIV infection, knowing that some of the blood was contaminated, and knowing that people were using it, the government still failed to notify people who were at risk. The details of the government's role were outlined in an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report published in 1995.

Mr. JEFFORDS. The Springfield region of Vermont currently faces a crisis in the machine tool industries. Six major machine tool employers in the area indicate that more than 50 percent of their workforce will retire within the next five to seven years. This will create the need for highly skilled employees to fill more than 700 positions in machine technology. In addition, other employers in the areas of information technology, hospitality and travel, financial services and food services industries indicate that they have an urgent need for a responsive education delivery system designed to meet their growing demand for skilled labor. I understand that the conference report includes funds for the Springfield Workforce Development Center to implement innovative training and vocational education strategies to meet the education, workforce and economic development needs of the region.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear neighbor and lifetime friend. Vincent D'Acuti passed away on September 23th. However, his sense of humor and his devotion to his community will keep him in the hearts and minds of those who knew and loved him. 
Often called `Mr. South Burlington,' Vincent served his community in a variety of ways. He was a selectman in South Burlington for 10 years during the transition from town to city in the 1970's. While he was on the board, the population doubled and numerous improvement projects were undertaken. He was on the Burlington International Airport Commission, helped form the Burlington Boys and Girls Club, and was an active member of the Kiwanis club for over fifty years. He was a fixture at the annual pancake breakfast and charity auction run by the Kiwanis, served as their lieutenant governor for New England, and received a national Kiwanis award for 50 years of service. 
He also served his country in the army, including a stint in Normandy. While stationed at Fort Ethan Allen in Colchester, he met his future wife, Lillian Langlois of South Burlington. After he was discharged, he returned to the Burlington area to work and raise his family. 
Vincent approached his service of both country and community with a sense of humor which endeared himself to everyone he met. As I read the article in the September 34th edition of The Burlington Free Press, I was struck at how many people mentioned this attribute. Frank Balch, a former employer of Vincent said, `He loved his life and enjoyed it to the hilt. He was an unforgettable person.' He loved to tell stories and most of them were about his wife and two daughters. The joy which Vincent shared with others grew from the joy he found with his wife their daughters, Donna and Diane. 
My wife Liz recalled a time when she was babysitting for his children. There was a huge storm, and as is typical in rural Vermont, the power went out. Liz wasn't expecting Vince or Lillian to be home for hours, so when she heard someone at the back door, she grabbed a vacuum cleaner and positioned herself by the door, ready to defend herself and Vince's two daughters. However, the mysterious noise she heard was Vince returning home early from his work as owner of the local Dairy Queen. Luckily, he said hello before my wife wacked him over the head with the Hoover! 
Through his commitment to his community, his friends, and his family, he showed us how one man can truly make a difference in the lives of others. Through his humor and charisma he showed us all how to live life to its fullest. Farewell Vincent. Your friendship meant a great deal to me, and to so many others whose lives you touched.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good neighbor and a man who was the best of the best. His name is Peter J. Carrara and he passed away suddenly on August 20th. However, he will be remembered by everyone who knew him as the epitome of good humor and optimism. Or as co-workers put it, `If you didn't like Peter, you didn't like life.' 
Peter was a man who loved his country and dreamed of serving the US Navy since he was a child. He fulfilled his dream, served with honor, and became a highly decorated officer. In fact, he retired in 1992 with the rank of Senior Chief Yeoman on a Ballistic Missile Nuclear Submarine, one of the greatest accomplishments a Navy man can achieve. For his service he was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, five Navy Achievement medals, five Good Conduct Medals, Enlisted Submarine Breast Insignia, and the SSBN Deterrent Patrol Insignia. Following his retirement, he held several jobs, including second constable for the Town of Shrewsbury for the last four years of his life. 
In addition to serving his country, Peter served his community in many ways. He was a member of the Shrewsbury Community Church, Rutland Fleet Reserve Association, American Legion Post 31, the Shrewsbury So-Birds, and a volunteer fireman. He would approach any situation, especially challenging ones, with a calmness and strength which was reassuring to everyone around him. To quote his fellow town constable, `He could approach hostile people as if he knew the angel of God was on his shoulder.' 
As I read through the eulogies given and letters written about Peter, I was struck by how many people mentioned his kindness, caring, and compassion for others. Friends praised and remembered his big heart and giving spirit. For example, when he worked for UPS, he stayed late one Christmas Eve so families would have their presents for the next day. He was devoted to his friends and family and would do anything for them. When they were sick in the hospital, he would visit with them and bring them great comfort. 
In fact, his ability to comfort and bring a smile to people's face will be how Peter is remembered. My wife Liz said, `You could never feel down around Peter. His smile and warmth picked your spirits up and you went on your way smiling.' But the biggest tribute came from a childhood friend. `You were my hero. I really enjoyed growing up with you, and today you are still my hero.' 
Farewell, Peter. You will truly be missed.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to report to my colleagues that yesterday afternoon a tentative agreement on home health care was reached by negotiators from the House and the Senate. This agreement will throw a much needed lifeline to our Nation's senior citizens who rely on home health care to provide much needed health services within the surroundings of their homes. 
Home health care is the cornerstone of the health care safety net for senior citizens. It spares them the dislocation of moving to a hospital or nursing home, and it spares the taxpayers from paying for such costly services when they are not really needed. 
The administration has implemented reductions in home health care services that treat every agency exactly the same, regardless of whether the agency is efficient or wasteful. The result is that the most efficient agencies are being hit with cuts they cannot absorb. Vulnerable senior citizens in my State are on the brink--on the brink--of losing their vital services. 
Under the proposal, payments to the older, low-cost home health agencies will be increased and an additional 15 percent across-the-board cut scheduled for next fall will be delayed for 6 months. That is the time when they say the proposed payments which will get us out of this mess will be available. Adoption of this bill will give home health agencies needed financial relief until a new prospective payment system is in place. 
All we need now is for the administration to also agree to help our senior citizens who rely on home health care, as was wrapped into the omnibus bill yesterday. I call upon the President in the strongest way I possibly can to join us in saving hundreds and thousands of home health care services from being forced to cut back on critical services. 
Today is a day of political spinning. The media will examine who won and who lost, what provisions are in and what provisions are out. We must take that time to make things right for senior citizens who need our help. 
Over the last 8 months, I have been working as hard as I know how to find a solution for the crisis faced by our home health care agencies in Vermont. Our 13 home health agencies are model agencies that provide high-quality, comprehensive home health care with a low price tag. However, under Medicare's new interim payment system, the payments to the agency are so low that Vermont seniors may be denied access to needed home health services. They are the lowest cost in the whole United States. 
For the past 7 years, the average Medicare expenditures for home health care in Vermont have been the lowest in the Nation. However, rather than being rewarded for this cost-effective system, Vermont has been penalized by the implementation of the current interim payment system. In June 1998, Vermont's home health agencies projected the statewide impact of their current interim payment system was a loss of over $4.5 million in Medicare revenues for the first year. These are nonprofit agencies in our little State. This represents a loss of over 11 percent on an annual base of $40 million statewide. 
Vermont is a good example of how the health care system can work to provide for high-quality care for Medicare beneficiaries. Home health agencies are a critical link in the kind of health system that extends care over a continuum of options and settings. New technology and advances in medical practice permit hospitals to discharge patients earlier. They give persons suffering with acute or chronic illness the opportunity to receive care and live their lives in familiar surroundings. Time and time again, Vermont's home health agencies have proven their value by providing quality, cost-effective services to these patients. Yet, time and time again, Federal policy seems to ensure that their good deeds will go punished. 
The home health legislation is the product of a great deal of hard work by the majority leader, Senators Roth and Gramm, and Congressmen Thomas and Bilirakis. I worked with them yesterday before we reached our conclusion. The signing of this bill will mark a victory for our State and also reflect a strong nationwide commitment to high-quality, cost-effective home health agencies such as those in Vermont. 
I anguish as I wait today to know what will happen at the White House. I ask the President, call upon him, to make sure that they do not destroy this wonderful work that was accomplished yesterday to save our home health care system.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the passage of S. 1754, the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998. This legislation reauthorizes the health care training programs contained in titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act and its enactment will improve health workforce quality, diversity, and the distribution of funds--while requiring greater accountability of both the grant recipients of federal funds and the agency that administers them. I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Act. 
Senate bill 1754 reauthorizes and consolidates 37 categorical grant and contract authorities of title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act into 8 clusters to provide for the support of health professions training programs and related community-based educational partnerships. To preserve the integrity of the programs, 15 funding lines will continue. This legislation provides comprehensive, flexible, and effective authority for the support of health professions training programs and the related community-based educational partnerships. 
In my own State of Vermont, the students of the University of Vermont's College of Medicine have benefited from a number of these programs and scholarships, including those relating to family medicine and professional nurse and nurse practitioner training. The newest title VII program in Vermont is the Area Health Education Center (AHEC) which opened its first site in April 1997 in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. The AHEC will decentralize health professions education by having portions of the training provided in primary medical personnel shortage areas and by improving the coordination and use of existing health resources. Over the next two years, two additional sites are planned in other underserved areas of the State. These efforts have contributed to making Vermont a better place to obtain health care services and they have improved the quality of life for its residents. 
I want to thank Senator Frist and his excellent staff for their dedication and hard work in drafting the Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998. The enactment of this act will improve the training of our nation's health workforce and, also, provide for greater accountability of the public funds used to support these educational programs.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we must pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998 in this Congress. 
It seems like so long ago that when we introduced bill, I remember Bob Dole, who has been a hero with disabilities over the years being a disabled man himself, coming forward to us with this legislation, or to help on this legislation, and told his life story, and how incredibly important it was for him as an individual to be able to get back into the workforce. As we all know, he did that so successfully. 
I am now watching carefully as we struggle to come to the end of this session, and know that one of the bills that is lying there waiting to be passed is the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998 on which the former Senator, Leader Dole, worked so hard. 
This legislation addresses the last remaining barrier to true independence for individuals with disabilities. We must act now. For years, both here and in Vermont, individuals with disabilities have said to me, `Senator Jeffords, I want to work. But I cannot afford to.' 
It took me a while to fully understand and appreciate what they were saying. Simply put, the current system of cash payments and health care coverage in the Social Security Act do not encourage individuals with disabilities to work, or to work to their full potential. 
Common sense is on our side with regard to Social Security reform. Our country has succeeded in providing Federal and State support for children and adults with disabilities through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and recently the Work Investment Act of 1998. 
But although our Nation has shown its commitment to prepare children and adults with disabilities for work--in fact, in the work incentive bill I referred to, we have the Rehabilitation Act reauthorization there; we put it in the Workforce Act to bring closure, to bring together all of these bills that help people to work--we have conditions that, unfortunately, do not allow or encourage those individuals with disabilities to work. 
If someone told you, `Look, you can work, but if you earn over $500 monthly, in 12 months'--that is $6,000 a year--`your health insurance will stop, unless you pay for it yourself,' after a period of time would you work and exceed those thresholds? I doubt it. 
If someone told you, `We will cover the cost of personal assistance services and prescription drugs that you need in order to work, but you cannot have more than $2,000 in assets, or accumulate more than $2,000 in assets,' do these conditions appear to help individuals be self-sufficient? Clearly not. 
The facts are on the side of those of us who want to pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998. We want it included in the omnibus appropriations bill, and there is great effort going on to accomplish that. 
There are 7.5 million individuals with disabilities who receive cash payments from the Social Security Administration and receive health insurance coverage through Medicare or Medicaid. According to GAO, in 1996 cash payments were about $1.21 billion weekly. These payments do not include payments made under Medicare or Medicaid. If these payments are factored in, the costs exceed $70 billion annually. 
It has been estimated that the number of Social Security beneficiaries with disabilities increased 83 percent between 1989 and 1997, and this number will continue to grow by a rate of about 3 to 6 percent a year. 
If just 1 percent of these beneficiaries were to become successfully employed, savings in cash payments would total $3.5 billion over their lifetime for that 1 percent. The Work Incentives Improvement Act is a credible, viable solution in terms of both fiscal responsibility and personal responsibility. 
The Work Incentives Improvement Act gives States discretion to offer health care benefits to individuals with disabilities on the Social Security rolls when their earned income exceeds that now in the Social Security Act. As a result, more of these individuals will work and will work for more hours. 
The legislation allows States to impose cost-sharing obligations on these individuals. The legislation would cost $200 million a year over a 5-year period--a small price to pay when you consider this legislation has a potential to turn 8 million individuals into taxpayers. There ought to be a substantial gain--no cost. The legislation includes offsets to pay for it. 
The legislation includes Representative Bunning's `Ticket to Work' bill that will give people with disabilities more choices when they need job training before going to work. 
All major disabilities organizations support the Work Incentives Improvement Act but will not support the enactment of the `Ticket to Work' alone. They have to come together. 
Many of our colleagues in the administration support this legislation. I especially want to thank my friend Senator Grassley for his support in these important last weeks. 
The insurance industry fully supports the legislation. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will help reduce the $70 billion annual drain on the budget caused by 8 million individuals with disabilities, many of whom want to work but do not because of their fear of the loss of access to health care. 
At this point we cannot say, again, we will try to get something through next Congress. We cannot hide behind excuses. We must pass the Work Incentives Improvement Act now. This is a special time. The momentum is with us. People with disabilities expect us to deliver now. They want to be free to go to work. 
If we do, the lives of millions of Americans will be transformed, both disabled and nondisabled Americans. Individuals with disabilities will work and pay taxes. They will experience the true meaning of personal dignity, freedom, independence, and choices. Their family members and friends will be freed from caretaking responsibilities and reenter the workforce or expand their work hours. Decisions about the quality of life and living circumstances of an individual with disabilities will no longer be made for that individual but will be made by and with that individual. 
The only down side to the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998 is it has taken us so long to get to this precious moment. Let's make it count. Let us deliver, and let us deliver now. 
Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have and I am now ready to proceed. 
I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Hospital and Regional Office Center of White River Junction, Vermont. October 16 marks this facility's sixtieth anniversary. For six decades it has provided compassionate, high-quality service to Vermont and New Hampshire Veterans. 
On October 16, 1938, an elaborate dedication ceremony was held in White River Junction at the newly completed VA hospital. The next day, the first patient was admitted. In an unusual move, the regional VA office relocated its offices from Burlington to the White River Junction location to better serve veterans in processing their claims for benefits. The facility gradually grew over the years. By the end of World War II, 26 `Quonset' huts had to be erected to provide space for the rapidly expanding veterans programs, increasing the hospital's capacity to 250 beds. 
In 1946, the VA hospital entered into an agreement with Dartmouth Medical School to become a teaching hospital, an arrangement that continues and thrives today. Recognizing the importance of research programs, in 1954, the VA, in partnership with Dartmouth Medical School, launched a medical research initiative. The research function was significantly expanded in 1992 with the completion of a research and education facility that enabled the hospital to perform medical and health services research, rehabilitation and cooperative studies. In addition to these critical fields of study, this facility is helping veterans make more informed choices about their medical treatment through cutting edge outcomes research. 
From 1971 through 1981, several construction projects were undertaken to modernize and expand the hospital. In 1989, the VA began its venture of providing community-based outreach centers (CBOCs) to meet veterans' primary care needs in locations closer to their homes. A outreach clinic was opened in Burlington, and based on the success of this project, a community clinic was opened in Bennington earlier this year. 
The White River Junction VA center has also done an exemplary job of meeting more than just the veterans' health care needs. Vermont veterans are also very fortunate to have, under the same roof, a very capable group of people to assist them with their benefit needs. The staff is small but mighty when its comes to their advocacy for veterans and I greatly appreciate the assistance they have provided Vermont veterans, for more than half a century, as well as to my office for the past 20 years. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to publicly thank all of the unsung heroes associated with this tremendous facility. They know who they are--the director of this facility, Gary DeGasta; the dedicated staff at the hospital and regional office; the Veterans Service Organizations who donate so much time and money to help provide for veterans; and, of course, the veterans, who for 60 years have supported the mission of this fine facility with their continuous patronage. 
To my friends at the VA in White River Junction--Happy Anniversary. May you have many more.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, over the past several days, the White House has bombarded the airwaves with rhetoric suggesting that congressional Republicans have turned a deaf ear to the needs of our nation's students. Hearing all this, I have to say I feel like I have entered a parallel universe. Less than one week ago, I was standing in that same White House listening to the President laud one of the most significant bipartisan achievements of the 105th Congress--enactment of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
Lost in all the pre-election maneuvering is any recognition of the solid record of accomplishment by this Congress on behalf of students from pre-school through graduate school. I would like to take a few minutes to review that record.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the conference report on the Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1998 includes the Head Start program, the Community Services Block Grant, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Through this reauthorization, these programs can continue to provide vital assistance to the neediest of Americans. The Assets for Independence Act, also included in this bill, is a new way of helping low-income individuals and families to achieve economic self-sufficiency. 
For three decades, Head Start, CSBG, and LIHEAP have effectively helped many low-income families and individuals throughout America. In this legislation, we have used the lessons learned over the past thirty years to reaffirm what is working well, make improvements where necessary to better meet today's challenges, and eliminate what no longer achieves our goals. 
This bill leaves present law largely intact, but it does make some important changes to improve program accountability, expand services to meet the changing needs of today's families, and to increase the capacity of these programs to reach each of the program's purposes. 
The reauthorization of Head Start expands the Early Head Start program for our youngest children, in a manner which balances the desire to make this program available to more children and families and the need to ensure that every Head Start program meets the high standards of quality that we have demanded. 
The new evaluation and research provisions will provide much-needed information about how the program operates, help identify the `best practices,' and will guide the grantees, the Department of Health and Human Services, and Congress to continue the improvements in Head Start which began four years ago. 
This legislation expands the Head Start competitive grant process to include for-profit service providers. All Head Start grantees must meet the same high level of performance standards and outcome measures. Tax status does not guarantee the quality of a program---good or bad,. The most important issue is selecting the best possible provider, non-profit or for-profit, public or private, to deliver Head Start services. That is what this legislation does. 
The second major program authorized under this legislation is the Community Services Block Grant, or CSBG. This program provides funding to States for work in local communities to alleviate the causes of poverty. That's an easily defined goal, but getting there takes lots of work, and diverse communities across the nation are taking equally as diverse approaches to meeting it. 
Local Community Action Agencies, working with other groups and individuals in their communities, are helping people find and keep a job. They are helping them go back to school or get their GED. Provisions in this legislation will help States and local communities to continue this important work. 
For almost two decades, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) has provided a lifeline to countless Americans who cannot pay their fuel bills. The program works very well. It is widely regarded as a model block grant program that gives states the flexibility to meet the needs of their low-income residents while ensuring an appropriate level of accountability for federal dollars. 
The reauthorization of LIHEAP will help about four million low-income, disabled, and elderly households pay their fuel bills so they won't have to struggle to keep warm in the winter or to avoid heatstroke in the summer. They won't be forced to choose between heating and eating. Although some four million households received LIHEAP benefits this year, if we had the resources, some 30 million households would be eligible for LIHEAP assistance. This legislation establishes an authorization level that will permit Congress to increase funding for LIHEAP, a goal towards which I will continue to work. 
I know some of our colleagues in Congress wonder whether we still need a LIHEAP program. Today I think we send a strong message that the program is more important than ever, especially in light of welfare reform efforts. Low- and fixed-income households still spend at least 18 percent of their income on energy bills, a proportion virtually unchanged since LIHEAP was created. 
The Assets for Independence Act represents an important new approach to helping low-income families and individuals. Through Individual Development Accounts, the saving, investment, and accumulation of assets is encouraged as a way to increase economic self-sufficiency and build a future. Senator Coats crafted this portion of the legislation. His work in the development of asset-based policies to help low-income individuals and families has helped us approach an old problem from a new angle. 
Senator Coats took the lead in shepherding this bill through the legislative process, from the first draft to the conference report. When the Committee on Labor and Human Resources marked-up the bill, they unanimously voted to change the name of the legislation to the Coats Act as a tribute to Senator Coats' dedication to issues affecting children and their families. 
In both his personal and professional life, Senator Coats has been a longstanding activist on behalf of American families. He was a Big Brother in Indiana long before his political career began, and was recently elected President of the Board of Directors for Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America. Early in his congressional career, Senator Coats served as the Republican leader for the House Select Committee on Children, Youth And Families. 
Upon arriving in the Senate in 1989, he became the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Children and Families of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Serving as the subcommittee's Chairman since 1995, Senator Coats has been a voice of reason and a tireless advocate for children and families. 
His compassion and caring is evident in every piece of legislation that has come out of that subcommittee since Senator Coats became a member. When he leaves the Senate, I will miss his leadership and most of all, his friendship. 
The Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act will serve to remind us all of his contributions to the Labor Committee and the Senate. 
This legislation is the result of months of hard work, negotiation, and compromise. It has been a truly bi-partisan, bicameral effort that has resulted in good public policy. 
The legislation reinforces what works in these programs, and discards what does not, which is the whole purpose of a reauthorization. 
It continues the mission that we began many years ago of empowering communities to help their most vulnerable populations, and it does this in a responsible manner. This bi-partisan effort would not have been possible without the hard work of many outstanding staff members. 
With this legislation, Stephanie Monroe, the Staff Director for the Subcommittee on Children and Families, has added one more piece of effective public policy to her already impressive portfolio. Her work in researching, drafting, and negotiating this bill has been invaluable. Stephanie has been working in the Senate for fourteen years and I hope she will seriously consider continuing on here, after Senator Coats retires. 
I want to thank Stephanie Robinson and Amy Lockhart, of Senator Kennedy's staff and Suzanne Day and Jim Fenton of Senator Dodd's staff for their contributions and their commitment to keeping this legislation a bi-partisan effort. 
Conferencing a bill always involves long hours, hard work, and much patience. I appreciate the efforts of Denzel McGuire, Mary Gardner Clagett, and Sally Lovejoy on the staff of the House Committee on Education and Workforce. 
I also want to thank Jackie Cooney of Senator Gregg's staff, Alex Nock and Marcy Phillips with Representative Martinez, Melanie Marola with Representative Castle, Amy Adair and Randy Brant with Representative Souder for their work on this legislation. 
Brian Jones recently left my staff on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, but before he left, he contributed enormously to the crafting of this legislation. I wish him well in his new venture, and appreciate his contributions to this and other legislation while on my staff. Geoff Brown, who is on my personal staff was instrumental in crafting and negotiating the LIHEAP portion of the bill. Working with Cameron Taylor, Legislative Director of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coaltion, Geoff made sure that this critical program will continue to meet the needs of millions of low-income families. 
Kimberly Barnes-O'Connor provided valuable and tireless counsel throughout this process, proving once again her capacity to put the interests of children and families first. I commend her for her exemplary service to me, the committee, the Congress, and the constituents we serve through these critical human services programs. 
Mark Powden, the Staff Director for the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, as always, helped to clear the obstacles and push this legislation forward. Thank you, Mark. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Coats, who is worthy of all the praise possible with respect to this legislation and his total service to this Nation.

<DOCNO>105-jeffords-vt-2-19981008</DOCNO>

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will make a few comments on the vocational education bill at this time. 
Today we are considering the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. 
This is one of the most important proposals we will consider in the 105th Congress. In July, we passed the Workforce Investment Act. The reauthorization of vocational education is an important partner to the Workforce Investment Act. 
There are presently between 200,000 and 300,000 unfilled positions in the technology field. The reason for the difficulty in filling these positions is not because of low unemployment numbers, but because of the lack of skilled workers. Many of these jobs do not require four years and plus of postsecondary education. They do require an excellent vocational education system and the ability to pursue further technical education following high school education. 
One of the most fascinating facts to come out of the Senate Labor Committee's hearings on vocational education, was that Malaysia has replicated our Tech Prep model. Tech Prep was created in this country and we have many model Tech Prep programs, but not as many as we should have. Malaysia realized Tech Prep was a key answer to improving their skilled workforce and they have put the resources behind it to make it very successful. 
The 1998 vocational education reauthorization strengthens the Tech Prep program by emphasizing the importance of the business community as a partner with the education sector. 
The United States is the most productive country in the world, but we are losing our edge to other industrialized nations such as Japan and Germany as well as other rapidly developing countries such as Taiwan, Korea, and China. 
Over the past 25 years, the standard of living for those Americans without at least a four year postsecondary degree has plunged. In the next decade, we are in danger of being surpassed as the world's foremost economic power if we don't begin to redefine our priorities at the national, state, and local levels. 
Our international competitors have been leaders in making the important connection between education and work. 
Last year, a report released by the National Center for Research in Vocational Education, a report which I requested as part of the 1990 vocational education reauthorization, highlighted the importance of a cohesive partnership between educators and employers. Employers are active participants in the governance of work-related education and training in Australia, Great Britain, France, and Germany. 
Another significant finding of the report was that European nations, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, are attempting to develop a technical education system that can serve as either a bridge to additional vocational training or pursuing college level courses. 
This reauthorization package emphasizes the important balance between a strong academic background and a vocational and technical education system that reflects today's global economy. 
The 1998 reauthorization also requires the states and local communities to set-up an accountability system which will give us a visual picture of how states and local communities are implementing vocational and technical education programs. Most importantly, how these programs are impacting vocational and technical education students. 
I would like to thank my colleagues on the Senate Labor Committee and the staff, especially the Congressional Research Staff and the legislative counsel staff who have all put in countless hours on this bill which is an excellent foundation for the 21st century workforce. 
I thank my colleagues on the Senate Labor Committee and the staff, especially the Congressional Research staff and the legislative counsel staff who all put in countless hours on this bill which is an excellent foundation for the 21st century workforce. I also commend the members of my committee, certainly, but also the Members of the House. We are bringing this to a close just at the end of the session. For a long period of time, it looked like we would not be here, but we are. I thank Chairman Goodling, in particular, and Congressman Buck McKeon for their tremendous help in bringing this to fruition.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I was proud to submit S. Res. 207 on April 2nd of this year, and I am very pleased to mark its adoption tonight. 
Tonight's action by the Senate is but one small step to redress the very reason why the founders of the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) felt compelled to take action 20 years ago. In 1978, Vietnam Veterans were suffering under the wave of anti-Vietnam sentiment that had swept the nation. Little recognition was given to their sacrifices during the war. And in fact, there was even a great deal of official denial about the extent of the price that had been paid by these veterans, both physical and emotional. For instance, it would be years before Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder was a recognized condition for many veterans and before the Federal Government admitted that our use of Agent Orange had left a terrible legacy of continued suffering for our veterans. The founders of the VVA felt that they needed an organization to speak directly to those needs. The outpouring of enthusiasm from the veterans themselves demonstrated the depth of these feelings. 
I am also very proud that Chapter One was founded in my home town of Rutland, Vermont. Vermonters have maintained a prominent voice in the organization, and are active in defining its future direction. 
The VVA is not focused just on the three decades behind us. It continues to look to the large challenges ahead both for veterans as a group and Vietnam Veterans in particular. Just as the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a permanent reminder of the sacrifices of the past, the VVA will be a continual voice for pragmatism and commitment to the needs of the veteran.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me first join my good friend from Oklahoma in his accolades for Senator Bumpers. I expect that I, as a Republican, probably supported some of Senator Bumpers' pieces of legislation more than any other Republican. And I had an opportunity to work with him on many that were not popular with some of the people, especially in the far West. But I point out that I have enjoyed so much working with him, especially on things which most all of us agreed on, as the preservation of Civil War sites and other of our historical aspects which are so important to this Nation. 
I am going to be so sorry to see him leave. We had many wonderful times together. And I expect we will have some more out in his great State.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael S. Daley who is retiring from over 30 years as an orderly at Fletcher Allen Hospital in Burlington, Vermont. Michael joined the hospital in the late 1960's and began his career as a health care worker. After a few years, he thought he would try his luck in California. He soon realized that Vermont was where he wanted to be. He rejoined the workers at the hospital in October 1970 and continued to be a care giver in every sense of the word. Michael is my wife, Liz's, bother. I can not count the number of times Vermonters' have come up to me to tell me how kind Michael had been to them when they were ill or injured. 
Being an orderly was more than a job to Michael. It was a vocation. He was ever mindful of the importance of medical care, however, he never neglected the soul. Every one of his co-workers would tell you that Michael brought a sense of humor to everything he did. He would often bring his lunch to a patient's room and visit during this lunch break. Doctors, new to the O.R. or leaving for other assignments, were regularly treated to lunches prepared by Michael in their honor. `Michael knows everyone', a co-worker stated. I think that Michael made it his business to get to know everyone. He would note when someone from our hometown of Shrewsbury, Vermont was hospitalized and he would pay them a visit. If a person wanted to talk, Michael would be there. 
Michael is a religious man who lives his faith. His work in the Episcopal church in Milton, Vermont kept that small community alive for years. Along with his wife, Alice, and their three children, Michael is and has been very active in Saint Andrews Church in Colchester, Vermont. His faith has helped Michael go the extra mile in the care and comfort of his fellow Vermonters. His sense of humor has added sunshine to the lives of those he meets. Michael represents the millions of unsung heros who care for and comfort our neighbors, family and friends. I wish to honor him and his life's work.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will eliminate unnecessary distinctions drawn by the Internal Revenue Code for the tax treatment of payments received by families and individuals who open their homes to care for foster children and adults. Currently, the law allows an exclusion from income for foster care payments received by some providers, while denying eligibility for the exclusion to other foster care providers. 
My bill expands the law's exclusion of foster care payments. Under my bill, foster care payments to providers made by placement agencies that contract with, or are licensed by, State or local governments will be eligible for the exclusion, regardless of the age of the individual in foster care. This bill is a companion to H.R. 3991, introduced by Congressman Jim Bunning of Kentucky. By simplifying the tax treatment of foster care payments, the bill will remove the inequities and uncertainties inherent in the current tax treatment of foster care payments. 
Under current law, foster care providers are permitted to deduct expenditures made while caring for foster individuals. Providers must maintain detailed records to substantiate these deductions. In lieu of this detailed record keeping, section 131 of the Internal Revenue Code allows certain foster care providers to exclude from income the payments they receive to care for foster care. Eligibility for this exclusion depends upon a complicated analysis of three factors: the age of the person in foster care; the type of foster care placement agency; and the source of the foster care payments. 
For children under age 19 in foster care, section 131 permits providers to exclude payments when a State (or one of its political subdivisions) or a charitable tax-exempt placement agency places the individual in foster care and makes the foster care payments. For persons age 19 and older, section 131 permits providers to exclude foster care payments only when a State (or one of its political subdivisions) places the individual and makes the payments. 
This bill will simplify these anachronistic tax rules by expanding the tax code's exclusion to include foster care payments for all persons in foster care, regardless of age, even if the foster care placement is made by a foster care placement agency and even if foster care payments are received through a foster care placement agency, rather than directly from a State (or one of its political subdivisions). To ensure appropriate oversight, the bill requires that the placement agency be either licensed by, or under contract with, a State or a political subdivision thereof. 
Increasingly, State and local governments are relying on private agencies to arrange for foster care services for children and adults. While foster care for children has been in existence for decades, foster care for adults is a more recent phenomenon. Sometimes referred to as `host homes' or `developmental homes,' adult foster care facilities have proven to be an effective alternative to institutional care for adults with disabilities. My home State of Vermont, at the forefront of efforts to develop individualized alternatives to institutional care, authorizes local developmental service providers to act as placement agencies and to contract with families willing to provide foster care in their homes. The tax law's disparate tax treatment of foster care payments, however, impedes alternative arrangements. Persons providing foster care for individuals placed in their homes by the government can exclude foster care payments from income. For providers receiving payments from private agencies, however, the exclusion is not available (unless the individual in foster care is under age 19 and the placement agency is a nonprofit organization). These rules discourage families willing to provide foster care in their homes to persons placed by private placement agencies, thus reducing the availability of care alternatives. Because of the complexity of the current law, providers often receive conflicting advice from tax professionals regarding the proper tax treatment of foster care payments they receive. 
Mr. President, this bill will advance the development of family-based foster care services, a highly valued alternative to institutionalization. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an important bill. It is a bill that is designed to address what is probably the most serious problem we have in the United States in our educational system, and that is the inability of our school system to provide young people who graduate from high school with the skills necessary, in just the very basics of reading. To enable our nation to proceed into the next century as we should and to maximize the potential of these young people, we must assure that our high school graduates have these essential skills. 
Back in 1983, the Reagan administration, through Education Secretary Terrel Bell, delivered a report to the Nation called `A Nation At Risk.' That report outlined the serious problems we have in our educational system and observed that the output of our primary and secondary educational schools was not anywhere near what it needed to be in order to meet the challenges posed by our Asian and European competitors. Many problems were delineated in that report. One on which we have focused a great deal of attention is performance in mathematics. 
The United States, among all the industrialized nations, was at the bottom in tests given to our young people to determine their abilities in mathematics. We were dead last among our competitor nations. So, in a number of ways, we have tried to improve the results of our educational system with respect to mathematics. The studies have also shown that our industries have found that problems are not limited just to mathematics. Rather, they found that the basic problem was that their workers could not read the problems in order to determine the mathematics necessary to solve them. Mastering the very basics of reading was essential before they could understand how to answer the problems in mathematics. 
We have been trying to make improvements since 1983. In 1988, the Governors met with the President and established national goals--sometimes referred to as Goals 2000--to try to emphasize that changes must be made in our educational system in order to make this Nation what it ought to be as we go into the next century. 
As a result of that initiative, in 1994, we established a goals panel in order to determine whether or not we were making any improvement in these essential areas. I sit on that goals panel. I have been a member now for some 4 years, and I am sorry to report--and this has already been reported--that, in those 4 years, there has not been any indication that we have made any progress toward these goals, even in the area of reading. And the same is true with respect to mathematics. In fact, just recently, the last IMS study--International Mathematics Study --showed that our students graduating from high school were again at the bottom of all industrialized nations, as far as their capacity to solve mathematical problems. 
That same study indicated that our fourth graders were the best in the world, and our eighth graders were average. But, by the time they graduated from high school, they were well behind. Part of that problem stems from problems with reading and the ability to understand problems. 
I point out another situation with respect to reading that is very instructive in this regard. 
Motorola, back in the early 1980s, was in a real fight with Japan on cellular phones. The CEO of Motorola said he had to develop a new factory employing individuals with the skills necessary to produce cellular phones that would be equal to or better than those of the Japanese. So a study group was established. The study group indicated that they had a problem with respect to trying to get the skilled workforce necessary in order to compete with the Japanese. They also took a look at Malaysia and other areas. They reported back to the CEO that our workers were not capable of the productivity necessary. So they opted to locate the plant in Malaysia. The CEO, being a strong American, said `No. We are not going to locate a plant in Malaysia. I want to find out why we are unable to find and to train the workers necessary to get the best productivity.' 
A study was conducted, which found out that the reason for the problem was the inability to answer math problems. That was one thing. But, then, they found that the reason workers were not able to solve the math problems was that they couldn't read the math problems. The company created the necessary remedial training first to train the workers how to read and then to allow them to do the math problems. Believe it or not, they were able to do that with the remedial training. 
So the CEO said, `We are going to locate that plant in the United States.' They did. It proved to be the most productive plant in all of the Motorola operations, with higher productivity than the Japanese. It is a long story about Motorola. But, finally, they were able to outdo the Japanese and to outsell them. In fact, they were even able to break into the markets in Japan and to outsell the Japanese. It goes back to the basics. The workers couldn't read. 
Another study which is instructional was done in, I believe, 1993. It was a national literacy study that showed that 51 percent of the high school graduates who were examined were found to be functionally illiterate. That is incredible. You wonder why our business people say they don't even bother to look at a diploma of a kid out of high school because it doesn't mean anything. That is another area that we are trying to improve and, at a minimum, to make sure that everyone who gets a high school diploma knows how to read. 
We looked into this and found what had happened. The reason this dismal result was appearing was that, back in the 1960s, studies were done at Cornell University. At that time, we had this big awakening about the problems of neurosis and young people and things that stimulated mental problems. Researchers concluded that the worst thing one could do was to fail a kid in school because that would create a neurosis and the child would have problems the rest of his or her life. 
That led to the development of so-called `social promotion.' In other words, the attitude was, `Well, if they can't read, pack them on.' That might have been fine from the second to the third grade and maybe even from the third or fourth grades if somebody would have picked them up and taught them how to read. But nobody ever picked them up. The teachers were busy teaching the ones who knew how to read. They did not have time for those who didn't know how to read. Social promotion is a reality in probably all of our schools. 
You wonder why our CEO's say, `We don't even look at diplomas to determine whether the kids should come to us to work.' 
Getting to today, this problem with reading was emphasized, and we determined that we had to do something. Working with the Administration, we prepared the reading bill before us today. This legislation provides for ample funding and lays out everything that we believe we need to do in order to take not only corrective action before students get out of the third and fourth grades to make sure that they read, but also to make sure we have remedial training for all of those in the higher grades who didn t master reading in their early school years. 
In the budget account, we attached $250 million for this bill to assist in trying to find a remedial program which will be successful in getting our young people to read. 
A number of people have worked very hard on this bill. Senator Kennedy, I expect, will be here before too long. Senator Coverdell and Senator Coats and Senators Gregg and Hutchinson all really worked hard to bring about this bill and to make sure that it received favorable consideration. 
On the House side Representatives Clay, Hilleary and Riggs, and especially my good friend Bill Goodling. Chairman Goodling has championed literacy throughout his tenure, and he has done a wonderful job in making sure that the reading bill got to us. I am now working very closely with him as we go towards the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
In my view, the bill provides the necessary remedial help to get our schools on a path where we can assist substantially in getting young people to read and to graduate from high school in a manner which will be productive for them and for our society. 
I mentioned Senator Kennedy. He is here. The work that he has done in championing this cause is very notable.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that last night we passed S. 2432, the Assistive Technology Act of 1998, the ATA. In the spring of 1988, I made a commitment to individuals with disabilities. I said that I would, with their help, and that of my colleagues, develop and pass legislation that would provide greater access to assistive technology for people with disabilities. Between April and August of that year, we did just that. The Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities, commonly referred to as the Tech Act, became P. L. 100-407 and received its first appropriation. That legislation has had a successful 10 year run. It sunsets on September 30, 1998. 
This spring I made another commitment. I said I would, with the help of my friends in the disability community, my partners Senators Harkin and Bond, develop new technology legislation that would promote greater access to technology for people with disabilities, promote greater interest in and investment by the Federal Government and public and private entities in addressing the unmet technology needs of individuals with disabilities, and create expanded means by which individuals with disabilities could purchase assistive technology. We were joined in our efforts by Senators Kerry, McConnell, Collins, Kennedy, Reed, Frist, DeWine, Bingaman, Wellstone, Warner, Dodd, Faircloth, Ford, Mikulski, Sarbanes, D'Amato, Reid, Cochran, and Johnson. This legislation will equip individuals with disabilities through technology, to sustain their functioning, to expand their range of abilities, to be more independent, and to contribute at home, in school, at work, and in the community.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire that one of the main obstacles to the adoption of the loan flexibility proposal was the cost implications raised by CBO. In fact, budget considerations prevented us from making a number of beneficial changes in the Act which I know members would have liked to have provided. I am favorably disposed to the loan flexibility proposal on a substantive policy basis, and I am willing to continue to work with the Senator from New Hampshire and other interested parties to gain its enactment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think all you need to do is take a look at the conference report as it sits on the desk to understand the amount of work that has gone into this bill. This is an extremely important bill, and I am extremely pleased that the Senate is on the verge of sending to the President the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
Today marks the culmination of 18 months of hard work that, for me, began with the Labor Committee's hearing in Burlington, Vermont last February. 
The Higher Education Act is among the most significant statutes under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Since its inception in 1965, the Act has been focused on enhancing the opportunities of students to pursue postsecondary education. The grant, loan, and work study assistance made available by this Act has made the difference for countless millions in pursuing their dreams for a better life. The legislation we are considering today builds on the proud legacy of this Act. 
In the face of rising college costs, Congress will provide students with the lowest cost loans in nearly two decades. With increasing concern about the quality of our nation's teachers, this bill will take giant steps in improving teacher preparation. And with students, parents, and--frankly--Senators concerned about the delivery of student aid, this bill completely overhauls the federal role by placing it in the hands of a professional and accountable agency within the Department of Education. 
Getting to this point has been a challenging, but rewarding, journey. The process in both the House and Senate has been characterized by a spirit of bipartisanship, with members sharing the basic objective of making higher education programs work better for students and their families. I commend the work of the chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Representative Bill Goodling, and the committee's ranking member Representative Bill Clay. The House subcommittee leadership, Representative Buck McKeon, and ranking member Representative Dale Kildee have also done a yeoman's job throughout the process. 
I would also like to acknowledge in particular the contributions of the labor committee's ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, and the efforts of Senator Coats and of Senator Dodd. From the beginning, these three members have been steadfast in their commitment to work through differences and to craft a solid piece of legislation. 
At the start of the reauthorization process, we set out to achieve a number of important goals designed to strengthen higher education programs. I am pleased to say that this conference report achieves the major objectives identified at the beginning of our efforts: to assist students, to improve the quality of teaching, to maintain two viable loan programs, and to improve the delivery of student financial aid. 
First, the final bill preserves the focus on students--who are the primary reason we have a Higher Education Act in the first place. Students now in school will be assured of receiving the lowest interest rate in nearly two decades on their loans. 
Students now in high school who aspire to a college education will benefit from an expanded early intervention program known as GEAR UP, as well as continuing to receive services from the time-tested and highly regarded TRIO programs. The new GEAR UP program combines features of the existing National Early Intervention Scholarship Program, which I sponsored in 1992, with recommendations proposed by the Administration and included in the House bill. The GEAR UP program preserves the best features of the program now operating successfully in 9 states, while expanding the pool of participants and approaches involved in early intervention. 
Students who have graduated and are faced with exceptionally high loan burdens will be able to take advantage of extended repayment options under the guaranteed loan program. In addition, the measure provides a four-month window within which students may obtain Direct consolidation loans at an interest rate set at the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus 2.3 percent. 
Recognizing the toll which ever increasing colleges costs are placing on students, the bill builds on recommendations of the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education so that students and their families can obtain useful cost information. 
Second, perhaps the most exciting and far-reaching innovation in this legislation is its provisions dealing with teacher preparation. Numerous small, categorical--and unfunded--teacher training programs are repealed and replaced with a comprehensive model for change and improvement. The teacher quality provisions included in Title II of H.R. 6 are an important first step towards really improving teacher training. Working at both the state level to promote system-wide reforms and at the local level to develop partnerships to enhance the quality of teacher training, the bill offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to this pressing national need. 
At its foundation, these provisions embrace the notion that investing in the preparation of our nation's teachers is a good one. Well prepared teachers play a key role in making it possible for our students to achieve the standards required to assure both their own well being and the ability of our country to compete internationally. In fact, the continued health and strength of our nation depends on our country's ability to improve the education of our young people. Integral to that is the strength and ability of our nation's teaching force. Without a strong, competent, well prepared teaching force, other investments in education will be of little value. I think these provisions will be viewed as one of the lasting achievements of this reauthorization. 
In addition, the legislation provides loan forgiveness for students who go into teaching. It is my hope that this new benefit will expand the number of talented teachers serving school districts with large numbers of low-income children. 
Third, this bill reflects a strong commitment to the maintenance of two viable loan programs--the guaranteed or Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and the Direct Loan Program. To the extent possible within budgetary constraints, the bill `levels the playing field' to assure the continuation of fair and healthy competition between the two programs. This bill extends the provisions of the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997 which permit Direct loans to be included in FFELP consolidation packages. Following a four-month period (October 1, 1998, to January 31, 1999) in which Direct consolidation loans will be set at the 91-day Treasury bill rate plus 2.3 percent, Direct and FFELP consolidation loans will carry the same interest rate. That rate will be the weighted average of the loans consolidated, rounded up to the nearly one-eighth of a percent and capped at 8.25 percent. 
Among the most challenging tasks facing the committee was developing a student loan interest rate which could offer the lowest viable interest to students while assuring sufficient lender participation to preserve full access to loans. After extensive consultation with students, lenders, representatives of the higher education community, the administration and financial services experts, a compromise interest rate package was developed. Lender yield is reduced by 30 basis points, while students receive the significant interest rate reduction they have anticipated. This solution is by no means perfect, but it promises to preserve the stability of the FFEL program for the nearly 4 million students and their families who depend upon these loans each year. 
Fourth, the legislation includes a number of initiatives designed to improve the delivery of student financial aid services. It includes a new guaranty agency financing model--the goal of which is to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in the delivery and administration of student aid while ensuring that students, lenders, the Federal government, and institutions of higher education receive high quality service. Additional efforts to improve the delivery of student aid programs include the development of a Performance Based Organization (PBO) to strengthen the management of key systems within the Department of Education. A number of provisions in the legislation also pave the way toward taking advantage of the efficiencies made possible through electronic processing and other technological advances. 
Looking toward the future, the bill contains several provisions dealing with the Year 2000 computer problem. The Office of Management and Budget has raised serious questions about the Department of Education's ability to meet the timetable outlined by the General Accounting Office for the testing of software renovation work. Failure to renovate all mission critical systems could result in disruptions in the management and delivery of student financial aid to more than 8 million students. This is an area which the committee will be following closely in the months ahead. 
Finally, I would point out that this legislation complies with the Budget Act. In order to bring the bill into balance, the conferees had to make a number of difficult decisions. In making these decisions, we attempted to select options which would maintain the lowest possible interest rates for students and which would preserve new student benefits such as extended repayment options under the guaranteed loan program and teacher loan forgiveness. I recognize that particular concern has been raised about provisions in the bill which eliminate a provision of the bankruptcy law that permits individuals filing for bankruptcy to have their student loans canceled if the loans have been in repayment for seven years or longer. Individuals who file for bankruptcy may still have their student loans canceled if the bankruptcy court determines that repaying the loans would cause undue hardship. Currently, the undue hardship option accounts for 70 percent of all student loan discharges. In addition, a number of options are available to assist borrowers who are having difficulties repaying their loans, including deferment, forbearance, cancellation and extended, graduated, income-contingent and income-sensitive repayment options. In just about every case, these options are preferable to declaring bankruptcy. 
Over the years, the federal effort in higher education has been substantial, and this legislation will assure that it will continue to be so. The Higher Education Act currently provides $48.5 billion in student financial assistance for 8.5 million students and $216 million for institutional development. In 1995-96, 55 percent of undergraduate students received financial aid under this Act. Over the next ten years, the Federal government will guarantee over 88 million student loans--totaling over $383.5 billion. Over the next five years, the Federal government will provide more than 25.4 million Pell Grants. 
As I said before, Mr. President, this conference report to the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 is the culmination of almost two years of good bipartisan work. Not only does it represent a huge victory for America's students, but it represents a victory for all Americans as it shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together when it comes to the needs of our next generation. This legislation gives millions of students the financial key to unlock the door to higher education. By lowering the interest rate for student loans to the lowest levels in nearly 20 years and by increasing the level of Pell grants, we are allowing higher-learning to mean higher-earnings for more of our children. Vermont has a proud tradition when it comes to higher education in the United States Senate, from Bob Stafford to Justin Smith Morrill. I can only hope that, with the passage of this legislation, I will have helped continue that tradition. 
By increasing the access and quality of higher education, this bill will help ensure that our nation remains a leader in educational excellence for all of our citizens. It deserves the support of all members of the Senate.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Senator Coats is on his way. Let me, in the interim, mention that education, as we know now, is a top interest in poll after poll of Americans. They want to see their educational system reformed in a way that can lead them into a position where this Nation has the best educational system in the world. Unfortunately, that is not the case right now. But we are taking a huge step forward with the higher education bill, not just in that matter which affects the students in higher education, but also the second title of the bill which deals with reforming teacher preparation. 
Nothing is going to change in the classroom until the teacher changes, and the teacher isn't going to change until the teacher knows what he or she has to do in order to make our system better. 
As we move into the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization next year, we want to make sure that the universities are aware that they have a role to play in ensuring that every new teacher who comes into the system is ready for the changes which are necessary to make our educational system the best in the world. 
I look forward, as we move forward into next year, to continuing the effort that our committee has taken to make this Nation's educational system the best in the world. I am confident we can do that. 
But right now we do know we have much left to do. But hopefully working first with those who are teaching the teachers, we can make sure that we stop the flow in of young people who want to teach but do not have an adequate education at the universities and colleges that they should have in this day and age.

Mr. JEFFORDS. It is my understanding that the Budget Committee has asked CBO to conduct a broader-based study on student loan interest rates, subsidies, and the larger student aid program. I expect that study to be a valuable as well, and it is my view that the knowledge gained through this work could be of great benefit to the Department of Education and the Comptroller General as they undertake their own study. The role of CBO in the study contained in the conference agreement is to assist the other participants ask the right kinds of questions, use valid research and analytical tools, analyze the validity of the study's design or conclusions, where objective analysis can be brought to bear, and be an overall, non-partisan, resource for participants in the study.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in closing, I am extremely pleased that the Senate with this vote, will have completed action on the conference report accompanying H.R. 6, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. 
The scope of the Higher Education Act is so broad that the reauthorization of all the programs it covers is necessarily a demanding and time-consuming task. Bringing this process to a conclusion would not have been possible without the concerted efforts of members of both parties in both the House and the Senate. 
I express my particular gratitude to the members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and their staffs, who have pulled together over the past 18 months to help shape a bill which will help ensure that our nation remains a leader in educational excellence for all of our citizens. 
Each and every member of the committee made a positive contribution to the development and refinement of this measure. I very much value the time, effort, and commitment they have brought to this task. 
I also extend my sincerest thanks to the many staff people who contributed to this product. 
I particularly recognize the efforts of Marianna Pierce and Jane Oates with Senator Kennedy, Townsend Lange with Senator Coats, and Suzanne Day and Megan Murray with Senator Dodd. These individuals--along with my own staff members, Scott Giles, Susan Hattan, Cory Heyman, Pamela Moran, and Jenny Smulson--went `above and beyond' in terms of their diligent work on each and every aspect of this measure. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Heidi Scheuerman, Carolyn Dupree, and Leah Booth of my staff--who brought a semblance of control to the vast quantities of paper produced throughout this process. 
I also recognize and thank the staff of other members of the committee--all of whom have shown great dedication to this cause: 
Jackie Cooney with Senator Gregg; 
Lori Meyer with Senator Frist; 
John Connelly with Senator DeWine; 
Chad Calvert with Senator Enzi; 
Jenny Saunders and Rhett Butler with Senator Hutchinson; 
Julian Haynes with Senator Collins; 
Angie Stewart and Chas Phillips with Senator Warner; 
Robin Bowen and Holly Hacker with Senator McConnell; 
Bev Schroeder with Senator Harkin; 
Deborah Connelly with Senator Mikulski; 
Alexander Russo and Rena Subotnik with Senator Bingaman; 
Roger Wolfson and Robin Burkhe with Senator Wellstone; 
Mike Egan with Senator Murray; and 
Elyse Wasch with Senator Reed. 
I want to acknowledge the extraordinary assistance offered by Debb Kalcevic, Robin Seiler, Josh O'Hara, and Justin Latus with the Congressional Budget Office, Mark Sigurski with Senate Legislative Counsel, and Margot Schenet, Jim Stedman, and Barbara Miles, with the Congressional Research Service. 
This process has been a collaborative and bipartisan one every step of the way. It has produced a measure of which we can all be proud. 
Mr. President, I have no other requests for time. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened to my good friend from Minnesota, and certainly understand his concerns. But I think the picture he gives of the situation is somewhat different than what I perceive. I have faithfully supported minimum wage increases over the years, but there comes a time when we try to push things too fast and we could well destroy the very goals we are trying to reach. 
One of my major goals as chairman of the Labor Committee is to get people into the workforce and keep them there. That is why I worked so hard with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact legislation that will improve and streamline our adult education job-training programs. That is why I am working so hard on developing legislation that will improve our postsecondary, adult and vocational education. That is why I have, with my friend from Massachusetts, introduced legislation to help the disabled find jobs and get off the federal rolls while maintaining their health benefits. And that is why, although I have supported past minimum wage increases, I am concerned that if we raise the minimum wage too soon after the last increase, we may cause more harm than good. 
Here in Congress, we continually grapple with the issue of how to assist low-skilled workers--particularly workers who have to support a family--without destroying the very jobs they rely on to support themselves and their families. It is hard for people with families and low skills to get by. We have seen and heard a lot of evidence about this. But it is also hard for small businesses to get by. Business failures are commonplace and margins are thin. When we raise the minimum wage, we make it more difficult for these businesses to justify hiring inexperienced, unskilled, and untrained workers. 
For the past 60 years, we have relied upon the minimum wage to set a floor beneath wages. Every time we have increased it, we have given businesses five years or so to adjust from the last increase to the next enactment. The only exception was once during the 1970s when the real minimum wage declined even as the nominal wage was increasing. Those of us will remember, this was during a time of incredible inflation. 
However, before the last increase even took effect, the senior Senator from Massachusetts had launched a new campaign for another increase in the minimum wage. The net effect of these increases would be a 45 percent rise in the minimum wage over a four and a half-year period. I am concerned that saddling small business with this steep increase over a relatively short period of time will have some negative repercussions both on the business owners as well as workers who count on their minimum wage jobs, and perhaps on those individuals who are seeking their very first job. 
Although increases in the minimum wage have been important, they are not the only tool we have used to assist low-income workers who are supporting families. In addition, we have developed targeted government supports for the working poor, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). 
Over the years, the EITC has been expanded to target and supplement the wages of low income families without threatening any job loss. This year, the EITC will enable a minimum wage worker who is either a single parent or the single wage earning parent of dependent children to receive 3,756 additional dollars, bringing that family's income to $14,468. In addition, the EITC is set up so that these families do not have to wait for a lump-sum tax refund; instead the workers can receive the tax credit in their weekly paychecks. 
A recent report released by the Center on Budget and Policies Priorities found that the EITC now moves more than two million children out of poverty. The report concluded that, `the EITC is the most effective safety net program for children in working poor families.' I strongly support the EITC because it is making a difference in the lives of working families. I also support the EITC because it provides an incentive to work, the incentive is specifically targeted to help workers from low income families, and it does so without threatening jobs, as a minimum wage increase will. 
Further, I am concerned that when we raise the minimum wage we are not targeting low income workers. Statistics show that more than half of the minimum wage workers live in families with yearly incomes over $25,000. In addition, statistics reveal that the majority of minimum wage earners are young, single and childless. I understand that in my home state of Vermont, only a small percentage of minimum wage workers are supporting their families on their wages. The fact that an increase in the minimum wage does not specifically target low income families becomes particularly significant when we consider the dramatic impact that a back-to-back increase will have on small businesses as compared to the actual number of low-income working families who will be helped by the increase. 
I believe that we should give the last minimum wage increase some time to be absorbed into the economy before we move to increase it again. I also think that we should continue to focus our efforts on assisting the working poor by working to improve and expand targeted approaches such as the EITC. 
Finally, I believe that before we open up the Fair Labor Standards Act to raise the minimum wage, we should take some additional steps to update the FLSA to better assist our working families. 
This update is sorely needed because, while the makeup of the American workforce has changed dramatically over the past 60 years, few provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act have been updated to reflect those changes. The needs of today's workforce are different than the needs of the workforce of the 1930s. Increasingly, employees are requesting that their employers offer more flexible work schedules and compensation packages. Unfortunately, the FLSA and its underlying regulations preclude employers from accommodating such requests. In other words, even though our workers are requesting more flexible working arrangements so that they can juggle work and family obligations--the arrangements that would be most helpful to these workers are actually prohibited under current law. And our attempts to change that were frustrated earlier in this past session. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act would assist these working families by amending the FLSA to allow employees the ability to choose comp. time-- the opportunity to choose paid time off instead of cash compensation for overtime work. It would also allow employees to work a flexible biweekly schedule--to schedule their hours over a two-week period so that they can work additional hours during one week in order to take that time off during the second week. These same options have been available to Federal, State, and local employees for some time and they have been extremely popular with these public sector employees. 
Why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to acknowledge this and allow us to bring the FSLA up to the present-day needs of this Nation I do not know. 
During the first session of the 105th Congress, we engaged in contentious and partisan debate over the Family Friendly Workplace Act. While we were able to pass the bill out of the Labor Committee, our Democratic colleagues prevented us from moving forward on the floor of the Senate. 
To be quite truthful, I still have a hard time fathoming why this issue has been so contentious. After all, we are talking about amending the law so that hourly employees in the private sector will be able to partake in some of the same scheduling options that salaried and public-sector employees currently enjoy. The public support for this bill has been overwhelming, and I am frustrated that we have been unable to move it forward. 
The point I am trying to make here today, Mr. President, is that while the minimum wage is important--and obviously it is--another increase at this time will not necessarily benefit our workforce. However, there are things that we can do today that will benefit working families. It is my hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will recognize this point and will begin working with me to help our workers meet the needs of their families by amending the FLSA to allow for more flexible work schedules. I hope my colleagues will lift their prohibition and allow us to consider this very important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my full support for and co-sponsorship of legislation introduced yesterday by the Commerce Committee Chairman, Senator McCain, that will fix a vexing problem that is causing citizens in my state of Vermont and throughout the country to lose their access to television network programming. 
Mr. President, Vermonters are contacting me saying they are very frustrated to be caught in the middle of a legal battle between broadcast and satellite television providers. In many parts of Vermont, and especially in the winter, television is our access to the world. As a satellite dish owner myself, I know that in many parts of Vermont, it is impossible to view television progamming without cable or satellite television service. Vermont's many mountains and valleys can enable one homeowner at the top of a hollow to receive a broadcast signal just fine, but his neighbor down in the hollow needs a satellite dish to receive anything at all. 
I am hopeful that this legislation will fix these problems quickly and fairly. I believe Senator McCain's bill will both protect the rights of local broadcasters while ensuring that Vermonters do not have their satellite service unfairly cutoff. I urge its quick passage. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we will vote once again on legislation offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania to ban the dilation and extraction, or D&X, procedure used by doctors, H.R. 1122. I will be voting against this ban for the fourth time in as many years. 
My reasons for opposing this legislation are well-known. First, I believe that this bill undermines the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade to leave these critical matters to the states. Those states who have chosen not to pass legislation banning late-term procedures leave the decision to the woman, her family and their doctor. 
Second, I believe that a woman's right to control her own reproductive destiny is protected as part of the Constitutional right to privacy. The Supreme Court under Roe has decided that the decision of whether to undergo an abortion is a matter of individual conscience and should be made by a woman in thoughtful consultation with her doctor. 
Third, preventing doctors from using the D&X procedure only when it is necessary to save the life of the mother clearly goes against the Supreme Court's decision in Roe. Roe requires the states to safeguard the life and health of the mother when they regulate late-term abortions. Because of the unconstitutionality of this legislation, I feel I cannot support its passage. 
Finally, I believe that women who choose to undergo a D&X procedure do so for grave reasons and I trust that those states that have chosen to regulate late-term abortions do so in a manner that both protects the mother and prevents unnecessary abortions. The Supreme Court has established a delicate legal framework in which to address late-term abortions and we should not shift the decision making to the federal government. 
Mr. SANTORUM, Mr. President, I believe I am the last speaker. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent the time run off the opposition's side.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior, Senator Gorton for his work, and the work of his staff in providing an increase in appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts. I believe that the Committee recommendation reflects a sound understanding about what this public agency does. In recommending an increase in funding for NEA, the Committee has acknowledged the positive impact that the NEA has made to our nation, especially in the areas of education and exchange of cultural programs across the country. 
As I just mentioned, one area that deserves particular attention is education. Broad based activities involving the arts make a significant and positive difference in the lives of millions of children each year. 
It is in the national interest to provide support for programs which make the arts part of the education of our young people and NEA has funded extraordinary programs that do just that. By exciting students about learning--by making music, visual arts and song part of their lives--in school, afterschool or on weekends, we are strengthening their education. By strengthening their education, we are strengthening our nation. 
A recent study has shown that students of the arts are more successful on the SAT. In 1995, College Board figures showed that students who had studied the arts four or more years scored 59 points higher in the verbal and 44 points higher in the math portions of the SAT compared with students who had no course work or experience in the arts. Increasing our nation's young people's exposure to the arts has measurable good results. 
The NEA has also made a significant difference in extending the availability of the arts in communities throughout the country. There are programs supported by the NEA which are of immeasurable benefit to folks all across this nation--in every one of our States. Recently, the NEA has implemented the ArtsREACH program which is designed to increase the direct NEA grant assistance to underserved areas. ArtsREACH holds great promise in providing more American communities with the financial assistance that is necessary to strengthen their own locally-based arts endeavors. 
While federal funding for the arts is but a small part of overall funding for the arts, the federal funds distributed by the NEA make a BIG difference in spreading the cultural and artistic wealth of our nation to small towns and communities everywhere. This commitment to promoting outreach, accessibility and participation in the arts, in my view, is the most important mission of the NEA. And it is something that the NEA has done quite well since its creation in 1965. 
The NEA's commitment to excellence in and access to the arts is evident in the types of grants it made to Vermont. Vermonters--and others visiting the state--will now have an opportunity to learn more about the pottery produced in Bennington from the late 18th century thanks to a grant made to the Bennington Museum; they will have an opportunity to hear the Vermont Symphony Orchestra perform in rural communities as part of the statewide `Made for Vermont' tour; they will hear radio broadcasts on traditional storytelling as part of the `New England Touchstones' series produced by the Vermont Folklife Center. 
Another NEA grant will allow Vermont to export and share some of its talent with other states. NEA has provided support to the Manchester Music Festival so that the Music Festival Orchestra can play in schools in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts. 
It is examples like the ones I mentioned from Vermont, which underscore the value of the federal government's role in fostering our cultural heritage. 
There is great value in ensuring that all individuals have an opportunity to experience the beauty of dance, the magic of theater, the enchantment of reading, and the wondrous way that visiting a museum can take you to another place. Our federal investment in the arts yields returns of immeasurable value. 
For those who have been skeptical of providing funds to the NEA in the past, I would hope that they would take note of the significant changes that have been made by Congress and the Agency itself to improve operations and make the NEA more responsive to the needs of the American people. Bill Ivey has recently taken over as Chairman of the NEA and I believe we should give him an opportunity to succeed. As I mentioned, the ArtsREACH program will go a long way in `spreading the wealth' of the NEA more widely. This program represents a step in the right direction taken by the agency. There are now members of Congress sitting on the National Council on the Arts who are able to participate `first-hand' in the grant making decisions of the Agency. Caps on funds available to any one State are in effect assuring a more fair distribution of funds to all States. These improvements thoughtfully and directly address criticisms that have been made in the past. 
Art is important to the people of this nation and the NEA helps make the arts a part of more peoples lives. Just two weeks ago, over 2,600 people waited in line for over six hours outside the National Gallery of Art to secure a ticket to the upcoming exhibition of works of art painted by Vincent Van Gogh. The temperature was 97 degrees! yet people braved the heat for hours just to have the opportunity to admire the works of this great master painter. This exhibition would not be possible without the support that the NEA provides though indemnity and clearly, this type of sponsorship is just the kind of thing the people of our nation want us to invest in--the numbers make that clear! 
Society, since the beginning of time, has left behind a chronicle of the past through its art. We will be remembered and understood by the architecture, monuments, arts and writing we pass on to the next generation. What we do today will have an enormous impact in the future and how we as a nation are perceived in the future. We must not be shortsighted and we should recognize that nurturing and preserving the heart and the soul of our country today will preserve the greatness of the nation for all time. 
It is my hope that the Senate will stand firm in and support the recommendation made by the Interior Appropriations Committee and support this modest increase in funding for the NEA. 
The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute for Museum and Library Services are agencies with small budgets that provide extraordinary service to the people of this nation. I encourage my colleagues to support each of these agencies. 
Again, I would like to thank Senator Gorton for his leadership on this issue.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the amendment being offered by Senators John McCain and Russ Feingold to motivate the Senate and conclude action on campaign finance reform legislation. 
Before I proceed, I would like to point something out about the decision the Senator from Alabama referenced to defend nondisclosure. The Supreme Court in that case said if the people were threatened with bodily injury or death, they did not have to disclose their names. That is hardly, I hope, the case that we have here. I hope people would not rely upon that Alabama decision to say that the present procedure that we have here, allowing people to hide themselves behind their ads, is legitimized by that decision. 
I also thank the Senator from Maine, who worked very strenuously on this amendment with respect to disclosure. To me, it is incredible to think anybody can object to what we are suggesting, which is that if people put something on the air obviously aimed at candidates, we ought to know who they are. I just cannot understand how anybody can take the position that is a violation of the freedom of speech. 
Also, let me congratulate the House of Representatives for passing campaign finance reform legislation shortly before the August break. This was a first step toward achieving our mutual goal of having a campaign finance system that is fair and equitable. Such a system should ensure that the electorate is fully informed and that the pool of potential candidates is not limited by financial barriers. 
Earlier this year we fell eight votes short of passing the McCain/Feingold campaign finance reform legislation. During consideration of this bill an important amendment offered by Senator Snowe and I was adopted, and I am pleased that Senators McCain and Feingold have included this language in the amendment we are considering today. I think it is a critical amendment. The willingness of my colleagues to include this language and the leadership of the Vermont legislature on this issue last year has convinced me that it is time to move forward and pass this amendment. 
The McCain-Feingold amendment with the Jeffords-Snowe language boosts disclosure requirements and tightens expenditures of certain funds in the weeks preceding a primary and general election. The last few election cycles have shown that spending has grown astronomically in two areas that cause me great concern. First, issue ads that have turned into blatant electioneering. Second, the unfettered spending by corporations and unions to influence the outcome of an election. This amendment with the Jeffords-Snowe language addresses these areas in a reasonable, equitable and last but not least, constitutional way. 
Mr. President, reform of the campaign finance system is long overdue. The litany of problems and short comings of our current system is long and well known, but the full Congress has so far been reluctant to act. 
Since my election to the House in the wake of the Watergate scandal, I have worked with my colleagues to craft campaign finance reform legislation that could endure the legislative process and survive a constitutional challenge. We came close in 1994, and I believe circumstances still remain right for enactment of meaningful campaign finance reform during this Congress. This belief has only been strengthened by the recent actions taken by the House. 
The Senate is known for its ability to have full and complete debates on any issue, and campaign finance should be no different, but debate on this important topic should eventually reach an end. We may not agree on the solution, but we must move forward, debate the issue and ultimately reach a conclusion. Let the process run its course, let Senators offer their amendments and get their votes. But, in the end let the Senate complete consideration of this issue. 
Mr. President, if Mark McGwire can hit 62 home-runs, Congress can surely pass this important legislation and hit one home-run for cleaner campaign financing. I remain hopeful that my colleagues will join me in allowing the Senate to conclude debate on this issue.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and against the motion to table. This amendment was worked on by many of us who sincerely believe that the future of this Nation must rely, to a certain extent, on our good understanding of the past and of history and of the battles that this Nation fought in its infancy--basically, the Civil War battlefields. 
As we approach the next millennium, many of these battlefields are very critical in understanding the history of the Civil War. And in understanding the sacrifices made by so many Americans, Senator Torricelli, myself and others, with the great cooperation of the Senator from Washington, worked out a plan where we could raise a sufficient amount of money to really work with States and local governments to be able to take care of and preserve those battlefields that are so important in understanding the history of the Civil War. 
So I have opposed the motion to table and support very strongly the underlying amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to an issue that has not been given sufficient attention during debate on this bill--funding for the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The legislation before us provides $47.5 million for the GEF, far less than the Administration's request and $145 million short of the amount necessary to cover our arrears to the GEF. 
The GEF was created because the world's developed nations sought to involve the developing world in improving the global environment, but realized that they lacked the resources and technology to make significant progress on their own. The GEF was designed to help these nations act in an environmentally responsible manner in areas where their actions would have a broad environmental impact. For we all know that if we are going to make significant progress in solving the world's most pressing environmental problems, there will have to be a collective effort by most of the world's nations. 
In 1994, developed nations pledged $2 billion to the GEF, payable over four years. The U.S. portion of that replenishment was $430 million. To date, Congress has appropriated substantially less, and total arrears amount to $192.5 million. And now several donor countries are beginning to condition their own contributions on payment of our past due amounts. Without new funding, the GEF's ability to implement its programs will end in about six months. 
Mr. President, the GEF has emerged as the principal international funding mechanism for global environmental protection. The organization works in four areas--biodiversity, energy, ozone protection, and international waters. Over 500 projects in 119 countries have been funded under GEF's own unique approach. To obtain the most impact for its limited resources, the GEF generally does not fund entire projects. Instead it funds the difference between what it would cost a country to do a project in the traditional manner without environmental safeguards, and the cost of doing that same project in an environmentally responsible manner. 
Mr. President, we are all becoming increasingly aware that our biggest environmental problems will require global solutions. And these problems will require financial commitments from many nations. The GEF is the only institution of its kind, and is pivotal to the success of these efforts. While it is making strides in resolving some of these very serious problems, it is being hobbled by America's failure to pay up. Donors are looking to the U.S. to resume its leadership, and because of the special provisions of the balanced budget act allowing payment of U.S. arrearages to international institutions, we now have an opportunity to do so. I urge the managers of this legislation to make this issue a priority in conference with the other body and to seize the moment to make good on our debts.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, ten years ago Congress passed the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act, referred to as the `Tech Act'. My friend, Senator Harkin, was the principal sponsor in the Senate. I was the principal sponsor in the House. Both Houses of Congress worked together and passed the same legislation on the same day. Once again, Senator Harkin  and I, with our colleague Senator Bond, joined forces to draft the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 (ATA), which we are introducing today with the co-sponsorship of Senators Kennedy, Frist, Collins, McConnell, Reed, and Kerry. Once again, we are working toward expeditious consideration of legislation that promotes access to assistive technology for individuals with disabilities. With the assistance of our colleagues in the Senate and the other body, I am confident that the ATA will become law. The ATA authorizes funding for assistive technology activities for fiscal years 1999 through 2004. 
The ATA builds on the success of its predecessor, the Tech Act. The Tech Act sunsets September 30, 1998. This will result in the termination of federal assistance to nine states for promoting access to assistive technology for individuals with disabilities, and place the remainder of the states in jeopardy of diminished or no funding during or after fiscal year 1999. 
Through the ATA the Senate has the opportunity to reaffirm the federal role of promoting access to assistive technology devices and services for individuals with disabilities. The bill allows States flexibility in responding to the assistive technology needs of their citizens with disabilities, and does not disrupt the ongoing work of the 50 State assistive technology programs funded under the Tech Act. 
These programs make a difference. Access to assistive technology for an individual with a disability means independence, ability to work or attend school, and the opportunity to participate in community life. Lack of access to assistive technology means dependence and isolation. 
In my State of Vermont, Lynne Cleveland is the project director for our Tech Project. Lynne testified before the Labor and Human Resources Committee on April 29, 1998 on the impact of the Vermont Tech Project on the lives of Vermonters with disabilities. For example, one of the many things the Vermont Tech Project supports is a rehabilitation engineering technician program, the only one in the nation, at Vermont Technical College. Graduates of the program work for schools, non-profit agencies, state agencies, and vendors helping others make appropriate, cost-effective decisions regarding assistive technology for individuals with disabilities and educating others about the need for and value of the individual with a disability having a central role in such decisions. 
The Vermont Tech Project touches and changes the lives of individual Vermonters of all ages and walks of life. For Bill, a man in his mid-thirties who suffered a stroke, the Tech Project 
helped secure assistive technology that enabled him to obtain employment designing web pages. Equally important to Bill is that assistive technology enables him to talk again with his children. For Ray, who lost his vision in mid-life, acquiring assistive technology has allowed him to continue as a snowplow dispatcher for the State of Vermont. For Ty, a teenager born with a visual impairment, access to assistive technology means she can pursue her goal of becoming a lawyer. For Annie, a first grader with Downs Syndrome, having assistive technology means that she can use the computer in a regular education classroom, learning and playing games with her classmates. For Lillian, a senior citizen, access to and training on a closed circuit television, enables her to stay in her home rather than living in a nursing home. The Vermont Tech Project has touched each of these individuals by working with others to change policies, improve coordination, pool resources, and educate people about the benefits of assistive technology. 
Across the U.S., state assistive technology programs have brought about a wide range of improvements in the last decade. State assistive technology programs have contributed to changes in state laws, improved coordination among state agencies and between the public and private sector, all of which have expanded access to assistive technology. These programs have increased public awareness of the value of assistive technology, have educated individuals with disabilities about how to select and purchase appropriate assistive technology, and expanded the number of individuals in schools, the workplace, and other settings of community life that can provide assistance in selecting, securing, and using assistive technology. 
The ATA allows this important work to continue. Title I of the bill supports states in sustaining and strengthening their capacity to address the assistive technology needs of individuals with disabilities; title II brings focus to the federal investment in technology that could benefit individuals with disabilities; and title III supports micro-loan programs to provide assistance to individuals who desire to purchase assistive technology devices or assistive technology services. The legislation also draws attention to and promotes consideration of the principles of universal design in the design of future technology and using the power of the INTERNET to bring best practices related to assistive technology to anyone's keyboard. 
In title I the ATA streamlines and clarifies the expectations, including expectations related to accountability, associated with continuing federal support for state assistive technology programs. It targets specific, proven activities, as priorities, referred to as `mandatory activities'. All state grantees must set measurable goals in connection to their use of ATA funds, and both the goals and the approach to measuring the goals must be based on input from a state's citizens with disabilities. 
If a state has received fewer than 10 years of federal funding under the Tech Act for its assistive technology program, title I of the ATA allows a state, which submits a supplement (a continuity grant) to its current Tech Act grant for federal funds, to use ATA funds for mandatory activities: a public awareness program, interagency coordination, technical assistance and training, and outreach. Such a state also may use ATA funds for optional grant activities: alternative state-financed systems for assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, 
technology demonstrations, distribution of information about how to finance assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, and operation of a technology-related information system, or participation in interstate activities or public-private partnerships pertaining to assistive technology. 
If a state has had 10 years of funding for its assistive technology program through the Tech Act, the state may submit an application for a noncompetitive challenge grant under the ATA. Grant funds must be spent on specific activities--interagency coordination, an assistive technology information system, a public awareness program, technical assistance and training, and outreach activities. 
In fiscal years 2000 through 2004, if funding for title I exceeds a certain level, states operating under challenge grants may apply for additional ATA funding, provided through competitive millennium grants. These grants are to focus on specific state or local level capacity building activities related to access to technology for individuals with disabilities. 
Title I of the ATA also authorizes funding for protection and advocacy systems in each state to assist individuals with disabilities to access assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, and funding for a technical assistance program, including the National Public Internet Site, and specifies administrative procedures with regard to monitoring of entities funded under title I of the ATA. 
Title II of the ATA authorizes national activities, including increased coordination and communication among federal agencies with regard to addressing the assistive technology needs of individuals with disabilities. Title III of the Act authorizes a broad range of alternative financing mechanisms to assist individuals with the purchasing of assistive technology through micro-loans. 
Providing access to assistive technology for individuals with disabilities was a simple promise in 1988. Today it is much, much more. The ATA represents the bridge to the next century for individuals with disabilities. Across that bridge lies increased independence, realized potential, new partnerships, unimagined challenges, and unlimited opportunities.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to report language accompanying this legislation supporting U.S. ratification of an important treaty--the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, also known as the `Drylands' Convention. 
The term desertification is often mis-associated with the expansion of deserts. Rather, it is the loss of soil fertility in dryland agricultural areas. Most of the world's basic food crops are grown in dryland areas. Poverty, population pressure and unwise government policies often drive farmers to use unsustainable farming practices on marginal lands just to survive. Over time, desertification deepens poverty. It undercuts economic growth and triggers social instability in poor countries lacking resources to combat it. 
The American Dust Bowl of the 1930's is a prime example of desertification. The hunger, poverty and migration spawned by the Dust Bowl left an indelible mark on our national psyche. In 1939, John Steinbeck depicted the tragedy so well in his great American novel, The Grapes of Wrath: 
And then the dispossessed were drawn west--from Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico; from Nevada and Arkansas, families, tribes, dusted out, tractored out. Car-loads, caravans, homeless and hungry; twenty thousand and fifty thousand and a hundred thousand and two hundred thousand. They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless--restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do--to lift to push, to pull, to pick, to cut--anything, any burden to bear, for food. The kids are hungry. We got no place to live. Like ants scurrying for work, for food, and most of all for land. 
Every student of U.S. history studies the economic and social impact of the Dust Bowl. U.S. history textbooks feature photos similar to these behind me. 
Our national response to this disaster was a successful community-based soil and water conservation effort that is still fighting the threat of desertification in areas of the American West today. While we have grappled with this problem and won, the rest of the world is not so fortunate. Imagine our own Dust Bowl if we did not have the technological know-how or the economic resources to deal with it? 
The risk of new dust bowls is increasing at an accelerating rate in over ninety developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Billions of tons of topsoil are washed or blown away every year.

Mr. JEFFORDS.

Ratification of the CTBT is one of the single most important steps the Senate could take today to improve our national security and reduce the future threat of a missile attack. This treaty exists only because the United States made it a priority and put a lot of energy into its formulation. Entry into force of the treaty will now occur only if the U.S. Senate engages these issues directly and begins the ratification debate. I realize that many of my colleagues do not support the treaty. But I think most Senators would agree that this is an important debate, one that should not be allowed to slip off the Senate's fall agenda. 
The amendment before the Senate would fully fund the Administration's request for $28.9 million to cover the U.S. contribution to the Comprehensive Test Ban Preparatory Commission. This organization will be responsible for coordinating the efforts of the CTBT signatories to monitor compliance with the treaty and seek to prevent break-out of the treaty. The organization plans to build 171 monitoring stations around the world, greatly enhancing the ability of the U.S. and other countries to detect a nuclear explosion. 
Not only is this function critically important to our national security, it comes at a bargain price: the U.S. pays only 25 percent of the cost of the Preparatory Commission. The remainder is borne by the other signatories to the treaty. As we struggle to stretch every defense dollar a bit further, I don't think we can afford to let this bargain escape us.  
Mr. President, I know there are many obstacles to entry into force of the CTBT. And without active, engaged U.S. leadership, it might never happen. But we have a lot at stake here, both for today's security needs and to prevent future nuclear weapons threats. It is much easier to prevent the emergence of such threats than it is to protect against them once they have been developed. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is always a very difficult subject when we talk about nuclear waste. We all have a fear of nuclear waste and the thought of radiation emanating from the ground in our neighborhoods or visions of trucks driving down from Maine and Vermont and dumping waste into the fields of Texas. That is sometimes what is described. But we are talking here about a well-conceived law which has set out a process for low-level waste. 
What is low-level waste? Well, it is the gloves that come from the workers in the atomic energy plants. It may be waste from the utilization of radioactive materials in our hospitals. It is not the large nuclear rods that we are trying desperately to put somewhere. We are talking about something that is easily controllable. One would certainly ask this question: If there is so much problem, how come all the people in the area are voting and saying, yes, yes, bring it down? Why? Because there is a price tag to those States that have the waste. 
Vermont and Maine are not very big States. We are going to be spending $25 million sending it down, with other payments later, and creating a facility in this area that will provide jobs and economic help to an area that right now is very low income, with no real productivity or resources. So they will have an opportunity to benefit very substantially--maybe build a new school, or other things--which would not happen were it not for this compact. Also, we know well now how we can control the nuclear waste from facilities that have low-level waste. We know what to do with the high-level waste, but we just can't get the States to come around to accepting it. That is a problem for the future. Right now we are talking about low-level waste. 
The compact has the support of the Governors and the State legislatures of Texas, Vermont and Maine. Passage of this compact will allow these States to responsibly manage low-level waste produced by hospitals, power plants, industrial facilities, and medical research laboratories in our State where we do not have a place to do this, and it creates a danger. Whereas, if it is shipped and properly handled and placed in areas where there is no chance to get into the groundwater and all these things we have to worry about in our State, it can only benefit those, and especially in providing schools and other things. 
We come to the floor today asking that our states be given the same rights as forty-one other states. In 1980, and again in 1985, Congress declared that states must provide for the disposal of commercial low-level radioactive waste. Forty-one states have responded affirmatively to that mandate and formed nine regional compacts. 
These nine compacts have been approved unanimously by the Senate, without amendment, and signed into law. We ask for nothing more than what Congress has already given these forty-one other states. 
This compact, like the nine others that precede it, took years of negotiating among the states. The Vermont legislature and the Governor carefully reviewed each provision before approval. In fact in 1990, under the leadership of then-Governor Madeline Kunin, the State of Vermont began a study to find a suitable site for a disposal facility in Vermont. After two years of exhaustive review, the State determined that a safe site could not be found in Vermont. 
It is understandable that we can't bury things. We have water that flows down on us and runs off. It is no place to handle this kind of thing. 
The agreement Vermont and Maine have reached with Texas is the best option for safe disposal. In fact, the compact we are debating requires that it is the policy of the party states to cooperate in the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of their citizens and the environment. 
We are here today because one Senator is questioning the science used to find a safe and suitable site for disposal of this waste. I commend him for questioning this, and I am glad we are having this debate, because people should be reassured and should know what happens in these cases. 
After the compact was signed into law by then-Governor Ann Richards, the State of Texas launched a rigorous process to assure that the site licensed to accept this waste would be safe. Prior to selecting the proposed site, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission spent four years reviewing the site before issuing a draft license and environmental assessment. 
Although this compact does not specify a site for the Texas waste facility, I trust that the State of Texas has used and will continue to use strict scientific criteria in selecting a disposal site. 
This compact has strong bipartisan support. The consent legislation was reported out of both the House Commerce Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee without amendment and without opposition. 
The Texas Compact was adopted by the House by a vote of 309 to 107. In the Senate it passed with unanimous support. Moreover, the Texas legislature, the Maine legislature, and the Vermont legislature approved the compact. 
Mr. President, we should continue to work together in a bipartisan manner and pass this compact. 
Let's ensure that institutions in Maine, Texas, Vermont and all across the United States have access to safe disposal sites for low-level radioactive waste. 
Let's treat this compact just like we have treated all of the other nine. This compact is not about the virtues or vices of nuclear power, industrial development or cancer research, it is about the safe disposal of low-level waste. 
Let's pass this compact. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today with my friend and colleague, Senator Leahy, I introduce the Rural Opportunities Empowerment Act of 1998--a bipartisan bill that will do a great deal to assist urban and rural areas develop communities in economic need. 
The legislation will do a number of things. It builds off the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which authorized 20 rural and urban Empowerment Zones, and creates new opportunities for those communities desperately in need of federal assistance, but unable to access those funds. 
Our legislation will help scores of communities across the country seeking to improve their local economy through desperately needed federal funds. Within our legislation, monies are provided for the 20 Empowerment Zones authorized last year. Also, new grants are created for communities that are not able or eligible to compete for the EZ Round II competition this fall. Additional points will be given to those Enterprise Communities who have met a high standard of performance and who are seeking to be designated as an Empowerment Zone. Finally, a small amount of money will be provided to the Secretary to reward so-called `Top Performers,' and allow them to be able to continue their operations so additional goals of their strategic plan are met. 
Mr. President, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities provide critical resources for those rural and urban areas in economic distress. Many of these communities intend to apply for a Round II Empowerment Zone designation. Vermont's old North End in Burlington, for example, has met numerous milestones in their strategic plan by successfully leveraging additional monies from the private sources. If Congress does not pass this legislation there will be no funding. Burlington's application for an Empowerment Zone designation under Round II this fall will be useless. 
Providing rehabilitation and tax breaks to businesses who are interested in investing in a depressed area has been an impressive success in Burlington and elsewhere and my legislation will not only allow Burlington to compete for Empowerment Zone status in Round II, but it will also require HUD to disseminate best EC practices to other ECs around the country who may not be performing as impressively. This legislation is not only good for rural and urban communities, it is good government. 
I ask my colleagues to work with me and with Senator Leahy to ensure that this legislation is passed in the short time we have left in the 105th Congress. I will be working with the Finance Committee to ensure that this Congress does not forget those communities who look toward the federal government to provide incentives for the private sector to invest in economically depressed areas.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in October of last year I held a hearing on `HIV/AIDS: Recent Developments and Future Opportunities.' A good portion of that hearing was devoted to a discussion on the blood crisis of the 1980s, resulting in the HIV infection of thousands of Americans who trusted that the blood or blood product with which they were treated was safe. Witnesses at the hearing included John Williams, the father of a child who contracted HIV from the clotting factor and died at the age of 18, and Donna McCullough, a young woman who contracted HIV when she received a blood transfusion after a miscarriage. Although Ms. McCullough remains relatively healthy, she lost her only son to AIDS. Ms. McCullough did not know of her own infection until her infant son was diagnosed. 
The tragedy of the blood supply's infection has brought unbearable pain to families all over the country. I have heard from dozens, perhaps hundreds of them over the past months. As Mr. Williams testified, the community hit by this tragedy has found it nearly impossible to make recovery through the courts because of blood shield laws in most states that raise the burden of proof for product liability claims for blood and blood products. In addition, all States have statutes of limitations that prohibit litigation if the suit was not filed within a certain period of time. Other witnesses spoke of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and the hesitancy many felt to bring suit and thus be public about their infection. 
My heart goes out to the victims and families of this terrible tragedy. I sincerely hope that we will, in this Congress, bring some peace to these families with the passage of the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act. The House passed this bill by voice vote on May 19, 1998. Its companion in the Senate was introduced by Senators DeWine and Graham, and I have pledged to move that bill forward in my Committee. 
Sadly, the Ricky Ray bill as introduced does not include all victims of the blood supply crisis. I feel strongly that the bill we pass in the Senate must include not only hemophiliacs, but also people who received a blood transfusion or blood product in the course of medical treatment for other illnesses. Transfusion-associated AIDS victims are subject to the same laws that Mr. Williams mentioned. While in some cases individuals in this group were able to track the source of their infection and bring suit against the blood bank, the vast majority were not. 
There is the perception that most transfusion cases recovered millions of dollars in court, and that is simply not the case. Fewer than 10%--and the most credible estimates put the number at 2%--of transfusion cases made any financial recovery. Even among those transfusion cases who reached settlement the majority recovered far less than the reputed millions, the average settlement for transfusion cases is more like $40,000. 
I am introducing today an amendment to the House passed HR 1023 in the nature of a substitute. While the change to include transfusion cases increases the cost of this bill, many have already noted that this bill is not about money, it's about fairness. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the terrible tragedy the blood supply crisis of the 1980s bestowed upon all of its victims.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am releasing a new U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report entitled `Private Health Insurance: Impact of Premium Increases on the Number of Covered Individuals Is Uncertain' (GAO/HEHS-98-203R). In November, 1997, the Lewin Group published a study that estimates for every one percent increase in health insurance premiums, 400,000 people would lose their health care coverage. This GAO report assesses the methodology used in the Lewin Group report and evaluates the factors that could determine how premium increases relate to the number of individuals with health insurance coverage. 
Over the past 14 months, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources has held nine hearings on issues relating to health care quality and two hearings on ways to increase health insurance coverage. At each of these hearings, the point was made that proposed health care legislation could increase the cost of health care and have the unintended consequence of reducing the number of individuals covered by employer-sponsored health care. 
The GAO report found several problems with the original November, 1997, Lewin Group estimate. GAO concluded that, based on a more recent Lewin Group report, if health insurance premiums increase by 1 percent for only some types of insurance (for example, HMOs), then the coverage loss would be less than 300,000. 
The first concern identified by the GAO with the November, 1997, Lewin Group report is that it was based on the effects of insurance premium subsidies on an employer's decision to offer insurance. The Lewin Group concluded from its studies that a one percent decrease in premiums would induce employers to offer coverage to an additional 400,000 employees. The Lewin Group then assumed that this same relationship could be reversed to represent accurately the number of employees who would lose coverage if premiums increased. The GAO analysis concludes that a more important variable in assessing the impact on health insurance coverage is not whether an employer decides to offer insurance coverage, but whether an employee will choose to accept it. 
According to the Current Population Survey data, in 1996, about 70 percent of the population under the age of 65 was covered by health insurance purchased through an employer or purchased privately. About 12 percent of the population was covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services. And the remaining 18 percent of the population was uninsured. 
Between 1987 and 1996, the number of workers who were offered insurance by their employers rose from 72.4 percent to 75.4 percent; but, at the same time, the number of workers who accepted coverage actually fell from 88.3 percent to 80.1 percent. There could be several reasons for this declining acceptance rate. In 1988, employees in small firms with fewer than 200 workers paid an average of 12 percent of their premiums. However, by 1996, the employees' premium contributions had risen to 33 percent. Also, during this same period, the States were expanding the eligibility requirements for their Medicaid programs, and the real incomes of workers declined. 
The studies available to the Lewin Group in preparing their November, 1997, report were primarily focused on an employer's decision to offer coverage, not on the relationship between the cost of insurance and the number of individuals covered by insurance. These studies also varied widely in their research questions and their findings. Some of the older studies used data from 1971 and earlier. 
The second factor identified by the GAO was the release by the Lewin Group, in January, 1998, of a revised estimate of the coverage loss due to health care premium increases. The Lewin Group now believes that approximately 300,000 people could lose their employer-sponsored coverage for every one percent increase in premiums. The new estimate is based on a new statistical analysis of the relationship between what employees pay for health insurance, and the likelihood that their families have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. 
The Lewin Group estimates also assume equal premium increases for all types of insurance products. Since the legislation that Congress is considering will primarily affect HMO premiums, employees faced with higher premiums may switch to other types of insurance rather than drop coverage entirely. Based on the work of the Barents Group, the GAO found that this change in plans by employees would further reduce the Lewin Group estimate to a number less than 300,000. 
In conclusion, the GAO report indicates that if health insurance premiums increase by one percent for only some types of insurance (for example, HMOs), then the coverage loss predicted by the Lewin Group would be less than 300,000. However, the GAO urges that this figure must be used cautiously. There are still many factors that were not included in the Lewin Group estimate, such as: changes in benefits offered by an insurance plan; changes in real wages; and what percentage of a premium increase is passed on from the employer to the employee. 
Mr. President, as we consider legislation to ensure that Americans have access to high-quality health care, we must also be concerned that new health plan requirements do not lead to increased numbers of the uninsured. The GAO report, `Private Health Insurance: Impact of Premium Increases on the Number of Covered Individuals Is Uncertain,' will be a valuable resource for the Congress in achieving an appropriate balance between these two important societal goals.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed the Workforce Investment Act conference report, H.R. 1385. This legislation makes important reforms to our job training, adult education, and vocational rehabilitation programs. 
The Workforce Investment Act is one of the most significant proposals that has passed the Senate this year. H.R. 1385 proposes a streamlined, practical, business-oriented approach to job training which empowers states with the ability to transform a current patchwork of programs into a comprehensive system. 
This bill is the result of more than four years of hard work. The last Congress, under the leadership of Senator Nancy Kassebaum, spent a considerable amount of time on similar legislation. Senator Kassebaum did not act alone in championing the workforce legislation in the last Congress. Senator DeWine, Senator Kennedy and myself and many other members were also involved in that effort. 
Senator Kennedy and I have been working on job training legislation for over two decades. I count the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), which I co-authored along with Representative Hawkins and Senators Kennedy, Hatch, and Quayle as a significant legislative accomplishment. Today, over twenty years later, it is clear that JTPA is not sufficient to meet the increasing demands being made on our education and training system. 
The Workforce Investment Act conference report as passed by the Senate will enable states to better coordinate employment and training programs and related activities, with a special emphasis on coordinating adult education and job training initiatives. This coordination will lead to customer satisfaction--which is perhaps the most important aspect of this bill. Individuals seeking job training and adult education services will choose to enroll in high quality programs which will lead to better paying jobs. In addition, employers will also be satisfied customers because they will have the ability to hire better skilled employees. 
The Workforce Investment Act is a product of many efforts. In particular, I would like to thank Senator Mike DeWine, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training for his leadership in this area. He has done an outstanding job in putting this bill together and his contribution regarding the redesigning of our youth training programs will be of great benefit to our nation's disadvantaged youth. I would also like to thank Senator Paul Wellstone, the Employment and Training Subcommittee's ranking member for his work on the bill. 
Senator Ted Kennedy and I have been working for many years on employment and training issues. The Workforce Investment Act has been a bipartisan effort. I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for his leadership. 
Not only has this been a bipartisan effort, but it has also been bicameral. Representative Bill Goodling, the chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee and the chair of this conference has also been working on job training legislation for over twenty years. I commend him on his leadership and thank him for all of his hard work in completing action on H.R. 1385. 
Chairman Goodling was joined by Representative Bill Clay, Representative Buck McKeon, and Representative Dale Kildee. This bill is a product of their expertise and commitment to improving job training and adult education. 
In addition, I would like to thank the staff of the Congressional Research Service: Ann Lordeman, Rick Apling, and Paul Irwin. I would also like to thank the Legislative Counsel staff: Liz King, Mark Sigurski, and Mark Synnes. Their dedication and hard work were essential in completing the Workforce Investment Act Conference Report. 
In May of 1997, I held a hearing at Vermont Technical College in Randolph, Vermont. The testimony that I received at that hearing was my touchstone for the Workforce Investment Act. Witness after witness discussed the urgency for a skilled workforce. I would like to thank my home state of Vermont for serving as an inspiration for this legislation. I would especially like to thank Susan Auld, the Commissioner for Vermont's Department of Employment and Training, and Kathy Finck, the director of Vermont's Adult and Vocational Education program for their contributions to this legislation. 
As I mentioned earlier, customer satisfaction, flexibility, and stronger accountability are the themes of H.R. 1385. A provision of the bill which relates to these issues is the ability of states to submit one plan to Washington for a variety of federal programs. This encourages states to coordinate their programs; also cuts through bureaucratic red tape by giving states the option to submit one plan versus several plans. Another provision which emphasizes the importance of customer satisfaction and accountability is the opportunity for states to be rewarded, through incentive grants, for exceeding their performance standards in delivering employment and training and education related services. 
When this bill originally passed the Senate, vocational education was a major section of the legislation. The one disappointment I have is that we were unable to include vocational education in this conference report. However, I do hope that the House and Senate conferees will be able to bring a vocational education conference report to the Congress before the October adjournment. 
The final section of the conference report is the reauthorization of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. The rehabilitation provisions in this bill will open up more employment opportunities to individuals with disabilities. They will also provide state vocational rehabilitation agencies and other agencies and organizations that offer employment-related assistance to individuals with disabilities with the tools they need to give appropriate, timely help to individuals with disabilities who want to work. These provisions bring us closer to a seamless system for job training and employment assistance for individuals with disabilities. 
The Workforce Investment Act lays the groundwork to establish an outstanding employment and training system nationwide that will meet the economic demands of the next century. The business community and the Administration have been very helpful in this endeavor. I want to especially thank Secretary Herman and Secretary Riley and their staffs for their work and who literally worked on this legislation up to the last minute. The passage of H.R. 1385 means that this nation will have a better skilled workforce.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Conservation Tax Incentives Act of 1998, a bill that will result in a reduction in the capital gains tax for landowners who sell property for conservation purposes. This bill creates a new incentive for private, voluntary land protection. This legislation is a cost-effective non-regulatory, market-based approach to conservation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it. 
The tax code's charitable contribution deduction currently provides an incentive to taxpayers who give land away for conservation purposes. That is, we already have a tax incentive to encourage people to donate land or conservation easements to government agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service or to citizens' groups like the Vermont Land Trust. This incentive has been instrumental in the conservation of environmentally significant land across the country. 
Not all land worth preserving, however, is owned by people who can afford to give it away. For many landowners, their land is their primary financial asset, and they cannot afford to donate it for conservation purposes. While they might like to see their land preserved in its underdeveloped state, the tax code's incentive for donations is of no help. 
The Conservation Tax Incentives Act will provide a new tax incentive for sales of land for conservation by reducing the amount of income that landowners would ordinarily have to report--and pay tax on--when they sell their land. The bill provides that when land is sold for conservation purposes, only one half of any gain will be included in income. The other half can be excluded from income, and the effect of this exclusion is to cut in half the capital gains tax the seller would otherwise have to pay. The bill will apply to land and to partial interests in land and water. 
It will enable landowners to permanently protect a property's environmental value without forgoing the financial security it provides. The bill's benefits are available to landowners who sell land either to a government agency or to a qualified conservation nonprofit organization, as long as the land will be used for such conservation purposes as protection of fish, wildlife or plant habitat, or as open space for agriculture, forestry, outdoor recreation or scenic beauty. 
Land is being lost to development and commercial use at an alarming rate. By Department of Agriculture estimates, more than four square miles of farmland are lost to development every day, often with devastating effects on the habitat wildlife need to 
thrive. Without additional incentives for conservation, we will continue to lose ecologically valuable land. 
A real-life example from my home state illustrates the need for this bill. A few years ago, in an area of Vermont known as the Northeast Kingdom, a large well-managed forested property came on the market. The land had appreciated greatly over the years and was very valuable commercially. With more than 3,000 acres of mountains, forests, and ponds, with hiking trails, towering cliffs, scenic views and habitat for many wildlife species, the property was very valuable environmentally. Indeed, the State of Vermont was anxious to acquire it and preserve it for traditional agricultural uses and habitat conservation. 
After the property had been on the market for a few weeks, the seller was contacted by an out-of-state buyer who planned to sell the timber on the land and to dispose of the rest of the property for development. After learning of this, the State quickly moved to obtain appraisals and a legislative appropriation in preparation for a possible purchase of the land by the State. Subsequently, the State and The Nature Conservancy made a series of purchase offers to the landowner. The out-of-state buyer however, prevailed upon the landowner to accept his offer. Local newspaper headlines read, `State of Vermont Loses Out On Northeast Kingdom Land Deal.' The price accepted by the landowner was only slightly higher than the amount the State had offered. Had the bill I'm introducing today been on the books, the lower offer by the State may well have been as attractive--perhaps more so--than the amount offered by the developer. 
This bill provides an incentive-based means for accomplishing conservation in the public interest. It helps tax dollars accomplish more, allowing public and charitable conservation funds to go to higher-priority conservation projects. Preliminary estimates indicate that with the benefits of this bill, nine percent more land could be acquired, with no increase in the amount governments currently spend for conservation land acquisition. At a time when little money is available for conservation, it is important that we stretch as far as possible the dollars that are available. 
State and local governments will be important beneficiaries of this bill. Many local communities have voted in favor of raising taxes to finance bond initiatives to acquire land for conservation. My bill will help stretch these bond proceeds so that they can go further in improving the conservation results for local communities. In addition, because the bill applies to sales to publicly-supported national, regional, State and local citizen conservation groups, its provisions will strengthen private, voluntary work to save places important to the quality of life in communities across the country. Private fundraising efforts for land conservation will be enhanced by this bill, as funds will be able to conserve more, or more valuable, land. 
Let me provide an example to show how I intend the bill to work. Let's suppose that in 1952 a young couple purchased a house and a tract of adjoining land, which 
they have maintained as open land. Recently, the county where they lived passed a bond initiative to buy land for open space, as county residents wanted to protect the quality of their life from rampant development and uncontrolled sprawl. Let's further assume that the couple, now contemplating retirement, is considering competing offers for their land, one from a developer, the other from the county, which will preserve the land in furtherance of its open-space goals. Originally purchased for $25,000, the land is now worth $250,000 on the open market. If they sell the land to the developer for its fair market value, the couple would realize a gain of $225,000 ($250,000 sales price minus $25,000 costs), owe tax of $45,000 (at a rate of 20% on the $225,000 gain), and thus net $205,000 after tax. 
Under my bill, if the couple sold the land for conservation purposes, they could exclude from income one half of any gain they realized upon the sale. This means they would pay a lower capital gains tax; consequently, they would be in a position to accept a lower offer from a local government or a conservation organization, yet still end up with more money in their pockets than they would have had if they had accepted the developer's offer. Continuing with the example from the preceding paragraph, let's assume the couple sold the property to the county, for the purpose of conservation, at a price of $240,000. They would realize a gain of $215,000 ($240,000 sales price minus $25,000 cost). Under my bill, only half of this gain $107,500, would be includible in income. The couple would pay $21,500 in capital gains tax (at a rate of 20% on the $107,500 gain includible in income) and thus net $218,500 ($240,000 sales price minus $21,500 tax). Despite having accepted a sales price $10,000 below the developer's offer, the couple will keep $13,000 more than they would have kept if they had accepted his offer. 
The end result is a win both for the landowners, who end up with more money in their pocket than they would have had after a sale to an outsider, and for the local community, which is able to preserve the land at a lower price. This example illustrates how the exclusion from income will be especially beneficial to middle-income, `land rich/cash poor' landowners who can't avail themselves of the tax benefits available to those who can afford to donate land. 
As this bill also applies to partial interests in land, the exclusion from income--and the resulting reduction in capital gains tax--will, in certain instances, also be available to landowners selling partial interests in their land for conservation purposes. A farmer could, for example, sell a conservation easement, continuing to remain on and farm his land, yet still be able to take advantage of the provisions in this bill. The conservation easement must meet the tax code's requirements i.e., it must serve a conservation purpose, such as the protection of fish or wildlife habitat or the preservation of open space (including farmland and forest land). 
There are some things this bill does not do. It does not impose new regulations or controls on people who own environmentally-sensitive land. It does not compel anyone to do anything; it is entirely voluntary. Nor will it increase government spending for land conservation. In fact, the effect of this bill will be to allow better investment of tax and charitable dollars used for land conservation. 
The estimated cost of this bill is just $50 million annually. This modest cost, however, does not take into account the value of the land conserved. It is estimated that for every dollar foregone by the Federal treasury, $1.76 in land will be permanently preserved. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in support of the Conservation Tax Incentives Act of 1998.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join Senator Moynihan in offering legislation that would reduce the sulfur content of gasoline. Current levels of sulfur in gasoline lead to high nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon emissions by weakening catalytic converter emission controls. These emissions elevate ground-level ozone and particulate matter pollution. 
As we all have learned, long-term exposure to ozone pollution can have significant health impacts, including asthma attacks, breathing and respiratory problems, loss of lung function, and lowered immunity to disease. The EPA has compared breathing ozone to getting a sunburn in your lungs. Children, including Vermont's approximately 10,000 asthmatic children, are at special risk for adverse health effects from ozone pollution. Children playing outside in the summer time, the season when concentrations of ground-level ozone are the greatest, may suffer from coughing, decreased lung function, and have trouble catching their breath. Exposure to particulate matter pollution is similarly dangerous causing premature death, increased respiratory symptoms and disease, decreased lung function, and alterations in lung tissue. These pollutants also result in adverse environmental effects such as acid rain and visibility impairment. 
Mr. President, this bill will reduce these pollutants in our communities, and more importantly it will reduce these pollutants cost-effectively. To reduce the sulfur content of gasoline, refineries can use currently available technology. These measures will not break the bank. California has already adopted the measures in this bill on a statewide basis. So have Japan and the members of the European Union. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Let's clean up our air so we can all breathe just a little bit easier.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, August 15, 1998, will be a great day for Vermont as we celebrate the centennial of the Proctor Fire Department/Sutherland Falls Hose Company. On behalf of all Vermonters, I want to wish the department a very happy birthday. 
For a century, the Proctor Fire Department has been a vital part of its community. The firefighters continually risk their lives to protect the welfare of their neighbors. One such person was Firefighter Maurice `Sonny' Wardwell, a twenty-three year veteran of the department. He gave his life on January 23, 1994, while at the scene of a mutual aid fire in Pittsford, Vermont. Mr. Wardwell is a true hero and his sacrifice serves as a reminder to us all of dedication and selflessness of this profession. 
Mr. President, the 100th birthday of the Proctor Fire Department/Sutherland Falls Hose Company is a monumental occasion. The department is a vital part of the town and provides prompt and reliable service to people in the most distressing situations. This tribute recognizes the importance of the Proctor Fire Department/Sutherland Falls Hose Company and, more importantly, the courageous firefighters who commit their time and service to the community.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his very eloquent description of the legislation, which makes it entirely unnecessary for me to go further. I appreciate the kind comments he made. 
As he pointed out, this is an example of bipartisanship as well. Senator Wellstone and Senator Kennedy, on the other side of the aisle, participated always in a constructive way and allowed us to come up with an excellent piece of legislation. 
On the House side, Congressman Goodling, my good friend and colleague for many years, as chairman of the committee, and Congressman Clay, whom I also worked with in the past and to the present, Congressman McKeon of California, and Congressman Kildee of Michigan--all participated in this conference report. 
It could not have been done without the fantastic help of our staff. The committee personnel, CRS, and legislative counsel, and DOL, Department of Education, the White House--all participated in bringing to fruition a piece of legislation which has been struggling for 4 years to be able to get there.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Vermont in recognizing September 13th as the 150th Anniversary of Phineas Gage's accident in Cavendish, VT. Gage was clearing away boulders for a new rail line in the town of Cavendish, population 1300, when an explosion sent his tamping rod passing through his skull and landing 30 yards away. It initially appeared that Gage had survived the accident without long term effects. However, soon after the accident, it became apparent that his emotional stability and good attitude had changed forever offering insight into the effects of the frontal lobe brain damage on mental function. 
Earlier this year,Vermont Governor Howard Dean signed a proclamation declaring September 13, 1998 as Phineas Gage 150th Anniversary Commemoration Day. On this day, accompanying the historic festival, Cavendish will host the John Martyn Harlow Frontal Lobe Symposium. John Harlow, Gage's doctor, carefully documented Gage's accident and recovery, providing early insight into frontal lobe brain damage. The symposium will draw experts and scholars from around the globe to reexamine the Gage case, and apply modern technology to better understand the connection between brain damage and personality change. 
I join my colleague from Vermont in commending the residents of Cavendish for bringing together their town, the state of Vermont, and the international neurological community to celebrate this Vermont legend and the medical breakthrough surrounding his life.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the amendment before us on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill concerns the provision of child care services located in federally-owned and -leased buildings. This amendment will go a long way towards ensuring that child care services located in federally-owned and leased buildings are safe, positive environments for the children of federal employees. 
I have been working closely with the Senate Committee on Government Affairs which has jurisdiction over this legislation. Chairman Thompson and his staff have been extremely helpful, as has the ranking member of that committee, Senator Glenn. The Senate Rules Committee was instrumental in crafting the language related to the Senate Employees' Child Care Center. I want to thank Chairman Warner, and Senator Ford and their staff for their assistance. 
This amendment was first introduced as a stand-alone bill on November 7, 1997. It was drafted because of several serious incidents which occurred in federal child care facilities. At that time, it came to my attention that child care centers located in federal facilities are not subject to even the most minimal health and safety standards. 
As my colleagues know, federal property is exempt from state and local laws, regulations, and oversight. What this means for child care centers on federal property is that state and local health safety standards do not and cannot apply. This might not be a problem if federally-owned or leased child care centers met enforceable health and safety standards. I think most parents who place their children in federal child care would assume that this would be the case. However, I think federal employees will find it very surprising to learn, as I did, that, at many centers, no such health and safety standards apply. 
I find this very troubling, and I think we should be embarassed that child care in federal facilities child care cannot guarantee that children are in safe environments. The federal government should set the example when it comes to providing safe child care. It should not turn an apathetic shoulder from meeting such standards simply because state and local regulations do not apply to them. 
My amendment will require child care services in federal buildings to meet a standard no less stringent than the requirements for the same type of child care offered in the community in which the federal child care center is located. The child care provider would not be required to obtain a state or local license, although that is an option open to them. The Government Services Administration would be responsible for establishing the rules and regulations necessary to ensure that each child care facility in a federal building meets the same level of standards applicable to other child care services in the community. 
In 1987, Congress passed the `Trible amendment' which permitted executive, legislative, and judicial branch agencies to utilize a portion of federally-owned or leased space for the provision of child care services for federal employees. The General Services Administration (GSA) was given the authority to provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to federal agencies for the development of child care centers. In the decade since the Trible amendment was passed, hundreds of federal facilities throughout the nation have established on-site child care centers which are a tremendous help to our employees. 
The General Services Administration has done an excellent job of helping agencies develop child care centers and have adopted strong standards for those centers located in GSA-leased or -owned space. However, there are over 100 child care centers located in federal facilities that are not subject to the GSA standards or any other laws, rules, or regulations to ensure that the facilities are safe places for our children. Most parents, placing their children in a federal child care center, assume that some standards are in place--assume that the centers must minimally meet state and local child care licensing rules and regulations. They assume that the centers are subject to independent oversight and monitoring to continually ensure the safety of the premises. 
Yet, that is not the case. In one case a federal employee had strong reason to suspect the sexual abuse of her child by an employee of child care center located in a federal facility. Local child protective services and law enforcement personnel were denied access to the premises and were prohibited from investigating the incident. Another employee's child was repeatedly injured because the child care providers under contract with a federal agency to provide on-site child care services failed to ensure that age-appropriate health and safety measures were taken--current law says they were not required to do so, even after the problems were identified and injuries had occurred. 
In addition, I believe that the federal government can and should lead by example. Federal facilities should always try to meet the highest possible standards. In fact, the GSA has required national accreditation in GSA-owned and leased facilities, and has 
stated that its centers are either in compliance or are strenuously working to get there. This is the kind of tough standard we should strive for in all of our federal child care facilities. 
For that reason, this amendment requires that within five years, all child care services located within federal facilities must become accredited by a professionally recognized child care accreditation entity. While state and local child care requirements generally ensure that those services meet the basic health and safety needs, child care credentialling entities go further. Accreditation also includes requirements that developmentally appropriate activities are an integral part of the program, that staff is trained, and that the program is a positive environment that contributes to the healthy development of children receiving child care services. 
There are several child care accreditation entities providing these services around the country. The National Council for Private School Accreditation is a coalition of 13 entities providing private school accreditation, many of which issue credentials to child care service providers. The Council on Accreditation of Services for Families and Children, Inc. has developed standards and guidelines that are used by several child care accreditation entities to ensure a high quality of care for children. The National Association for the Education of Young Children provides accreditation for child care centers throughout the country. The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod has been accrediting child care services longer than any other entity. 
Child care providers in federally-owned and leased facilities will be able to choose which child care accreditation they will obtain. In addition, the General Services Administration is permitted to develop a child care accreditation process to add to the choices already available to programs in federal facilities. 
Federal child care should mean something more than simply a location in a federal facility. The federal government has an obligation to provide safe care for the children of its employees, and it has a responsibility for making sure that those standards are monitored and enforced. Some federal employees receive this guarantee. Many do not. We can and must do better. 
Senators Landrieu and Dodd are original co-sponsors of this amendment. I urge my colleagues to help ensure high quality child care in federally owned and leased facilities by supporting this amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, over the past few years we have become increasingly aware of the need to improve women's health. I am an original cosponsor of S. 766, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act and am proud to support Senators Snowe and Reid today in their amendment to ensure contraception coverage for all women covered by the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. 
I held a hearing on this issue in the committee on Labor and Human Resources on July 21, 1998, and am pleased to see interest in and support for this issue growing. It has been too long in coming, but I am glad to have the opportunity to be part of providing equity in health care for women. I look forward to the day when all American women will enjoy the same equity in coverage this amendment provides to women employed by the federal government. 
Out-of-pocket health care expenses for women are 68 percent higher than those for men, and most of the difference is due to noncovered reproductive health care. It is disturbing how rapidly some insurance plans began covering Viagra when it has taken so long for many of them to begin covering contraceptives. This bill helps achieve gender equity in health benefits, and its passage would be a victory for women across the Nation. 
`EPIC' provides that if a health insurance plan covers benefits for other FDA-approved prescription drugs or devices, it also must cover benefits for FDA-approved prescription contraceptive drugs or devices. Further, `EPIC' provides that if the plan covers benefits for other outpatient services provided by a health care professional, it also must cover outpatient contraceptive services. 
The bill does not require special treatment of prescription contraceptives or outpatient contraceptive services compared to other prescription drugs or outpatient care. 
Each year more than half of all pregnancies in the United States--approximately 3.6 million pregnancies--are unintended, and almost half of all unintended pregnancies end in abortion. Reducing unintended pregnancies by making effective contraception more widely available would reduce the need for abortion. For that reason, surveys suggest that most people favor increasing coverage of contraception by health insurance plans. 
The vast majority of private insurers cover prescription drugs, but many exclude coverage for prescription contraceptives. In contrast to the lack of coverage for reversible contraception, most plans do cover abortion and sterilization. 
The gender equity issue has been highlighted recently by the willingness of many health insurance plans to cover Viagra. A Kaiser Family Foundation national survey on insurance coverage of contraception conducted in May of this year demonstrated that 75 percent of Americans 18 years and older supported coverage of contraception, but only 49 percent supported coverage of Viagra. 
The Health Insurance Association of America (HIAA) has estimated that the extra cost to employers who do not now cover reversible medical methods of contraception is about $16 per employee per year--or less than one percent of current health care premiums.

Mr. JEFFORDS. 
Mr. President, I rise today to argue in support of an amendment sponsored by myself and Senator Baucus that would require the U.S. Postal Service to let communities know when they are planning to shut down, relocate, or consolidate a community's post office. This amendment aims to preserve the fabric of downtowns and prevent sprawl by giving citizens a say in Postal Service decisions to close, relocate, or consolidate their local post office. 
This amendment is supported by the National Governors Association, the National League of Cities, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the National Association of Postmasters of the United States, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, the American Planning Association, the Association of United States Postal Lessors, and the International Downtown Association. 
Coming from a small town in Vermont, I understand the importance downtowns or village centers play in the identity and longevity of a community. Downtowns are where people go to socialize, shop, learn what their elected representatives are doing, and gather to celebrate holidays with their neighbors. 
One of the focal points of any downtown area is the community's post office. Post offices have been part of downtowns and village centers as long as most cities and towns have existed. These post offices are often located in historic buildings and have provided towns with a sense of continuity as their communities have changed over time. The removal of this focal point can quickly lead to the disappearance of continuity and spirit of a community and then the community itself. 
Mr. President, this amendment will enable the inhabitants of small villages and large towns to have a say when the Postal Service decides that their local post office will be closed, relocated, or consolidated. Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is necessary. A few stories from my home state of Vermont will answer this question. 
A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, Vermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the small village center for a new building outside of town. By the time the community was aware of the project, plans were so far along--the new building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the post office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully investigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in contrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, `we certainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more to get our mail.' The State Historic Preservation Officer commented that as people meet neighbors at the post office, the threads of community are woven and reinforced. `It may be intangible, but its real, and such interaction is critically important to the preservation of the spirit and physical fabric of small village centers like Perkinsville.' 
In 1988, the post office in the Stockbridge, Vermont, General Store needed to expand. The store owner tried to find money to rehabilitate an 1811 barn next to the store to provide the needed space, but was not successful. In 1990, the post office moved into a new facility located on the outskirts of Stockbridge on a previously undeveloped section of land at the intersection of two highways. People can no longer walk to the post office as they once were able to do when it was located in the village center. The relocation of the Stockbridge post office unfortunately removed one of the anchors of the community. 
These are not isolated examples. 
Mr. President, post office relocations are not only occurring in Vermont, but all across the country. My colleagues will quickly discover similar examples in their own states where the removal of the post office has harmed the economic vitality of the downtown area, deprived access to citizens without cars, and contributed to urban sprawl. 
The basic premise for this legislation is to give the individuals in a community a voice in the process of a proposed relocation, closing or consolidation of a post office. This community voice has been lacking in the current process. This bill does not give the citizenry the ultimate veto power over a relocation, closing or consolidation. Instead, the bill sets up a process that makes sure community voices and concerns are heard and taken into account by the Postal Service. 
Additionally, this act will require the Postal Service to abide by local zoning laws and the historic preservation rules regarding federal buildings. Because it is a federal entity, the Postal Service has the ability to override local zoning requirements. In some cases this has lead to disruption of traffic patterns, a rejection of local safety standards, and concerns about environmental damage from problems such as storm water management. 
Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are centers of social and business interaction. In communities where post offices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become integral to these communities' identities. I believe that this legislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal Service, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and me in support of this important amendment. 
This is a simple amendment. I can't believe it can't be accepted. 
Vermonters are tired of waking up in the morning and finding out their post office will be somewhere else. Under the proposed rule, all they get is a notice in the mail. There is no public hearing required. There is no way to appeal. It is just given carte blanche as to what they want to do. 
In one little town in Vermont, they found out their post office moved 2 miles outside of town, and the people who had gathered in the village, a lot of the reason they gathered in the village was to be able to walk to the post office. They have to go 2 miles to get their mail. 
No notice, no ability to participate at all. Blanket exemption for many zoning rules. They don't have to even take care of what the planning for the town has been. There is an exemption from the historic preservation rule. It says they can exempt projects from the new standards if the project is to meet an emergency requirement or is for temporary use, with no definition of what they are. 
You are at the complete mercy of the post office to stick it anywhere they want. I tell you, our post offices are up in arms over this. All we want is a simple logical way where people are notified, they get a chance to be heard, they find out where the locations are going to be, they have an opportunity to make suggestions, 
and then they get on with life. But right now the way it is, it has my people in Vermont in the small town areas deeply upset. They have got postmasters who are ready to march on Washington. Why? Because we want some simple, commonsense rules to be abided by so that there is local input as to where your next post office is going to be. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the list of things I presented is the list that the Senator from Mississippi was talking about. It doesn't do anything for you. It allows you to know and gives you a 1-day notice. You get it in the mail and you find out the next day where it is located. There is a minimum 60 days for the--there is a gross exemption, blanket exemption, of the zoning requirements. They are exempt from new standards if it is for temporary use, but there is no definition of what that is. All these things I mentioned are what we are talking about. That is why we believe very strongly that our amendment should prevail and we will work it out in conference. 
I yield whatever time I have.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am releasing a new U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report entitled, `Private Health Insurance: HCFA Cautious in Enforcing Federal HIPAA Standards in States Lacking Comparable Laws' (GAO/HEHS-98-217R). The GAO report warns that Federal involvement in the role traditionally reserved for the States may complicate oversight of private health insurance. 
In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, thereby endorsing the arrangement where States are responsible for the regulation of insurance. Federal regulation of health insurance in States establishes a new precedent. In light of current proposals that would establish additional Federal standards of health insurance, I believe we must carefully consider the appropriate role for Federal and State regulatory agencies in monitoring and enforcing compliance with insurance standards. 
As the Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I have closely monitored the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) since its enactment in the last Congress. HIPAA set new Federal standards for access, portability, and renewability for group health plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and for health insurance issuers which have traditionally been regulated by the States. Under the HIPAA framework, in the event that a State does not enact the new Federal standards for health insurance issuers, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is required to enforce the provisions. 
As of June 30, 1998, officials in California, Rhode Island, and Missouri have voluntarily notified HCFA that they have failed to enact HIPAA standards in legislation. Two other States, Massachusetts and Michigan, are widely known to have not enacted conforming legislation, but the States have not notified HCFA, nor has HCFA initiated the formal process to determine if Federal regulation is necessary. 
In the case of the five States where HIPAA standards have not been adopted, HCFA must assume several functions normally reserved for State insurance regulators. These duties include (1) responding to consumer inquiries and complaints; (2) providing guidance to carriers about HIPAA requirements; (3) obtaining and reviewing carriers' product literature and policies for compliance with HIPAA standards; (4) monitoring carrier marketing practices for compliance; and (5) imposing civil monetary penalties on carriers who fail to comply with HIPAA requirements. 
HCFA officials have acknowledged that their agency has thus far taken a minimalist approach to regulating HIPAA, and they attribute the agency's limited involvement to a lack of experienced staff, as well as uncertainty about its actual regulatory authority. Originally assuming that States would adopt HIPAA legislation, HCFA reassigned only a small number of staff members to address enforcement issues. The reassigned staff generally came from other divisions and had no previous experience in private health insurance. 
As of July, 1998, HCFA has authorized 40 full-time staff members to work on all HIPAA-related issues. HCFA officials acknowledge that these new staffers will likely focus on responding to consumer inquiries and complaints. Officials also have said that they will need additional staff to conduct any further enforcement activities. They are unable to state their precise staff needs, because they are inexperienced in the regulation of private health insurance and are uncertain of their long-term responsibility. At a Labor Committee oversight hearing in March, HCFA Commissioner Nancy-Ann Min DeParle testified that HCFA may require an additional range of enforcement tools, beyond the already-established civil monetary penalties. 
Without formal notification of noncompliance from Massachusetts and Michigan, HCFA must undertake a determination process to establish the States' nonconformance, officially providing the authority for HCFA to become involved. HCFA officials have not yet undertaken this effort, which they characterize as cumbersome. 
The GAO has found that HCFA's review of carriers' product literature and policy compliance would be restricted by the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Act establishes a process for approval of any collection information, defined as collecting information from 10 or more persons. HCFA would need to obtain approval from the Office of Management and Budget for anything other than obtaining information in response to specific consumer complaints. To fulfill its regulatory duties, HCFA would need OMB approval to collect information from all carriers on a regular basis, which most State insurance commissioners already do. 
In California, Missouri, and Rhode Island, oversight of health benefits is divided between State insurance regulators and the Department of Labor. The addition of HCFA to the array of regulatory bodies may further fragment and complicate the regulation of private health insurance. This framework may lead to duplication, yet none of these agencies will have complete authority for regulating health insurance products. Ms. DeParle herself has stated that this would be a challenging `patchwork quilt of Federal and State enforcement.' 
One example is in Missouri, where the State's present small-group, guaranteed-issue requirement is applicable to groups of 3 to 25 individuals. HIPAA's small-group guaranteed-issue standard applies to policies sold to groups of 2 to 50 individuals. Therefore, in Missouri, HCFA has the responsibility for ensuring that carriers guarantee products to groups the size of 2 individuals, and groups the size of 26 to 50 individuals. 
The legislative history of HIPAA makes clear that the Congress intended that the effect of this legislation would be that all States would come quickly into compliance with the stated Federal standards, eliminating the need for active regulation by HCFA. We are now confronted by the fact that in at least five States HCFA must initiate enforcement with respect to group to individual market coverage. 
At a March 19, 1998, Labor Committee HIPAA oversight hearing, Don Moran of the Lewin Group testified: `The lesson I take from HIPAA is that, in the complex world of health benefits regulation, the Federal government cannot tidily insert itself as a policy-setter in a predominantly State-administered regulatory regime.' In establishing minimum Federal standards for health insurance, we may have to develop alternative approaches to the HIPAA framework so as to encourage States to meet Federal standards and retain enforcement responsibilities. 
Mr. President, the GAO report concludes that HCFA's regulatory role is likely to expand as it assumes enforcement responsibilities to ensure States' compliance with HIPAA. It is clear that HCFA's new regulatory responsibilities will increase the burden faced by health carriers and regulators, and will add to the confusion faced by consumers, who try to navigate through the intricate system of overlapping and duplicative regulatory jurisdiction.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has turned to consideration of the Community Opportunities, Accountability, Education and Training Services Act of 1998--the COATS Act--which reauthorizes the Human Services Act. This legislation, sponsored by Senator Coats, Senator Dodd, myself, and Senator Kennedy, was voted unanimously out of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 24, 1998, and continues to have broad bipartisan support. 
This bill includes the reauthorization of three of our most important programs providing services and assistance to the neediest of Americans: the Head Start program, the Community Services Block Grant, and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. It also includes a new program, the Assets for Independence Act, to empower these citizens into achieving economic independence. 
This legislation draws upon over thirty years of experience with these programs. While each of these programs is working--and working well--there are clearly some things that we can be doing better. So while this bill leaves present law largely intact, it does include some important changes to make these programs more accountable and more effective in carrying out the specific tasks that we have asked of them. 
The Head Start Program has been instrumental in helping many children enter school ready to learn. It goes beyond child care, by providing medical, dental, and other services to children enrolled in the program. However, I believe that its major contribution has been to support parents in their role as the primary teacher for their children. Head Start is a comprehensive service program that has made a difference in the lives of so many children and their parents. 
While most of us know the difference that Head Start has made in the lives of millions of children and their parents, it is important that we continue to ensure that the program is the very best it can be. This reauthorization includes a major evaluation and research initiative. I believe this research will help demonstrate the positive impact of high quality, comprehensive services for children and families. More importantly, this initiative can provide the American people with more information about how best to help prepare all of our children for the challenges that lie ahead in the next century. 
We also have increased funding for the Infant and Toddler Head Start program. Although this program is relatively new, the emerging research on early brain development clearly indicates that tremendous benefits can be gained by supporting parents in their efforts to be good parents for their children. Few young parents have the family and community support networks that were once such an integral part of raising children. The Infant and Toddler program strives to re-create those networks in order to help mothers and fathers better meet the challenges of parenthood. 
One of the more controversial changes in this year's reauthorization is the inclusion of for-profit providers as eligible grantees for Head Start. Yet, working with Senators Kennedy and Dodd, we were able to reach an acceptable compromise that makes clear exactly what is and is not allowed. Briefly, the legislation opens up the competitive process to another segment of child care and human service provider . However, it does not require the Secretary to award a grant to a non-profit entity. It does not lessen the requirements and standards that any Head Start program must meet. I do not believe that, by virtue of an organization's tax status, it is either more or less capable of providing the high quality of services which we require of all Head Start grantees. I am pleased that an agreement on this issue has been reached. 
The second major program authorized under this legislation is the Community Services Block Grant. This program provides funding which enables States to work with their communities to reduce poverty. That's an easily defined goal, but getting there takes lots of work. Because it is locally-driven and community-based, the CSBG is used differently in every community--drawing upon available strengths and resources to meet the unique needs of each. 
In Vermont, the CSBG serves communities all across our state, from Brattleboro to the Northeast Kingdom. Under the current formula, Vermont receives a little more than $2.6 million in CSBG funds. Whether it's using CSBG dollars to help the underprivileged learn new job skills or go back to school, or helping families become self-sufficient by teaching them how to search for affordable housing or simply work within a budget, I think countless families and communities in our State would agree that the initial investment has earned priceless returns. Communities are using those dollars to make a difference. 
For this reason, I am pleased that we have made only minor adjustments in these programs, and that most of these changes make some necessary improvements that will allow us to better determine the effectiveness of CSBG programs. For example, this bill requires states to monitor their grantees to determine whether they are meeting performance goals, administrative standards, and financial management requirements. The bill also establishes state and federal accountability and reporting provisions, and requires grantees to participate in a performance measurement system. Presently, grantees may participate in this system, but are not required to do so. The changes in this bill mean that we will be able to better monitor the progress of programs and measure the effectiveness of the delivery of programs. 
I want to point out, however, that I am aware that through a technical change that we were unable to remove at the last minute, this legislation contains language repealing the Community Economic Development program. This was brought to my attention, and to the attention of the Ranking Member, last Friday, and we have taken steps to remedy the situation. Our House colleagues have indicated their bill will not repeal this provision, and Senator Coats and I have pledged that we will remove the language repealing this program in conference. This is a matter that was due to a technical oversight only; it is certainly not the intention of the committee to end this program, and I am grateful for the assistance of Congressman Bill Goodling and his staff in helping us resolve this matter satisfactorily. 
I also want to mention that I know there was some concern about allowing faith-based organizations to participate as direct grantees in CSBG programs. I want to be clear that this bill does not allow faith-based organizations any priority in becoming grantees. It simply says that they may participate. If a faith-based organization receives a grant, it will still be expected to run quality programs and operate in the same way any other grantee would, including establishing a tri-partite board to administer the programs. Further, there is language in this bill essentially grandfathering in existing community action agencies as eligible grantees, so there should not be a concern that current grantees will suddenly find themselves jockeying for funding. If they are delivering good services, they may continue to do so. 
There was also some concern over including a new program, the Neighborhood Innovation Project, as an allowable activity under the discretionary account because it would mean less funds for the other programs authorized in the account. Let me explain why this is not the case--and, in fact, if Congressional appropriators follow the authorization carefully, there should be more funding for programs within this account. 
Under current law, the discretionary account receives a set-aside of nine percent of the CSBG funds. Presently, the discretionary account only contains the community economic development programs and the rural community development programs as allowable expenditures. However, at appropriations time, the appropriators have been folding the National Youth Sports program (NYSP) and the Community Food and Nutrition Act (CFNP) into the nine percent set-aside. What the law actually says--and what this bill reinforces--is that the NYSP and the CFNP program are both worthwhile programs that should receive separately appropriated line-items; they should not be competing with the community economic development and rural community development initiatives to receive a part of that nine-percent set-aside. I hope the appropriators will follow the authorization and limit the programs funded through the nine-percent set-aside. 
Under the new bill, we maintain the NYSP and CFNP as separate accounts that do not compete with programs in the discretionary account. I know this all sounds like maudlin bookkeeping, but what it means is that, even with the new Neighborhood Innovation Project included in the discretionary account, there are now only three programs among which the discretionary account can be divided, not four. That should mean funding can go a little bit further for these programs. Meanwhile, the NYSP and CNFP can receive their own separate streams of funding. That is clearly our intent. 
While on the subject of the NYSP, let me just mention one change we made in the current program to ensure a more comprehensive delivery of services. What this legislation would do is link youth who participate in this five week summer program to community-based youth services that can serve their needs all year long. 
The third major program reauthorized in this legislation is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which, due to the forward-funded nature of the program, is authorized through 2004. The program provides assistance to 4.3 million low-income households to help families pay their heating and cooling bills. LIHEAP is a state block grant program that has faced more than its fair share of budget cuts. In fact, I am very dismayed that appropriators on the House side have voted to slash funding for the program. 
Our bill reauthorizes the program at the $2 billion level and continues to authorize funds to be released on an emergency basis by the President. On that subject, we have included language that clarifies the criteria under which LIHEAP funds can be released during an emergency or natural disaster. Last winter, when much of Northern New England was devastated by a 100-year ice storm, 53 Senators unsuccessfully wrote to the President asking him to release LIHEAP emergency funds. Our bill includes language that will help states obtain funds when they face similar natural or economic disasters. 
Finally, this bill authorizes a new, $25 million program known as the Assets for Independence Act. This new program builds upon the Individual Development Accounts that we allowed under welfare reform. The Assets for Independence Act would help qualified, poor individuals establish individual savings accounts that they can later use for post-secondary education, purchase of a first home, or business capitalization. 
In Vermont, we are already operating a program very much like this under our welfare waiver. However, Vermont's program does not look exactly like what is in this bill, and I want to make it clear that Vermont, and any other state, may continue to operate existing IDA programs as they deem fit, using their existing resources. States do not have to make their program look like those established in this bill unless they specifically apply for the funding made available under this section. What is in this bill does not override any existing IDA program. Knowing this, I am pleased we were able to include this new section in the bill, as I know it has been a priority for Senator Coats, and I commend him for working with me to ensure that Vermont can continue to run its existing programs. 
This legislation is the result of months of hard work, negotiation, and compromise. This is a very good bill that deserves the support of the Senate. It reinforces what works in these programs, and discards what does not. It continues the mission that we began many years ago of empowering communities to help their most vulnerable populations, and it does this in a responsible manner. 
I am pleased with the bipartisan atmosphere that has surrounded this bill so far, and I look forward to finishing the reauthorization in the same manner. I want to thank Senator Coats for his excellent work on this important legislation. As always, it is a pleasure working with him, and I want to commend him for his hard work in crafting this compromise. Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd were instrumental in drafting this bill and moving it through the committee, and each has left a definite mark on this legislation. I also appreciate the valuable input from Senators DeWine and Ashcroft in drafting some key provisions of the bill. 
There are a number of staff who have worked very hard on this legislation who deserve recognition for their efforts. In particular, I want to thank Stephanie Monroe with Senator Coats--her effort was extraordinary; Suzanne Day, Jeanne Ireland and Jim Fenton with Senator Dodd; Stephanie Robinson with Senator Kennedy; and Geoff Brown, Kimberly Barnes-O'Connor and Brian Jones of my staff. In addition, I want to note the contributions of Vince Ventimiglia with Senator Coats on the IDA section; Aaron Grau with Senator DeWine for his help with migrant and seasonal Head Start; Robin Bowen with Senator McConnell for her assistance on the CED correction; and Denzel McGuire with Chairman Goodling for her help in assuring a smooth debate with the House. 
Again, Mr. President, I am proud of this legislation and of all the work that has gone into it. I look forward to working with our House colleagues to approve final legislation, with broad bipartisan support, before the 105th Congress adjourns for the year. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, July 25, 1998, is a great day for Vermont as we celebrate the sesquicentennial anniversary of the Blodgett Oven Company. On behalf of all Vermonters, I want to wish the company a very happy anniversary. 
For one hundred and fifty years, the Blodgett Oven Company has been a commercial cooking products manufacturer in Burlington, Vermont. Their products are renowned for their reliability and quality. Throughout the world, Blodgett ovens, broilers, steamers, and fryers are depended upon by the food service industry. Chefs know that they can trust the Blodgett name to deliver efficient, technologically advanced machinery. Within Chittenden County, the Blodgett Oven Company plays an important role, stimulating the local economy by providing hundreds of jobs to area residents. 
Mr. President, the Blodgett Oven Company is one of the most successful businesses in the state of Vermont. Their innovative products are well-known and, among their clientele, the company is regarded very highly. This tribute recognizes the achievements of the Blodgett Oven Company and, equally as important, the workers who contribute to the company's success.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to share some great news and to give thanks to the Members who helped me with respect to this very emotional situation that we have dealt with. I want to share the great news that three young Vermont girls who were abducted to Egypt are now back. I want to thank 56 of my colleagues for their support in this case for signing a letter to urge their return to Vermont. I also want to thank the Egyptian and American Governments for their invaluable assistance. 
Last October, anticipating a Vermont court order giving his wife sole custody of their three girls, Michael Zaazhoa took Sarah, Maryam and Leila under falsified passports and fled to Egypt. Lamis Zaazhoa began the frantic search for her girls, ages 3, 5 and 6, which took 9 months, and culminated in a joyful reunion at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo this past Friday. 
Lamis listened to the wise counsel of her family and decided to go the long, anxious route of petitioning the Egyptian courts for sole custody of her children under Egyptian law and getting an Egyptian court order for the return of her girls. The Vermont delegation quickly swung into action in support of her efforts, enlisting the help of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and the Egyptian Embassy in Washington. 
After the Egyptian courts ruled squarely in Lamis's favor, I walked around the Senate floor with a letter from Senator Leahy and me to President Mubarak of Egypt, asking for his support. Fifty-five of my Colleagues signed this letter. I am deeply appreciative of my Colleagues help, which I consider pivotal to the success of our efforts. And I am very grateful to the Egyptian Embassy and Egyptian Government for its help in ensuring that Egyptian law was enforced and the girls were returned to their mother. The staff of the American Embassy was there for us all along, and arranged the swift return to the United States of Lamis and her girls once they were reunited. 
I wish I could have invited all of my colleagues to the wonderful meeting Senator Leahy and I had with these three sweet girls yesterday! Their beautiful smiles and the joy on Lamis's face deeply touched the hearts of all those present. In difficult situations like these, we rely on the good offices of our Government, and the cooperation of our friends in foreign governments. And yesterday we saw with our own eyes the beautiful fruits of those efforts! 
This is an unusual result. Many of these cases occur, but very, very few are reconciled the way this was. I thank Jeff Munger of my staff in Vermont, whose sister brought to his attention the plight of the children and spearheaded the results that we got. So, again, I thank all the Members for their helpfulness in getting the three little girls back to Vermont. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Shelby and the entire Senate Transportation Appropriations Committee for their work putting together this legislation. I would like to briefly engage my colleagues in a colloquy on an issue important to me and my constituents in Vermont; preservation of our nation's historic covered bridges. The recently passed federal transportation legislation, ISTEA-2, contains language authorizing funding to protect historic wooden covered bridges. The National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Act asks the Secretary of Transportation to study the appropriate techniques to protect and preserve covered bridges, distribute this information to states and towns across the country and grant funds to fully repair and protect these beautiful old historic structures. The bill, that is now law, authorizes $10 million for these activities. I understand the difficulty my colleagues had in distributing funds in this legislation. Although no funds were directly appropriated for these activities, I would ask the Chairman of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee if he would agree that preservation of historic covered bridges should be a priority?

Would the Senator agree that the Federal Highway Administration should use available funds to develop and publish guidance for implementation of the National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Act?

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am glad to cosponsor the Pension Coverage and Portability Act of 1998, (PCPA). I cosponsored the predecessor bill, S. 889 with senators Graham, Hatch, and others, and PCPA is a natural follow-on to S. 889. 
This bill will encourage pension plan sponsorship among small businesses and make it easier for the small business man or woman to have greater confidence in government oversight of their plan and that they will not have to constantly hire services of actuaries, accountants and tax attorneys and investment advisers once they establish it. The bill makes it easier to implement a payroll deduction IRA, it provides for a simplified defined benefit pension plan, it allows a payroll deduction SIMPLE plan with limits twice as high as those currently available to IRAs, it eliminates IRS registration fees for new plans and provides a tax credit for plan start up, as well as many other things. 
The bill also eases the top-heavy rules. In the days when the only small pension plans belonged to doctor's and lawyer's offices, the top heavy rules were needed to assure non-discrimination in provision of benefits. But instead of expanding coverage, the top heavy rules now tend to impose harsh requirements on the small business owner which deters him or her from even offering a plan. This bill makes changes to the top heavy rules in constructive and thoughtful ways, such as by changing the family aggregation rules, taking employee elective contributions into account for purposes of meeting the standards and simplifying the definition of `key employee'. 
The bill makes pension plans more portable, a feature that is desperately needed in today's highly mobile workforce. Senator Graham has incorporated the body of S. 2329, the bill that he, Senator Bingaman and I introduced recently, as Title III of PCPA. Our bill eases rollovers, allows rollovers of after-tax contributions, waives the 60-day rule under certain circumstances, modifies the `same-desk' rule, rationalizes distribution rules and allows governmental workers to purchase service credit with defined contribution plan money to increase their benefits in their defined benefit plans. This bill makes essentially the same changes. 
In addition to encouraging plan sponsorship among small businesses and facilitating pension portability, the bill encourages retirement savings education. It also reduces the regulatory burdens associated with maintaining a plan, such as providing coverage test flexibility and freedom from the requirement to use mechanical nondiscrimination testing rules. 
Although I believe the vast majority of this measure takes positive steps forward, I do have some misgivings about the staffing firms provision included in section 108. I am cosponsoring PCPA despite the inclusion of section 108 in the bill, but I hope that Senator Graham and the other cosponsors will work with me to air the issues and try to address the concerns of those who oppose this provision in as constructive a manner as is appropriate.

Mr. JEFFORDS. This has been, to me, one of the more important days of this session. I believe that is true because of the introduction earlier by Senator Lott of the Republican health care bill. 
First, I commend the majority leader for the dexterous way in which he handled both allowing the members of a committee, a standing committee, to work, and then to join them with a leadership task force, formed by the majority leader, to put together a bill which could be backed by all Members of the Republican side. 
That was no easy task, but I am happy to say that by working together I think we have provided, for the Senate's review, an outstanding piece of legislation. I also want to begin by commending Senator Nickles and all the Members who participated in putting this legislation together on the task force, and in my committee. I think it is solid legislation that will result in a greatly improved health care system for Americans. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
As always, there has been a flurry of work over the past few weeks as we have put this legislation together. But this last-minute work is only possible because we laid a sound foundation throughout the entire 105th Congress through many hearings. 
In particular, there are members on my committee, who also served on the task force, who I think were key in bringing about a consensus. 
First, Senator Frist, who, obviously, from his valuable expertise as a physician, as well as a masterful legislator, has assisted in helping us provide a bill which we can be proud of and which we can be assured will be in the best interest of all patients as well as the health care system. 
Senator Collins, who came here after being a State regulator in the health care area, provided tremendous knowledge and insight into how we could weave in and out the very complicated aspects of what should the Federal Government do and what should the States do, with leaving an emphasis primarily on allowing the States--which I will talk about later. 
Over the past 14 months, the Labor and Human Resources Committee has held 11 hearings related to issues of health care quality, confidentiality, genetic discrimination, privacy, and HCFA's implementation of its new health insurance responsibilities. 
Senator Bill Frist's Public Health and Safety Subcommittee has also held three hearings on the work of AHCPR. That has to do with trying to ensure that we have adequate information about outcomes and to try to utilize that information to better equip our professional people to be the best in the world in health care. Each of these hearings helped us in developing the separate pieces of legislation that are reflected in the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
Other colleagues here and on the House side have worked on this subject for an extended period of time, as well. Many of the protections that are included in the Patients' Bill of Rights are similar to those fashioned by Senator Roth in the Finance Committee last year when we provided many of these same protections to plans that serve Medicare patients. 
As we prepared this legislation, we had three goals in mind: first, give families the protections they want and need; second, ensure that medical decisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients; and, finally, keep the cost of this legislation low so it does not displace anyone from being able to get health care coverage. 
As we all know, the number of people who participate is extremely sensitive to the cost of health care. Information about products or services is the keystone to any well-functioning market. The bill requires full information disclosure by an employer about the health plans that he or she offers employees. People need to know what the plan will cover and what their out-of-pocket expenses will be. And this should be in clear and obvious language which is readily available for the patient or the prospective purchaser of the insurance to review so they do not suddenly realize they have run out of money as far as the plan is concerned or they find that many aspects are not covered. 
They need to know where and how they will get their health care, and who will be providing these services. They also need to know how adverse decisions by the plan can be appealed, both internally and externally, to an independent reviewer. This is an extremely important part of this bill. This aspect of the bill which gives employees a brand new ERISA remedy of an external grievance and appeals process is one of which I am particularly proud since it is the cornerstone of S. 1712, my Health Care QUEST Act, which, incidentally, was a bipartisan bill. 
Under our bill, patients will get timely decisions about what will be covered. Further, if an individual disagrees with the plan's decision about coverage, that individual may ultimately appeal the decision to an independent, external reviewer after an internal review decision. And this can be done in an expedited situation, if it is necessary. 
The reviewer's decision will be binding on the part of the health plan, and the patients maintain their rights under ERISA to go to court. This is extremely important. This will be binding on the plan. So there will be no appeal by the plan through the courts or elsewhere from the decision by the reviewer. 
It is infinitely better to be able to get the care needed than to sue to recover damages because he or she could not get the care they needed, and the fact that that care was not being granted resulted in grievous situations for them. 
The medical records provision, which my committee also worked on for the past year, will give people the right to inspect and copy their personal medical information, and it will also allow them to append the record if there is inaccurate information. The bill will ensure that the holders of the information safeguard the medical records and requires them to share, in writing, their confidentiality policies and procedures with individuals. This is part of what was called the PIN Act, the Privacy Act, which also was a bipartisan bill. 
I want to again mention the task force. Senator Nickles started out some months ago desiring to provide the Republicans with a bill with which they could be pleased. A lot of work went into that. Many, many meetings were held. Many hours were spent trying to decide and make final decisions. I was a member of that task force, as was Senator Frist and Senator Collins from our committee. 
We had the ability to be able to utilize the expertise of the committee and the professional staff involved with them. I would like to mention Paul Harrington, in particular, and Karen Guice, of my staff, who is also a pediatrician and a fellow, for their incredibly good determinations on what the bill should have and their assistance in putting it together. 
I praise Senators Snowe and Domenici, who worked together to give us a portion of the bill which has to do with genetics 
and the protections that a patient should have, or an enrollee in a plan should have, to ensure that the genetic information--that genetic information--is not used against them to screen them. 
What I want to get to now, and I know there will be a lot more discussion next week, is the question of whether or not it is better to hand over much of the regulation to the Federal Government or whether it is better to leave it with the States. 
The 104th Congress enacted the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in 1996, fondly referred to as HIPAA. Many consider this legislation to be the most significant Federal health insurance reform of the past decade. During this Congress, I have tried to closely monitor the impact of HIPAA over the past year to ensure its successful implementation consistent with legislative intent. 
The Federal regulators at HCFA have faced an overwhelming new set of health insurance duties under HCFA. What we said was that if the States wanted to--and almost all of them did--they could take control and implement the provisions of HIPAA. But five decided not to--California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Missouri. 
So what happened is that enforcement was handed over to the Federal Government. That is the point I want to make as to what has happened because of that. The Department of Health and Human Resources is now required to act as the insurance regulator for the State HIPAA provisions. 
Based on the findings of the GAO report that will be released next week, HCFA is ill equipped to carry out the role of insurance regulator. Building a dual system of overlapping State and Federal health insurance regulation is in no one's best interest, and the principle that States should regulate private health insurance guided the design of our legislation to get out of the problems created by HIPAA. 
Our legislation creates new Federal managed care standards to cover those 48 million Americans covered by ERISA plans that the States cannot protect. That is the second point. There are areas that the State is preempted from by ERISA which was passed in 1976. Under ERISA, it stated that those plans for self-insured or those that are multistate situations are under Federal order to provide uniformity in the regulation. We feel it would be irresponsible to set health insurance standards that duplicate their responsibility to the 50 State insurance departments and have HCFA enforce them. 
In a July 16 House Ways and Means committee hearing, HCFA's administrator stated she intended to postpone, among other things, prospective payment systems for home health services. To Members who will note this, this is a real blow to many States, Vermont in particular, who are being damaged severely by the present situation with respect to the home health care services and payments. 
The balanced budget amendment of 1997 establishes a prospective payment system, or PPS, for home health care in fiscal year 2000. The payment system designed for the interim period is proving to be an intolerable burden for the home health agencies that service Vermont's Medicare beneficiaries. They have already written to urge HCFA to urge a PPS by the October 1999 deadline set by Congress, thus minimizing the time an interim payment system will be in place. Her statement that she has delayed will result in many home health providers not receiving the reimbursement that they deserve. Given HCFA's inability to carry out its current responsibilities, I believe it would be irresponsible to promise the American people that it will be able to guarantee other rights by regulating the private health insurance industry. 
I will not offer Americans a promise that experience tells us will be broken, a hope that I believe won't be met. Our proposal, by keeping the regulation of health insurance where it belongs--at the State level--provides the American people with a real Patients' Bill of Rights that they can have the confidence in knowing that they will be there when they need it. 
I am afraid that the political battle over this legislation will be the subject that dominates the headlines. But the real issue here is to give Americans the protections they want and need in the package that they can afford and that we can enact, and also that they will have a remedy which will allow them to expeditiously get the care they need by having outside professionals give them that opportunity. That is why I and others have been working on this legislation since the beginning of Congress and why I hope it will be adopted before the end of Congress and signed into law by the President. 
This is too important of an issue for us to get bogged down in partisanship. I know the Democrats, and many of them on my committee, too, have worked very hard on their own bills. But let us not try to find out whose bill is better. Let us join together and make sure we can put together in the final analysis, through the legislative process, a bill which we all can be proud of and which the American people will be pleased with.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, in January of this year I addressed the Senate along with my colleagues from New York and Maine about the awesome ice storm that struck our area. Thanks to the help of Chairman Bond and others, our region received much needed assistance and relief. Today, I rise to inform my colleagues that Vermont has experienced yet another series of natural disasters. During the past few weeks the state of Vermont has received tremendous amounts of rain, causing severe flooding throughout the state. In fact, eleven of our fourteen counties were declared disaster areas after several days of heavy rain flooded streams and rivers. 
Hardest hit was the pristine Mad River in central Vermont. The river's stream banks were overwhelmed. Heavy sediment washed down the river depleting water quality. However, in sections of the river where methods to protect the stream banks through bioengineering and vegetation planting were established, the banks held steady during the floods preventing soils and sediments from entering the water system. 
Assistance is needed in the Mad River Valley of Vermont. The quality of the water in the Mad River is of great importance to the communities in the valley. Because of the recent flooding there is a need for the Environmental Protection Agency to provide assistance for maintaining that water quality. I am aware of the devastation that occurs during a long period of heavy rain and understand the impact it can have on a river's health and appearance. Protecting the water quality is important. EPA should provide assistance to the Mad River Valley Union Municipal District to assist them in water quality improvements. Experimenting with new methods to protect our river banks will help find solutions to maintain water quality and the health of our rivers, as well as safeguard the property and lives that inhabit the river valleys. 
Madam President, with help from the EPA, more creative methods could be established and tested along the Mad River helping maintain water quality and the beauty of the river.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 2329, the Retirement Portability Account (RAP) Act. This bill is a close companion to H.R. 3503 introduced by our colleagues Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota and Jim Kolbe of Arizona earlier this year. In addition, it contains certain elements of H.R. 3788, the Portman-Cardin bill, which relate to increased pension portability. Generally this bill is intended to be a further iteration of the concepts embodied in both of those bills. It standardizes the rules in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) which regulate how portable a worker's retirement savings account is, and while it does not make portability of pension benefits perfect, it greatly improves the status quo. Consistent with `greatly improving the status quo', this bill contains no mandates. No employer will be `required' to accept rollovers from other plans. A rollover will occur when the employee offers, and the employer agrees to accept, a rollover from another plan. 
Under current law, it is not possible for an individual to move an accumulated retirement savings account from a section 401(k) (for-profit) plan to a section 457 (state and local government) deferred compensation plan, to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), then to a section 403(b) (non-profit organization) plan and ultimately back into a section 401(k) plan, without violating various restrictions on the movement of their money. The RAP Act will make it possible for workers to take their retirement savings with them when they change jobs regardless of the type of employer for which they work. 
This bill will also help make IRAs more portable and will improve the uses of conduit IRAs. Conduit IRAs are individual retirement accounts to which certain distributions from a qualified retirement plan or from another individual retirement account have been transferred. RAP changes the rules regulating these IRAs so that workers leaving the for-profit, non-profit or governmental field can use a conduit IRA as a parking spot for a pre-retirement distribution. These special accounts are needed by many workers until they have another employer-sponsored plan in which to rollover their savings. 
In many instances, this bill will allow an individual to rollover an IRA consisting exclusively of tax-deductible contributions into a retirement plan at his or her new place of employment, thus helping the individual consolidate retirement savings in a single account. Under certain circumstances, the RAP Act will also allow workers to rollover any after-tax contributions made at his or her previous workplace, into a new retirement plan. 
Current law requires a worker who changes jobs to face a deadline of 60 days within which to roll over any retirement savings benefits either into an Individual Retirement Account, or into the retirement plan of his or her new employer. Failure to meet the deadline can result in both income and excise taxes being imposed on the account. We believe that this deadline should be waived under certain circumstances and we have outlined them in the bill. Consistent with the Pomeroy-Kolbe bill, in case of a Presidentially-declared natural disaster or military service in a combat zone, the Treasury Department will have the authority to disallow imposition of any tax penalty for the account holder. Consistent with the additional change proposed by the Portman-Cardin bill, however, we have included a waiver of tax penalties in the case of undue hardship, such as a serious personal injury or illness and we have given the Department of the Treasury the authority to waive this deadline, as well. 
The Retirement Account Portability bill will also change two complicated rules which harm both plan sponsors and plan participants; one dealing with certain business sales (the so-called `same desk' rule) and the other dealing with retirement plan distribution options. Each of these rules has impeded true portability of pensions and we believe they ought to be changed. 
In addition, this bill will extend the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (PBGC) Missing Participant program to defined benefit multiemployer pension plans. Under current law, the PBGC has jurisdiction over both single-employer and multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. A few years ago, the agency initiated a program to locate missing participants from terminated, single-employer plans. The program attempts to locate individuals who are due a benefit, but who have not filed for benefits due to them, or who have attempted to find their former employer but failed to receive their benefits. This bill expands the missing participant program to multiemployer pension plans. 
I know of no reason why individuals covered by a multiemployer pension plans should not have the same protections as participants of single-employer pension plans and this change will help more former employees receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. This bill does not expand the missing participants program to defined contribution plans. Supervision of defined contribution plans is outside the statutory jurisdiction of the PBGC and I have not heard strong arguments for including those plans within the jurisdiction of the agency. 
In a particularly important provision, the Retirement Account Portability bill will allow public school teachers and other state and local employees who move between different states and localities to use their savings in their section 403(b) plan or section 457 deferred compensation arrangement to purchase `service credit' in the plan in which they are currently participating, and thus obtain greater pension benefits in the plan in which they conclude their career. However, the bill does not allow the use of a lump sum cash-out from a defined benefit plan to be rolled over to a section 403(b) or section 457 plan. 
As a final note, this bill, this bill does not reduce the vesting schedule from the current five year cliff vesting (or seven year graded) to a three year cliff or six year graded vesting schedule. I am not necessarily against the shorter vesting schedules, but I feel that this abbreviated vesting schedule makes a dramatic change to tax law without removing some of the disincentives to maintaining a pension plan that businesses--especially small businesses--desperately need.

Furthermore, if an individual disagrees with the plan's decision, that individual may ultimately appeal the decision to an independent external reviewer. The reviewer's decision will be binding on the part of the health plan. But, the patient maintains his or her current rights under ERISA to go to court. 
The medical records provisions, which my committee has also worked on for the past year and are contained in S.1921, the Health Care PIN Act, which I introduced with Senator Dodd, will give people the right to inspect and copy their personal medical information and it will allow them to amend the record if there is inaccurate information. The bill will ensure that the holders of the information safeguard the medical records. It requires them to share, in writing, their confidentiality policies and procedures with individuals. 
The 104th Congress enacted the Kassebaum/Kennedy legislation, also known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Many consider this legislation to be the most significant federal health insurance reform of the past decade. During this Congress, I have tried to closely monitor the impact of HIPAA over the past year to ensure its successful implementation and consistency with legislative intent. 
The federal regulators at HCFA have faced an overwhelming new set of health insurance duties under HIPAA. In the five states that have failed to or chosen not to pass the legislation required by HIPAA (California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Missouri), the Department of Health and Human Services is now required to act as insurance regulator for the state HIPAA provisions. 
Based on the findings of a GAO report that I will be releasing next week, our experience under HIPAA demonstrates that HCFA is ill equipped to carry out the role of insurance regulator. Building a dual system of overlapping state and federal health insurance regulation is in no one's best interest. The principle that the states should continue to regulate the private health insurance market guided the design of our `Patients' Bill of Rights' legislation. 
Our legislation creates new federal managed care standards to cover those 48 million Americans covered by ERISA plans that the states cannot protect. We feel that it would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards that duplicate the responsibility of the 50 state insurance departments and have HCFA enforce them. 
A recent example demonstrates why this is such a concern. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 establishes a prospective payment system (PPS) for home health care in fiscal year 2000. The payment system designed for the interim period is proving to be an intolerable burden for the home health agencies that serve Vermont's Medicare beneficiaries. At a July 16th House Ways and Means hearing, HCFA's administrator stated that she intended to postpone the development of a Medicare prospective payment systems for home health services. Her statement that she is delaying this mandate will result in many home health providers not receiving the reimbursement that they deserve and puts many of those providers at risk. 
Given HCFA's inability to carry out its current responsibilities, I believe it would be irresponsible to promise the American people that they will be able to receive new federal guarantees in the private health insurance system if we are relying on HCFA to enforce these rights. 
Our proposal, by keeping the regulation of health insurance where it belongs--at the state level--provides the American people with a real Patients' Bill of Rights that they can have the confidence in knowing will be enforced. 
I am afraid that the political battle over this legislation will be the subject that dominates the headlines. But the real issue here is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a package that they can afford and that we can enact. That is why I and others here have been working on this legislation since the beginning of this Congress, and why I hope the `Patients' Bill of Rights' we have introduced today will be adopted before the end of the Congress and signed into law by the President.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to once again express my concern over the plight of Medicare beneficiaries who are in need of home health care services. I am pleased to cosponsor the Home Health Access Preservation Act of 1998, with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, as an attempt to address these concerns. The Interim Payment System which was enacted by this Congress for the reimbursement of home health care services is not achieving the policy goals that Congress wants nor is it not serving the best interest of American citizens. 
The act is appropriately titled because, without a correction, access to home health services for Medicare's most vulnerable beneficiaries will be seriously damaged. Since the new reimbursement system has been implemented, no fewer than 1,200 agencies have left Medicare program and most of these 1,200 have been forced to cease operations. Although many of our health policy actions are based upon allowing the market to determine the optimum efficiency of our health care system, we must recognize that not all areas and all sectors are prepared for a rapid change in how these forces operate. The problem of access to home care is particularly troublesome in rural areas and inner cities where these services are sorely needed. 
My home State of Vermont is a case in point. Home health agencies and their patients are facing a true crisis. There are only 13 agencies in the State, all not-for-profit, each serving a distinct and separate area. The system was developed to meet the needs of our largely rural State, and all of these agencies have a long tradition of providing quality care to our citizens. We cannot accept the loss of a single agency without serious consequences for patients and other sectors of care. 
I want to emphasize that today we are proposing a revision to the home health reimbursement system because of our deep concern for the welfare of those frail elders and disabled individuals who have come to depend upon home care for their very existence. Yes, we are concerned about fiscal responsibility. We remain determined to eliminate fraud and abuse within the Medicare program. Of course, we must find a way to preserve the Medicare Trust Fund for future generations. But it is not acceptable to seek these goals by any mechanism that will impose an even greater burden on those who are most in need of our help. 
The Home Health Access Preservation Act of 1998 is budget neutral. It does not change the fact that home health agencies will have to work hard to remain financially viable and allocate their resources carefully. The Act does, however, level the playing field for home health agencies. Under the present IPS system, agencies in close proximity to one another are expected to operate competitively under highly divergent payment limits. Furthermore, under the current IPS system, the most efficient agencies and those that care for the most difficult cases, are hit hardest by the reduction in reimbursement. Thus the Act does provide some relief for agencies in the worst predicament. 
Finally, it is important to recognize that the Home Health Access Preservation Act represents an interim resolution to our most pressing concerns. The implementation of a prospective payment system as directed by Congress represents the preferred solution. Thus, the bill requires the Secretary to provide regular quarterly updates to Congress on progress toward the development of the prospective payment system for home health care. But for now, Congress must pass legislation to ensure that home care remains an option for Medicare beneficiaries. We also must pledge to work with the Health Care Financing Administration and the home health industry to replace the interim payment system with a permanent system which better meets the needs of patients and is fair to health care providers. 
This Congress struggles with many challenges, but I doubt that there are many that are of greater significance than home health care. Access to home care affects a significant number of persons, has a serious influence on their mental and physical health, and its financial impact is measured in billions of dollars. We must act. We must act quickly to curtail the negative consequences of the payment system as it exists today.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to join Senator Leahy in expressing my hope that we can revisit the issue of disaster assistance funding in conference. Senator Leahy and I toured the damage in Vermont following the flooding there earlier this month, and the damage for farmers in affected areas was indeed severe. Those farmers are going to need assistance and I hope that we will be able to provide it in this bill.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, 1998 is an important year for Vermont and the nation as it marks the 100th anniversary of the death of a great statesman, Senator Justin S. Morrill. Senator Morrill was a remarkable man; his authorship of the Land-Grant College Act gave, and continues to give, millions of Americans the opportunity to pursue higher education. To recognize this accomplishment, the Stratford Historical Society is holding a symposium on July 16 and 17, 1998 to pay homage to Senator Morrill and his legacy. 
Senator Morrill was one the most influential politicians in the mid-nineteenth century. During his 43 years in Congress, he introduced many innovative bills and worked to improve the lives of millions of Americans through higher education. The Land-Grant College Act provided public lands for agricultural colleges and, in turn, set the standard for American public universities. In addition to these accomplishments, Senator Morrill was also instrumental in the creation of the Washington Monument and the Library of Congress. 
In fact, on November 4, 1997, I was honored to attend a ceremony at the Library of Congress to unveil a plaque in the Great Hall of the Jefferson Building honoring Senator Morrill. The plaque was presented to the Library on behalf of the people of Vermont by the Vermont Center for the Book, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Jefferson Building. The plaque honors the vital role that Senator Morrill played in making the Jefferson Building a reality. 
Mr. President, Justin S. Morrill was a dedicated statesman who spent his life helping others. He revolutionized education and, as poet Robert Frost once noted, `For me there is no greater name in American education than that of Senator Justin Smith Morrill.' Such an amazing man deserves recognition and, on this 100th anniversary of his death, I pay tribute to him and his accomplishments.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate is considering S. 1882, the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. This legislation extends for 5 years the authorization of programs under the Higher Education Act and makes significant improvements in student benefits and in the operation of these programs. 
The Higher Education Act is among the most significant statutes under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Since its inception in 1965, the Act has been focused on enhancing the opportunities of students to pursue postsecondary education. This legislation will make college more accessible for more Americans by increasing the amount of Pell grants and lowering interest rates for student loans. By increasing the access and quality of higher education, this bill will help ensure that our nation remains a leader in educational excellence for all of our citizens. By giving more students the ability to attend college, we are giving them the opportunity to pursue their dreams. 
136 years ago this week, Senator Justin Smith Morrill from Vermont led the effort in the United States Senate to pass the Land Grant College Act of 1862, which opened the doors of higher education to all Americans. Today, I am proud to follow in Justin Smith Morrill's footsteps and urge the Senate to pass this important bipartisan legislation which will make the dream of getting a college education become a reality for millions of students across this nation. 
Over the years, the federal effort in this area has been substantial and will continue to be so. The Higher Education Act currently provides $48.5 billion in student financial assistance for 8.5 million students and $216 million for institutional development. In 1995-96, 55 percent of undergraduate students received financial aid under this Act. Over the next ten years, the Federal Government will guarantee over 88 million student loans--totaling over $383.5 billion. Over the next five years, the Federal Government will provide more than 25.4 million Pell Grants. 
The reauthorization bill we are considering today preserves the focus on students--who are the primary reason we have a Higher Education Act in the first place. Students now in school will be assured of receiving the lowest interest rate in nearly two decades on their loans. Students now in high school who aspire to a college education will benefit from an expanded early intervention program known as CONNECTIONS, as well as continuing to receive services from the time-tested and highly regarded TRIO programs. 
Students who have graduated and are faced with exceptionally high loan burdens will be able to take advantage of extended repayment options under the guaranteed loan program. Recognizing the toll which ever increasing college costs are placing on students, the bill builds on recommendations of the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education so that students and their families can obtain useful cost information. 
This bill reflects a strong commitment to the maintenance of two viable loan programs--the guaranteed or Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and the Direct Loan Program. Among the most challenging tasks facing the committee was developing a student loan interest rate which could offer the lowest viable interest to students while assuring sufficient lender participation to preserve full access to loans. After nearly a year of consultation with students, lenders, representatives of the higher education community, the administration and financial services experts, the committee developed a compromise interest rate package. Lender yield is reduced by 30 basis points while students receive the significant interest rate reduction they have anticipated. This solution is by no means perfect, but it promises to preserve the stability of the FFEL program for the nearly 4 million students and their families who depend upon these loans each year. 
The legislation also includes a new guaranty agency financing model--the goal of which is to achieve cost savings and efficiencies in the delivery and administration of student aid while ensuring that students, lenders, the Federal Government, and institutions of higher education receive high quality service. Additional efforts to improve the delivery of student aid programs include the development of a Performance Based Organization (PBO) to strengthen the management of key systems within the Department of Education. A number of provisions in the legislation also pave the way toward taking advantage of the efficiencies made possible through electronic processing and other technological advances. 
Looking toward the future, the bill contains several provisions dealing with the Year 2000 computer problem. The Office of Management and Budget has raised serious questions about the Department of Education's ability to meet the timetable outlined by the General Accounting Office for the testing of software renovation work. Failure to renovate all mission critical systems could result in disruptions in the management and delivery of student financial aid to more than 8 million students. This is an area in which the committee will be following closely in the months ahead. 
Perhaps the most exciting and far-reaching innovation in this legislation is its provisions dealing with teacher preparation. The bill before us eliminates some 15 small, categorical teacher training programs--only one of which receives funding--and replaces them with a comprehensive model for change and improvement. The teacher quality provisions included in Title II of S. 1882 are an important first step towards really improving teacher training. I think it will be viewed as one of the lasting achievements of this reauthorization. 
It represents a collaboration of good ideas from many members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, each who spent a great deal of time on this matter. The result is a proposal that breaks away from `business-as-usual' practices, and encourages States and education partnerships to reform their efforts to meet the needs of students in today's classroom. 
At its foundation, Title II embraces the notion that investing in the preparation of our nation's teachers is a good one. Well prepared teachers play a key role in making it possible for our students to achieve the standards required to assure both their own well being and the ability of our country to compete internationally. In fact, the continued health and strength of our nation depends on our country's ability to improve the education of our young people. Integral to that is the strength and ability of our nation's teaching force. Without a strong, competent, well prepared teaching force, other investments in education will be of little value. 
The bill takes a two-pronged approach to helping assure that our nation's elementary and secondary school teachers will be thoroughly prepared to offer the quality of instruction needed to assure that students achieve the standards we need and expect. Working at both the state level to promote system-wide reforms and at the local level to develop partnerships to enhance the quality of teacher training, the bill offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to this pressing national need. 
Title II demands excellence from our teacher preparation programs; encourages coordination; focuses on the need for academic content knowledge and strong teaching skills; and fosters state innovations in establishing more rigorous standards and exploring alternative certification. These efforts recognize the fundamental connection that exists among states, institutions of higher education, and efforts to improve education for our nation's elementary and secondary school teachers. 
The teacher training provisions included in this bill are unique in other ways as well. In particular, the committee included very strong accountability measures as part of this title. In order to maintain a grant, a State or a partnership will have to show improvement--measurable results--that go to the heart of learning. 
It is important to consider the Title II provisions in the context of education reform because, as I have said before, good teachers are at the core of educational improvement. 
It has been 15 years since the national crisis in education was raised by the `A Nation At Risk' report. The admonition was given in these terse words: If a foreign government had imposed on us our educational system we would have declared it an act of war. 
Yet little has changed. There is some improvement in science but little in math. Children are coming to school slightly more prepared to learn, but this is primarily in the area of health. 
It is obvious that nothing is going to change unless it changes in the classroom. And nothing will change in the classroom until the teachers change. And the teachers can't be expected to change until they have help in knowing what is expected of them. 
In the most recent Goals 2000 Report issued last November, we learned that in more than 40 States there was no change in the percentage of teachers who reported that they held a degree or held a teaching certificate in their main teaching assignment. In 33 States no change was reported in the proportion of beginning public school teachers who participated in a formal teacher induction process. 
Dindo Rivera, who travels about the county for IBM raising this issue, likes to explain it this way: If you were an office worker and had fallen asleep as Rip Van Winkle did for twenty years and walked into a modern office you would go into catatonic shock at trying to do anything from answering the phone to typing a letter. However, if you were a school teacher when you walked back into the classroom after your slumber, you'd feel right at home in your subjects. 
Some changes are occurring. The concept of `social promotion' initiated in the 60's is being challenged but creating serious problems for schools requiring remedial help. Literacy programs are being initiated to stop or reduce the inflow of non readers. But as to the crisis of math and science and other critical subjects, we have seen little in the way of results. 
Pointing a finger at the colleges of education is not inappropriate. They need to change. They must ensure that graduates are capable of facing today's challenge--not yesteryears. But they are unlikely to change unless the universities that host them pay attention to them. Often times, the schools of education are treated as step children. In most cases the degrees issued are not enough to increase their capacity to teach updated courses--and these updated courses are sorely needed. 
We must focus attention on this issue. We should fully fund the new Title II Teacher Quality Program that is included in this bill. We should also call together the presidents of the universities to challenge them to take immediate action to remedy the crisis. We must enlist the teachers and the teachers unions and insist that they too help out. 
The Higher Education bill before us does make strides in the direction of reform and improvement. Still, we must do even more to raise awareness of the problem and the need to change. The number of teachers is not as important as the quality of teachers. On the Federal level we must focus on promoting and ensuring quality. We don't necessarily need millions of new teachers--what we really need are millions of good teachers. 
The need for good teachers has been recognized. The Hunt Commission Report, `What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future' has a goal of providing 100,000 nationally accredited teachers. But their goal is too far off into the next century. Their goal would provide one teacher for every school. We need one for every classroom and, most certainly every new teacher graduating must be trained to be a good teacher. Every teacher's college must meet that challenge and every present teacher must be given the training to be a good teacher. The present bill takes a giant step in that direction. 
In closing, I would like to acknowledge the long hours and hard work of members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee and their staffs over the past 18 months as we have worked to develop this legislation. Even with the substantial streamlining we have done in the Act, a thorough review of all its provisions is a large and challenging task. At this time, I would like to offer particular thanks to the ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, to Senator Coats, and to Senator Dodd. These three members have gone well beyond the extra mile in helping to forge a bipartisan approach to improving the lives of American students. Throughout committee deliberations, there have been legitimate differences of opinion. The spirit of cooperation and the commitment to working through these differences has allowed us to present to the Senate a solid piece of legislation which I believe every member of this body can proudly support. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

I understand the special circumstances involved in the State of California makes it different than the other 49 States in this regard, but the amendment has been carefully crafted so that it is acceptable to this side of the aisle. 
We believe they should have the opportunity to provide Pell Grant assistance in the fifth year, which is generally seen, perhaps, now, as a necessary aspect of getting the teachers fully qualified for many of the areas they teach. 
I have no objections on this side of the aisle to the amendment. It is accepted as far as the majority is concerned.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Specter. I believe it is an excellent amendment. 
First of all, I commend Senator Specter for the tremendous work he has done in the field of education. 
And as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that handles education as well as many other very difficult subjects, he has done an extremely capable job of ensuring a good balance in all of the programs he handles. I commend him and I am pleased to have him back with us in the Senate. He was unable to be here at this particular time, so I am offering this amendment on his behalf. 
Mr. President, since the last reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, crime on our college and university campuses has continued to be a major concern. In a 1997 report on campus crime, the National Center for Education Statistics noted the following: 
During each of the 3 years between 1992 and 1994, institutions reported a total of about 10,000 violent crimes and up to 40,000 property crimes. For 1994, the individual crime composition for violent crimes was about 20 murders, about 1,300 forcible sex offenses, 3,100 robberies, and 5,100 cases of aggravated assault. In the property crime category, institutions reported 28,800 burglaries and 9,000 motor vehicle thefts in 1994. In 1994, institutions reported about 20,400 arrests for liquor law violations, and about 7,200 arrests for drug abuse violations, and about 2,000 arrests for weapons possession. 
From 1995 to 1996, for example, reports of murder, sexual offenses, and liquor- and drug-related violations for large universities increased substantially. It is not necessarily the case that crimes have gotten worse but perhaps that reporting has gotten better. Reports of crimes have continued to grow, but some institutions have still been less than diligent in accurately reporting campus crime statistics. 
Every Member should be greatly concerned by these campus crime statistics. I am pleased that the Senate Labor Committee has made what I think are great strides in improving campus crime provisions in the 1998 Higher Education Act amendments. We have added to the list of crimes to be reported. We have enabled information about students' criminal records to become publicly accessible. We have required institutions of higher learning to maintain daily logs of crimes on campuses. With the help of Senator Torricelli, we have strengthened the reporting of hate crimes on campuses. 
With the assistance of Senators Gregg and Wellstone, we created a competitive grant program to help institutions of higher education develop and strengthen the effective security and investigation strategies to combat violent crimes against women on campuses. 
The amendment being offered by Senator Specter today provides an absolutely essential addition to the campus crime provisions in the Higher Education Act. His leadership on this issue is much appreciated. With his meticulous crafting, he has substantially improved the definition of `campus' for the purpose of reporting campus crime statistics. When Senator Specter held his campus crime hearing, he discovered that if a crime was committed on a sidewalk within the perimeters of a university, that institution was not required to report the incident in their campus crime statistics. Obviously, the law needed clarification, and I applaud Senator Specter in his superb efforts. His efforts create a careful balance. 
This amendment minimizes additional reporting burdens to institutions of higher education while at the same time providing students and other members of campus communities with needed information to help improve their awareness about campus security issues. Such information, for example, can be used to help people make more conscious decisions about walking alone in particular areas or making sure to walk with a friend on or near a campus at night. 
This amendment makes four changes in the statute. As I mentioned, it modifies the definition of `campus' to include additional areas that must be included in campus crime statistics. It requires the Secretary of Education to report to Congress when institutions of higher education are not in compliance with campus crime reporting requirements. It gives the Department of Education the explicit authority to impose fines if institutions substantially misrepresent information about campus crimes. And it renames the campus crime section of the bill after Jeanne Clery, the woman who died tragically at Lehigh University in 1986 as a result of a brutal campus crime. The Clery family has been instrumental in creating a national awareness and focus on campus crime over the past decade. Both Senator Specter and I are indebted to their service in helping Congress craft these provisions. 
Mr. President, it is my pleasure to offer this on behalf of Senator Specter. I ask for its adoption.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will make the remarks in support of Senator Graham's amendment, and I support him. 
I believe that this takes care of really an important problem which some of our service people have had. Thus, I do not object to it. I did have a problem with the way the offset was chosen originally, which would have put the bill out of balance with the Congressional Budget Office and, therefore, we worked with the Senator from Florida to find a more acceptable way. 
I sympathize with the comments of Senator Kennedy in taking it from the discretionary fund of the Secretary. But it is better to do it this way and not put the bill out of balance, and to spread it over a number of years so that it is not a big hit. 
I commend him for bringing this to our attention. I thank him for allowing us to include in the managers' package language that ensures that in the aggregate, all types of Federal aid for education will not exceed the cost of the required levels. The inclusion of this provision expresses the concerns I had, and, therefore, I support it.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. It is our intention to finish tonight and to have the vote on final passage tomorrow morning at 9:30. 
I just urge everybody to take Senator Sessions' example by getting a time limit and disposing of the amendments. I think this side is nearing completion. I don't believe we have any controversial amendments that will take a great deal of time. So I am really expecting that we can finish tonight, with the cooperation of all Members. Certainly, I look forward to Senator Byrd's comments.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, clearly, that is the intent. We do not intend to exclude the preparation of teachers for teaching at the elementary and secondary level and we agree that good instruction in how to teach reading and elementary mathematics should be a major emphasis because giving students a strong foundation in reading and math in the early years is critical to giving them a solid foundation for learning throughout their entire lives.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator, and I appreciate your support for higher education in Texas and your interest in this particular issue. I certainly understand your concern and your desire to ensure that all state secondary markets are treated equitably and that they are able to fully participate in the FFEL Program. I, too, want to see this important program and all its participants succeed so that students continue to have adequate access to affordable loans for their post-secondary education goals. 
While this specific issue is one that we have not yet held hearings on in the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I am interested in doing so in order to thoroughly review the merits of granting eligible lender status to all state secondary markets. As this process continues, I will certainly seek the input and suggestions of you as well as Senator Hutchison.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to say to the Senator from Michigan that I am tremendously impressed with the dedication, determination, and work ethic of our Olympic hopefuls. Given the opportunity, the same ethic suggests that they would apply similar dedication to academic endeavors. Balancing a schedule of rigorous training and education is very difficult for any person. Our Olympic athletes should be in the position to acquire post-secondary education after representing our country in the Olympic games. For these reasons, I pledge to the Senator from Michigan my efforts in the conference to consider the House language which reauthorizes the Olympic Education Scholarship.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I reluctantly rise in opposition to this amendment. I do so reluctantly because the Senator from New Mexico and certainly the Senator from Mississippi have been very active in trying to accomplish the goals which are intended by this amendment. The bill itself already, with the assistance of the Senator from New Mexico--in many cases his own language--has provided incentives and has carefully outlined programs to reward the States for accomplishing the role of making sure that the teachers, the new teachers, have a major in the area that they intend to teach. 
So I applaud him for those, but I just think it goes too far, and I think it is counterproductive if you order the States to do something, which I agree they should do, but I think it will be counterproductive for the purposes of getting States to understand why they should and to do it not because they are told to but because they want to. On the `want to' side, also, States are rewarded when they do so by grants and funding, and those that do not will not be eligible for some of the funds that would be eligible to those that do. So there are incentives built in already to accomplish the goal. 
This provision just goes too far and will result not in improving teacher preparation programs but will instead provide little or no incentive for States to reform teacher preparation or for schools of arts and sciences to work with their schools of education. Mandating at the Federal level that States or partnerships require academic majors for prospective teachers in order to be eligible for title II funds is counterproductive to the goals of that title. 
Title II requires that schools of arts and sciences work with schools of education to improve and expand the academic rigor of these programs. By excluding these States and partnerships from competing for title II money, we are discouraging change in the very States and schools that need it the most. 
About 20 States do not currently require students to have majors in academic content areas, and 30 do. So we should not exclude those that are not presently doing it from getting funds to help them do it. In other words, those of us who oppose it believe that the carrot is much more effective in this area than the stick. Title II will demand much of these grantees that receive the funds. Grantees will be required to show that they have increased the number of courses taught by teachers with academic majors in a particular field of study or they will lose their grants. 
It is important to note that the amendment would deny States or institutions other Federal funds provided under this act, excluding title IV assistance. 
This, too, is of concern to me. Requiring a major is not an issue that the Federal Government should be mandating. It is an issue that has historically been decided by States and institutions of higher learning. And while we encourage it in title II, it is not appropriate for the Federal Government to mandate it, as a prerequisite for participation in the title II grant program. 
Finally, many States are moving towards requiring majors and increasing the academic content knowledge of prospective teachers. It does not seem at all sensible to deny funds to the folks who are now moving in the right direction. 
This is a very, very critical area, and this is an important amendment, and it should be carefully reviewed. It has some support, but I believe the bill is well balanced as it presently is written, that this amendment will be counterproductive of the goals of the bill, and therefore I must reluctantly oppose the amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment put forward by my colleague, Senator Harkin. I think what is really intended here is an effort to try to undermine the effectiveness of the FFEL Program. I know my good friend from Iowa is a fan of direct lending. I know the same is true of my colleague from Massachusetts. And any way that they can try to undermine the FFEL Program and increase the capacity of the direct loans to somehow supplant it, is an effort which I can understand. 
I have been involved in this a long time. I was involved in creating the commission that ended up recommending direct lending. We have tried very hard to make sure these programs operate on a basis of fairness and comparability. So far, that has worked well. 
This bill provides nearly $1 billion each year in new benefits. Many of these benefits were paid for by offsets found within the guaranteed student loan program. 
Pell grants--S. 1882 raises the maximum Pell grant to historically high levels and authorizes $85.6 billion in Pell grants over the next 5 years. 
Other student assistance--S. 1882 authorizes more than $15 billion over the next 5 years for work-study grants, TRIO Programs, SEOG, childcare grants for low-income students and other important programs. 
Loan forgiveness for child care providers--S. 1882 authorizes more than $50 million over the next 5 years to provide loan forgiveness to low-income individuals who pursue careers as child care providers. 
Loan forgiveness for teachers--S. 1882 authorizes more than $615 million over the next 10 years to provide loan forgiveness to teachers who pursue teaching careers in private or public secondary or elementary schools that serve low-income families. 
Extended repayment options--S. 1882 permits, at a cost of $290 million over 5 years, borrowers in the FFEL program with debt levels equal to or greater than $30,000 to be offered extended and graduated repayment terms similar to those available in direct lending. 
Student loan interest rate--And finally, and without doubt the most important benefit we are offering to students, is the low interest rate. S. 1882 preserves two vital and healthy loan programs while providing students with the lowest interest rates they have enjoyed in nearly 20 years. By some estimates, this interest rate will provide students with a new benefit (in reduced interest costs) of nearly $11 billion. 
These examples speak for themselves and they reflect the strong commitment I share with my colleagues to encouraging greater participation in higher education. The debate in which we are now engaged does not reflect upon one's commitment to student benefits. S. 1882 already provides nearly $1 billion in new student benefits each year. The issue which we must now confront is whether we are truly committed to preserving the stability of two student loan programs. The Harkin amendment, I believe unintentionally, would destroy the hub of the FFEL program by putting more than twenty-two guaranty agencies, including the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, out of business--out of business. 
I want to reiterate this point. In order to provide some students with a maximum of a $42 per year benefit, this amendment undermines the guaranty agency financing model and threatens the continued viability of the FFEL program both now and in the future. The choice is quite clear--a vote for the amendment offered by Senator Harkin is a vote to destabilize the FFEL program. A vote against the amendment offered by Senator Harkin is a vote to preserve the many benefits that the FFEL program so successfully offers to students and their families. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
I point out that the $172 that was mentioned is over 4 years. It doesn't sound quite as much when you talk about 4 years as it does in 1 year. That is a few six-packs of beer a year. It is significant, perhaps a single text book, but certainly not something that is going to make a huge difference to any student. 
I point out, this Federal fund and the insurance premium were created to try to take care of student loan defaults, to take care of the times when student's default on their loans, or loans are discharged due to death or disability. 
Mr. President, 43 percent of the total cost of the FFEL Program are student loan defaults. This insurance premium helps take care of those defaults. 
I would like to address for a moment the student and family benefits that are provided in this bill. S. 1882 reflects a strong bipartisan--in fact, unanimous commitment of members of the Senate Labor Committee--to craft a bill which strengthens and expands the access to higher education. 
We have built up a dual system of competition perhaps. But we have two student loan systems that are more in balance now, and this bill balances those two systems again. This amendment would attempt to unbalance it, to again favor the direct lending program by taking a benefit away from one program and giving it to the other, and along the way, perhaps putting many of the present guaranty agencies that provide assistance to our college students out of business. 
So I urge Senators to take a look at what this amendment really does. The minimal gain, $42 a year, which might possibly occur, is no balance to the risk of putting this whole program into a position where it could fail, at a cost of billions to students and the Federal Government.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe we are reaching conclusion on this amendment. It is my intention to make a few comments and then I believe Senator Harkin will close in a few minutes. 
In the interim, let me first make a very few comments. We are comparing apples and oranges here and you can make the apples look bad if you want to because you can't compare the oranges. 
The `oranges' are the direct lending program. It is a great one to cover things up. What you do when you lend out the money is create an accounts receivable on your ledger sheet. It doesn't show up anywhere regarding who doesn't pay back; it just shows up who does pay back. So it is very hard to trace where the losses are. On the other hand, the private sector one is a balanced one, with the student paying a 1 percent insurance fee which helps take care of default. The lenders absorb 2 percent of the cost of defaults, which helps, and the guaranty agencies absorb 5 percent, and the Federal government absorbs the remainder, which balances out and provides the money to pay for the default. So you can't really compare the two programs. You can make this one look bad because you don't know what the other program has done. There is no way of telling. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator Harkin, the Harkin amendment be set aside, that Senator Kennedy be recognized to offer his amendment, that there be 30 minutes equally divided on the Kennedy amendment, and that no second-degree amendments be in order. I further ask that upon the conclusion of debate on the Kennedy amendment, votes occur first on the Kennedy amendment, and then on the Bingaman amendment, and finally on the Harkin amendment, and that there be no second-degree amendments to any of the amendments.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment being offered by my colleague Senator Kennedy. While I share his interest in exploring mechanisms for improving the delivery of student loans, as chairman of the Labor Committee, I strongly oppose his effort to provide the Department of Education--whose desire to disadvantage the FFEL program has been aptly demonstrated--with unbridled authority to conduct an experiment on the FFEL program. 
The impetus for this concept arose out of the lengthy deliberations we have had over the past eighteen months about setting the appropriate interest rate for students and lenders. In 1993, when the Student Loan Reform Act was being drafted, its authors--including Senator Kennedy--anticipated that the Federal government would shift entirely from the FFEL program to the Federal Direct Loan program. A transition provision was included in the law which changed the way that student loan interest rates were to be calculated effective July 1, 1998. This change was primarily intended to reflect the budget scoring needs of the Direct Lending program. The consequences for student borrowers in the FFEL program, however, would have been dramatic. 
There is general agreement that, if the interest rate that was set for July 1, 1998 and which was delayed until October 1, 1998 is allowed to go into effect, it will become unattractive for lenders to participate in the FFEL program.

We say here is an idea; study it, and then make recommendations, and then we can maybe go to a pilot if it looks good. You don't give it to an agency who is dedicated to doing the program in unless you obviously want to kill the program. And that is obviously the design here.

The problem with this amendment is that it mandates to the States that they must do something. The bill itself provides incentives for them to make sure that the people wanting to be teachers have studied the things which they will teach. We do it by enticement and through assistance with loan programs--with programs--whereas this amendment would order it done. 
It is a mandate, and I think it is inappropriate and that it would be counterproductive.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Harkin amendment. It sounds nice but it really doesn't do what was anticipated. It saves maybe $42 a year for the students; that is, if the program doesn't go belly up. 
It undoes a very careful balance between the share of the risk that the student takes, that the guaranty agencies take, and that the Federal Government takes. It unbalances it. It would put about 22 guaranty agencies out of business. 
The present system, which is the FFEL system, is working very well. The direct lending is helped with competition. The last thing we want to do is put out the system which takes care of 80 percent of the colleges and 66 percent of all loans. 
It is a dangerous amendment. And I strongly oppose it.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. 
Mr. President, our passage today of the IRS restructuring bill is a tribute to the dogged and determined efforts of Finance Committee Chairman Roth. This reform effort originated with the report of the bipartisan National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, filed just over a year ago. It was given further impetus by the historic Finance Committee IRS oversight hearings held last year. Those hearings were the first comprehensive oversight hearings ever undertaken by the Finance Committee. They showed us how miserable the lives of average, law-abiding taxpayers could be when they ran afoul of a tax collection agency that was at best uncaring, and at worst abusive. Many taxpayers' suffering was prolonged; their cases got lost in an IRS black hole and took years to resolve. These oversight hearings really struck a nerve with the public, which flooded our offices, and the Finance Committee, with further complaints of abuse, mistreatment, and inattention. There were widespread calls for IRS reform. This public response not only led to further oversight hearings, but it also showed that any reform effort needed to be comprehensive, addressing a range of issues broader than those that surfaced during our oversight hearings. To his credit, Chairman Roth resisted calls for a quick fix, adopting instead a methodical, thoughtful approach to reform. 
The result represents the most comprehensive reform of the Internal Revenue Service in more than 45 years. This bill contains over 50 new taxpayer rights, leveling the playing field for taxpayers. It calls for an innovative oversight board. It assures that Congress will no longer shirk from oversight responsibilities. It calls for innocent spouse relief for taxpayers, usually women, who were the unknowing victims of former spouses that underpaid their taxes. 
There are three aspects of this bill that I believe are especially significant and on which I want to focus my remarks. The first is the new organizational structure at the IRS. Until now, the IRS has been administered by the Commissioner and his or her subordinates, many of whom have spent their entire career at the IRS. Since World War II, every commissioner has been a tax lawyer. Last year, Commissioner Charles Rossotti, a non-attorney, skilled in the areas of information management and familiar with the problems inherent in running a large organization, took the reins. With over 100,000 employees, the IRS presents a significant management challenge. Effectively managing an agency the size of the IRS requires skills other than those necessary for tax law enforcement. With a fresh viewpoint, Commissioner Rossotti has already made some proposals for reform that look promising. He has proposed to restructure the agency on a functional, rather than geographic, basis. This will allow functional units of the IRS to develop in-depth expertise in specific aspects of tax law and to provide more efficient service. The re-structuring bill builds on this fresh point of view, directing the Commissioner to implement an organizational structure with units serving particular groups of taxpayers with similar needs. 
Further, this legislation bill will assure that the IRS continues to benefit from fresh ideas. Administration of the IRS will be supplemented by new nine-member board, responsible for oversight of administration, management, conduct, direction of the IRS, as well as administration and execution of the tax laws. The majority of the board will be outsiders with expertise in such areas as customer service and management of large service organizations. These outsiders, not wedded to the current way of doing things, will be able to offer valuable input on new ways of doing business and will provide an important link to expertise from the private sector. To my knowledge, this type of public-private management partnership is unprecedented. 
An IRS employee representative is also on the oversight board. The presence of an employee representative on the board generated a substantial amount of controversy. In my view, inclusion of this representative will be key to the success of any future reform efforts. Reforming the IRS is not going to work unless it enjoys the support and understanding of those charged with carrying out the reforms. The employee representative's input will be very valuable, enabling board members unfamiliar with the day-to-day IRS operations better assess the impact and workability of reform proposals. 
Another aspect of this act that I think is particularly important is its emphasis on quicker and fairer dispute resolution. Taxpayers I have talked to are really bothered by the length of time it takes to resolve problems at the IRS. While cases await resolution, interest and penalties on unpaid taxes continue to accumulate. Frequently, the amount of interest due on unpaid taxes ends up exceeding the amount of taxes themselves. This bill contains several provisions that should make dispute resolution faster and more efficient. First, it provides that if the IRS doesn't contact taxpayers within a year after they file their returns, interest and penalties will not continue to accrue until the IRS sends the taxpayer a notice that additional taxes are due. 
Second, the bill mandates that the Commissioner's restructuring of the IRS include an independent appeals function. This appeals unit is intended to provide a place for taxpayers to turn when they disagree with the determination of front-line employees. A truly independent appeals unit will assure that someone takes a fresh look at taxpayers' cases, rather than merely rubber-stamping the earlier determination. 
This legislation also broadens the powers of the IRS Taxpayer Advocate. This will be especially important to taxpayers who find themselves facing immediate and serious harm as the result of actions taken by the IRS. In cases of hardship, the Taxpayer Advocate can intervene to issue taxpayer assistance orders, requiring the IRS to release seized property or otherwise refrain from taking action that could result in a significant hardship. The definition of `significant hardship' is expanded. This should make taxpayer assistance orders more widely available. In addition, the bill provides that persons appointed to the post of Taxpayer Advocate must agree not to accept employment with the IRS during the five-year period following their tenure. This will assure that they won't hesitate to overturn IRS actions out of concern about offending future bosses or co-workers. 
These provisions represent important steps to cut down on the time it takes to resolve disputes. In addition, the bill provides for informal Tax Court proceedings in certain types of small cases, giving more taxpayers, usually without lawyers, a greater opportunity to resolve disputes that cannot be resolved administratively. Expanded criteria for installment agreements and offers-in-compromise should mean that more taxpayers will be able to take advantage of those settlement tools. 
The last aspect on which I want to comment is the role that Congress will play in these reforms. With more frequent Congressional oversight, perhaps a bill of this scope might never have been necessary. With more oversight, we in Congress might better to be able to identify and address problems when they first arise. This bill imposes oversight responsibilities on Congress. It will assure that the Committees of Congress with jurisdiction over the IRS will hold an oversight hearing at least once a year. 
In addition, this measure requires that when Congress passes a tax bill, it must consider the practical consequences of tax law changes. Our tax system is built on the principles of self-reporting and self-assessment. Luckily, we have relatively high compliance rates from individual taxpayers. The increasing complexity of our tax laws, however, threatens to undermine voluntary compliance. The more complex the law becomes, the more difficult we make it for taxpayers to comply. The bill provides that IRS should comment on the administrability of tax law amendments when they are under consideration by the tax-writing committees. The IRS must also submit an annual report on sources of complexity in administering the tax code. Finally, the bill requires committee reports to include an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation of complexity and administrability issues. When we considered the tax law proposals in the Taxpayer Reform Act of 1997, it would have been helpful to know how those proposals would translate into new record keeping and paperwork requirements for taxpayers. This analysis will be a helpful, welcome addition to the legislative process. 
I suspect that nothing we do will make the IRS loved, but this bill makes it a kinder and gentler agency. It will be an agency guided by principles of fairness, rather than the bottom line and an agency held accountable for its actions, no longer out of control. Any organization the size of the IRS is going to experience some problems, and adoption of this conference report isn't going to solve every problem in our tax collection process. Still, it is our obligation here in Congress to see that those problems are minimized to the largest degree possible. This bill marks the beginning of fundamental structural changes at the IRS; it changes the way the IRS does business. It also provides important new protections for taxpayers embroiled in a dispute with the IRS. Most taxpayers pay their taxes and never again hear from the IRS. These taxpayers may not appreciate any immediate consequences of the new taxpayer protections. All of us, however, should benefit from a more efficient and effective tax collection process that I hope will result from the sweeping reforms we initiate today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, yesterday the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3130, the Child Support bill by unanimous consent. Today, the Senate will pass the same bill. One provision in the bill affects qualified medical child support orders, a provision in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and a matter under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Senators Kennedy, Coats and myself were conferees on that provision. 
I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Roth for including a description of the changes we agreed upon in his explanatory material. It is terribly important that this explanation be made a part of the legislative history on medical child support orders.. 
There are 700,000 children in the United States today who are eligible for medical support from a non-custodial parent. All too often when the States attempt to enforce a medical child support order, the plan sponsors have had fiduciary concerns regarding some aspect of the medical support order and, consequently medical benefits were denied to the child. Hopefully, this legislation will alleviate those concerns and more children will be covered under private health benefit plans. The legislation requires the Departments of Health and Human Services and Labor to quickly promulgate a model Medical Support Order form that States must use to collect medical support for children. It also requires those Secretaries to appoint and to collaborate with a Working Group to improve the process by which these medical support orders are implemented. 
I am happy that we were able to reach agreement on this important language. I want to take this opportunity to thank Senators Kennedy and Coats, and their staff, for all their assistance. Also, I thank Chairman Bill Goodling of the House Workforce Committee, Chairman Bill Roth of the Senate Finance and Senator Jay Rockefeller, for their help and guidance in reaching an agreement. In particular, Mr. Bill Sweetnam, Senior Counsel to the Finance Committee and Ms. Mary Bissell of Senator Rockefeller's staff provided the technical expertise, knowledge of State programs and support we needed to finish the job. 
I look forward to the Labor and Human Resources Committee exercising its oversight authority to see that this legislation is properly implemented and that we work toward improving collection of medical child support for every child to which such support is legitimately owed.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the defense authorization bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation we consider each year and by far the largest annual authorization bill. Even though the bill's overall numbers are huge by comparison to most others, the Department of Defense is being forced to make difficult spending decisions and curtail its program requests for future years in order to live within a budget that has shrunk in real terms. I recognize that this is a difficult challenge. 
However, I feel compelled to bring to my colleagues attention a matter of great concern to me--funding for the National Guard. The Department of Defense has not given sufficient attention or resources to this important component of our national defense. We all understand the importance of the Active Duty forces, and support for the active component must be strong. However, this must not come at the expense of an equally important component--the National Guard. I need not belabor the virtues of the National Guard for most of my colleagues. They are familiar with the cost savings that come from assigning duties to the National Guard. Senators also appreciate the critically important role the Guard plays in times of emergency in our own States. And most Members of Congress understand the intangible political benefits that come from having citizen soldiers and from maintaining a force that is intertwined with the fabric of daily life in every state to a much greater degree than the active component. The National Guard and Reserves are the face of the US military for many Americans, yet they continue to get second billing when it comes to the distribution of resources. 
In particular, I am concerned about the unintended consequences of National Guard Bureau formulas for distributing manpower and resources among the various Guard units. The current system gives priority to top tier units, which would seem to make sense at first glance, as those are the ones maintained at the highest readiness levels. However, the funding allocated to each unit then comes together somewhat randomly to form the mosaic of each State's National Guard and Reserve forces overall funding. Distortions sometimes creep in that cannot be corrected at the State level. I have found this to be true in the technician end strength levels projected for my State's National Guard for the coming years. A steady drop over the past few years combined with a projected cut of 15 percent next year would put the Vermont Guard in a very difficult position. It is quite possible that the resources coming to Vermont in the near future to support its essential operations will fall well below the acceptable level, and below what I believe even the National Guard Bureau would recognize as appropriate. The Vermont Guard has performed exceedingly well, winning national recognition in some instances, even though most of its units have been resourced at only 55 percent. But with projected cuts to 35 percent, for a drop of 20 percent over three years, I worry that Vermont will have to make cuts in its core program, like closing armories. 
Mr. President, each State's National Guard is a unique compilation of duties and responsibilities, all deemed critical to our national defense. No State's mission should be slighted because the formulas don't allow for an overall assessment of the aggregate funding level and an opportunity to correct shortfalls that are deemed unreasonably harsh for any one State. I can only assume that a few other States' National Guards are suffering in much the same manner as Vermont is. 
The Armed Services Committee has been helpful to Senator Leahy and me in our efforts to address this problem. We offer this amendment to direct the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to examine the process of resource distribution and, in particular, to evaluate the effects of these allocations upon each State's ability to carry out its missions. This report should also shed light on the aggregate effects of the current formulas for determining allocation and distribution of full-time manning strengths. I trust that this report will clarify the exact nature of this problem and allow the Pentagon and Congress to address it directly next year. 
We have agreed not to specify minimum end strength levels for military technicians, but we trust that the Committee will make every effort to recede in conference to the minimum end strength levels endorsed by the House of Representatives in its authorization legislation. 
I appreciate the support the Committee has given us in this effort and I urge my colleagues' endorsement of this amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, it is my pleasure to come to the floor of the Senate today to inform my colleagues of something very special that happened this morning during the committee's mark-up of S. 2206, the Human Services Reauthorization Act. 
The Human Services Act, as many of my colleagues know, authorizes a number of important programs, such as Head Start and the various activities under the Community Services Block Grant that provide services to families and communities in need. For the past 30 years, the State, local and federal governments have worked jointly under this program to help lift our most vulnerable citizens out of poverty and into self-sufficiency--one of the most noble goals of a responsible government. Moreover, the programs in the Human Services Act has done this effectively, and with widespread community involvement. 
In the Labor and Human Resources Committee, the Subcommittee on Children and Families--which is chaired by our colleague, Senator Dan Coats of Indiana--has been responsible for much of the heavy lifting that has to be done as these programs make their way through our committee for the fifth time in the last twenty years. The Human Services Act is a large and very important act, so its reauthorization is never an easy process, especially in a committee as diverse as ours. While broad bipartisan support for the reauthorization bill is always a desirable goal, it is never a given. And this year, Senator Coats worked overtime to make sure that his bill would not only responsibly reauthorize the Human Services Act, but would also do so in a way which accommodated the concerns and requests of members on both sides of the aisle. Consequently, the Labor and Human Resources Committee approved the reauthorization of the Human Services Act by a unanimous vote of 18 to 0. 
But Mr. President, I am not here today to make my pitch for the reauthorization of the Human Services Act--that will come soon enough. Rather, I want to highlight Senator Coats' hard work on this legislation. It is yet another illustrative example of the years of service that Senator Dan Coats has committed to strengthening families, strengthening children, and strengthening communities. It is typical of Senator Coats that he does so in a manner that is always tenacious, but never brash. While he is always accommodating, he never loses sight of the ultimate goal of helping families and communities. And with his quiet demeanor and a wit that I think sometimes surprises even him, Senator Coats is always a pleasure to work with, especially when it is for a common goal, as it was in this morning's mark-up. 
As we all know, Senator Coats has announced he will not be returning to this body when his term expires at the end of the 105th Congress. However, his departure does not mean his voice on behalf of children and families will be any quieter. Senator Coats will move into a new leadership role as President of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of the USA. This is a program that I know is very near to Senator Coats' heart, and the Senate's loss is clearly Big Brothers/Big Sisters' gain. 
In the Labor Committee, and in the Senate as a whole, we will miss Dan Coats. We will miss his leadership, and we will miss his friendship. When someone who is such a good friend leaves, it is sometimes difficult to know just what to give that friend of yours as a token of your affection. Well, Mr. President, at this morning's mark-up of the Human Services reauthorization, we gave it a try. 
It is with real pleasure that I inform the Senate that this morning the Labor and Human Resources Committee unanimously agreed to name the 1998 reauthorization of the Human Services Act as the `Community Opportunities, Accountability, Training and Educational Services Act,' or, as we prefer to call it, the COATS Act. We did this in recognition of all that Senator Coats has done not only on this bill, but for children and families throughout his career. 
Mr. President, I know there will be more time later to honor Senator Coats for all that he has done here in the Senate. But sometimes time gets away from us and we never let some of our colleagues know how much they mean to us. The action by the Labor Committee this morning is a modest gesture, but a sincere one. I think Senator Coats knows that it is from all of our hearts. We shall miss you, Senator.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I have closely monitored Americans' access to health insurance coverage in order to have a better understanding of the trends and underlying causes of declining coverage. Today, I am releasing a new U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report, entitled Private Health Insurance: Declining Employer Coverage May Affect Access for 55- to 64-Year-Olds (GAO/HEHS-98-133). This report examines access of the `near elderly' population to employer-based and individually purchased private insurance. Specifically, the report discusses the employment, income, health, and health insurance status of the near elderly, their ability to obtain employer-based health insurance if they retire before becoming eligible for Medicare, and their health insurance coverage through the individual market or employer-based continuation insurance. The findings of this report will be the focus of a Labor Committee hearing scheduled for June 25, 1998. 
This report and the related hearing have been prompted by a growing concern that several factors may converge to create the situation where a large number of 55- to 64-year-old Americans could lose, or have to pay considerably more for, health insurance coverage. Access to affordable health insurance is especially critical for this population, since their health status is worse than that of any other age group except the elderly who have the guarantee of Medicare. 
The near elderly population can be characterized as a group in transition. Their employment status, income, and health are all changing. The GAO reports that currently about 14 percent of the near elderly have no health insurance. Although this rate is lower than that of the nonelderly population in general, the GAO found several disturbing trends that could lead to a substantial increase in the numbers of near elderly without health insurance coverage. This would be especially problematic, since the near elderly have 25 percent lower median family incomes, but 45 percent higher health care expenses than younger age groups. The economic impact would be even greater when `baby boomers' join the near elderly, swelling their ranks from 21 million now, to 35 million by 2010. 
Most of the near elderly acquire health insurance coverage from one of the same three sources as individuals in other age groups: their employers, the individual private insurance market, or the Government. The main difference between coverage for the near elderly and the elderly is that all elderly qualify for Medicare, but only those near elderly who are ill or disabled qualify for public benefits. The main difference between coverage for the near elderly and younger populations is that a larger proportion of the near elderly are covered by public programs or have individual coverage through the private market. The near elderly are more likely to be willing to purchase individual coverage than younger age groups, because they are more averse to the risk of high health care costs. 
The two main factors contributing to the trend for more near elderly to become uninsured are the loss of employer-based coverage and the rising costs of individual insurance. The GAO reports that in 1996, 65 percent of the near elderly had employer-based insurance; but, despite the strong economy, this coverage is being eroded, particularly as the near elderly retire. Already the rate of health coverage offered by large employers to retirees has fallen faster than that of coverage for active employees, from an estimated 60 to 70 percent in the 1980s to less than 40 percent now. In addition, retirees are being asked to cover a larger share of the premiums. For example, in 1995, retirees contributed an average of $655 more for family coverage than did active workers. The higher costs have prompted some near elderly to drop coverage. The GAO reports that 27 percent of the 5.3 million retirees who discontinued employer-based benefits in 1994 cited expense as a factor. 
Retirees also are finding that more employers are linking retirement health benefits to length of service. The GAO report cites the example of one company's requiring 35 years of service to qualify for the maximum employer contribution of 75 percent. This trend does not bode well for retirees who have changed jobs frequently. 
The source of health insurance for the near elderly generally correlates with employment, health, and income status. The GAO reported that near elderly who had individual health insurance were more likely to be employed, be in good health, and have higher incomes than those on Medicare and Medicaid. The correlation is not absolute, however, because 20 percent of the uninsured had family incomes of more than $50,000 per year, and one-third of near elderly with individual insurance had incomes of less than $20,000. It should be noted that the latter figure may be misleading because this group may have less-expensive coverage, less-comprehensive benefits, or the income measured may not have included all of their resources. 
In general, the near elderly are more likely than younger age groups to purchase insurance through the individual market if they lose employer-based coverage. Often, however, they find that they do not qualify because of preexisting conditions, or that the cost of individual coverage is prohibitive because premiums take into account the fact that this age group uses more medical services than younger age groups. The GAO found that premiums for individual coverage constituted 10 percent of the median family income for the married near elderly in Colorado, which is almost twice as much as the retiree share of employer-subsidized family coverage. 
Some States have provisions guaranteeing access to some form of individual coverage, but in most States individual insurance for the near elderly is limited by exclusion of certain conditions or body parts, or denial of coverage. Chronic conditions that are common in this age group such as diabetes and heart disease, and even such non-life-threatening conditions as chronic back pain, may limit eligibility for coverage. Reform measures that have been considered or implemented to remedy these problems include initiatives to limit variation in premium rates; guarantees of certain products to all applicants; and State pools for those who have been rejected by at least one carrier. These measures have met with variable success. Overall, the GAO found that about 15 percent of all applicants were denied individual coverage, while many others were denied coverage for specific conditions. 
Since 1986, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) has provided temporary access to health insurance for individuals of all ages who leave the work force. COBRA may be particularly important to the near elderly before they become eligible for Medicare. It is attractive for continuation coverage, because its premiums reflect lower group coverage rates, and it does not exclude preexisting conditions. However, several factors limit the near elderly's ability to use COBRA benefits: It is available only to retirees whose employers have at least 20 employees and who offer health insurance benefits; it lasts for only 18 months; and it may not be affordable since employers do not provide contributions. It also is important to note that many people who could benefit from this program do not know about it. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also guarantees that some people who leave group coverage have access to individual coverage and cannot be excluded for preexisting conditions. However, HIPAA has stringent eligibility requirements, depends on exhausting COBRA or other continuation benefits, and places no limits on the cost of premiums. 
Before HIPAA was enacted, individuals usually relinquished COBRA before they had used up all of their benefits. The impact of HIPAA on the use of COBRA remains to be determined, but cost may prevent many near elderly from being able to afford to take advantage of either. The GAO reports that whereas one company paid almost the entire cost of health benefits for active employees, the COBRA cost ranged from about $5,600 to almost $8,000 per year for family coverage. This is a great deal of money, particularly for people who are taking advantage of the program because they are leaving the work force. 
I believe the GAO report, Private Health Insurance: Declining Employer Coverage May Affect Access for 55- to 64-Year-Olds (GAO/HEHS-98-133), will be an important resource as Congress considers proposals to expand health insurance coverage.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment at an appropriate time, probably around noon. What I want to talk about is national policy with respect to renewable energy. 
I started on this issue back when I first came to Congress, which was in 1975, when this Nation woke up and realized that we were very vulnerable to the supply of oil. At that time, you may remember, we had lines of cars waiting for gasoline. We had terrible shortages. We realized that this Nation, in order to make sure that it had a future, had to do something about it. Working with my friends in the House, at that time we established a wind energy program, which is still going strong. We also increased the funding in research into solar energy and the advantages that it gives to our society to recognize that the Sun is a tremendous source of energy and that it can be harnessed. We also looked at biomass options as well. 
Subsequent to that, when I came to the Senate, I also worked with the committee that handles it on the authorizing side. We developed a national policy. I had hoped that national policy would have mandated the course of action necessary to get this Nation to have 30 percent of its energy supplied by renewable sources. However, every word of my amendment was adopted except one, and that one was, instead of `shall,' it said `may.' That kind of switched things around as far as its importance. But the importance to continue to move forward to shift our dependence on foreign oil is something that has not gone away. 
At that time, we established a chart of where we ought to be. Right now, under that chart of going towards 30 percent of our energy to come from renewable, it is at 10 percent. That is where we are supposed to be on course. We are not. We are at 8 percent. 
What has happened now in this bill is that we have seen that renewables are cut and whereas, although things are perhaps more popular, or whatever items are increased, renewables are cut. Last year we got an additional $20 million approved, but when it got to conference, it disappeared. We are not making the kind of progress that this Nation needs in order to be able to become less dependent and, hopefully, someday independent of foreign sources. 
If we look at the world situation now, we should understand that the largest amount of oil right now to take out of the ground, so to speak, is not available. The Crimean, which is one of the most volatile areas in the world, has the most oil that has to be looked to for the future. I think it is about 70 percent of what is available at the world level. The second area is the Persian Gulf. Obviously, neither of those is very close to us. So our dependency is increasing. 
If you want to take a volatile area, you ought to take Crimea, right in the middle of one of the most volatile situations right now, including the areas of Pakistan all the way up through to Russia at the other end. And you have Iran and Iraq in the area. Those are areas that the pipelines would have to go through. Incredibly, also with expanding availability of nuclear weapons, these are very fragile areas. To think that we would have to rely upon them is very difficult. The same is true also, of course, with the Persian Gulf. Everyone is familiar with the problems we had in the Persian 
Gulf and the nonreliability at certain times of the availability of that oil. 
The question is, What should we do? We decided years ago that we could get to 30 percent, really, with utilization and to a large extent of biomass, as well as wind and solar energy, and that we could do it with little or no increase in the cost of availability of the fuel, but it could give us the kind of utility we need. As I pointed out, we have not made any progress in recent years. In fact, we are sliding back from where we ought to be. 
So the amendment that Senator Roth and I will offer today is about priorities. I think we all agree that increased domestic energy production should be a priority. We would agree that a lower balance of payments should be a priority. We would stand up to U.S. companies selling U.S. manufactured energy technologies in overseas markets. We would cheer the increased jobs, which would mean for every State in the Nation. We would support the small companies across this Nation working to capture the booming global energy market. We would make it a priority to increase domestic energy production and promote clean air. But that is not what has happened here. The bill before us further whittles away at our Nation's efforts to wean itself from foreign oil. 
The priorities in the bill for our Nation's energy policy go back years. This legislation will erode our efforts to develop technologies that increase domestic energy production. This bill ends commitments made to small energy companies that depend on Federal assistance to enter the giant global energy market. The funding levels contained here reduce our Nation's efforts to make major advancements in energy development, energy that is affordable, that is a clean, and, most importantly, made in America. 
Today, Senator Roth and I offer an amendment to increase our Nation's investment in clean domestic production. The amendment would restore funding to the Department of Energy's renewable research and development budget. 
Mr. President, the fiscal year 1999 energy and water appropriations bill cuts funding for solar, cuts funding for wind, cuts funding for biomass, cuts funding for hydrogen, cuts funding for geothermal, and cuts funding for hydropower research and development by $120 million, or 33 percent below the administration's request, and $20 million from the fiscal year 1998 level. 
This $380 million account takes a $120 million cut. The amendment we offer today simply attempts to add back half this level, or $70 million, to the renewables budget. 
A vote for this amendment is a vote to reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil from rogue nations like Iraq. A vote for this amendment is a vote to support small businesses all across the United States that produce clean renewable energy products. A vote for this amendment is a vote to help the same small businesses grab onto a chunk of that rapidly growing export market for renewable products. A vote for this amendment is a vote for cleaner air for our children. 
Mr. President, I am going to address each of these reasons of why my colleagues should support this bill in turn. 
Nearly half of all of our Nation's oil is imported today. These imports account for almost $60 billion, or 36 percent; 36 percent of the trade deficit is in this one area. These are U.S. dollars being shipped overseas to the Middle East which could be put to better use here at home. 
Consider the following chart, chart No. 1. This chart shows that the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that we will import even more of our oil, two-thirds of all oil we consume, by the year 2020. That means we will continue to be held hostage by oil-producing nations, including rogue nations like Iraq. 
This chart, as you can see way out here, shows we are just going to have increased prices in oil and all sorts of difficulty as we get out to 2020. U.S. petroleum imports are expected to reach two-thirds of consumption in the year 2020. 
Our second chart, Mr. President, shows that we are not alone in our increasing dependence on foreign sources of oil. The Energy Information Administration also predicts that by the year 2020 the Persian Gulf will supply one-half of the world's oil exports--one-half. Why would we continue to increase our addiction to that very volatile area of the world? 
We can reduce our dependence on Persian oil by continuing our investment in a clean domestic energy. I believe that these charts demonstrate very clearly that action must be taken. The goals that we set a few years ago to say that we should be at 30 percent of renewables must be adhered to. 
Chart No. 3 shows that the United States currently obtains 8 percent of our energy from renewable sources. That is OK, but we can do better. We should do better. We must do better. In fact, in 1991, during consideration of the Policy Act, the Congress agreed to an amendment to boost our percentage of renewable power to 20 percent by the year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010. How will we ever get there if we keep cutting our commitment to the small businesses across the Nation that are moving forward with these technologies? 
Chart No. 3, as you can see, indicates what we had in 1996. We had petroleum, 38.1 percent; nuclear, 7.6; renewables, 7.9; coal, 22.4; natural gas, 24 percent. 
This percentage--7.9--if we were on target, if we were doing what we agreed to do when the act was passed, would now be 10 percent. It is not approaching the goal that we have agreed upon as a national priority. 
Chart No. 4 shows that renewable energy is produced in every State in the United States. I think all Senators ought to take that into consideration. What you are doing is hurting the small businesses located in every State in the United States. Every Senator in the United States is a stakeholder in the 
debate we are having on the floor today. 
Let us take a look now at the next chart that we have. I think pictures make points better than words. I want to share with you pictures of a variety of renewable energy projects across the country. 
This is chart No. 5. It shows the Kotzebue Electric Association village power project. It is in Alaska. It is a wind project coming about from the bill that was put into effect at the end of the 1970s. 
This project will reduce emissions from diesel power and will reduce fuel transport costs to villagers. It is in existence. It is one that is easily replicated. It should be available, but we need to have more assistance, and we cannot cut back on that assistance which has been so productive in getting us the improvements we have had. 
Chart No. 6, this shows you the geographic distribution throughout our Nation. It shows that in the State of Oklahoma we have taxpayer dollars employing a geothermal heat pump in the State capitol building. This is geothermal, which obviously is another available energy supply, but we still need to have the research and the ability to replicate and duplicate and to find out better ways to be able to tap and utilize geothermal. 
Chart No. 7 gets to another--this one is where we have the most availability in this Nation and where we can proceed without in any way hampering the present energy sources. We have the ability in this Nation with all its agricultural resources to produce biomass energy which would allow us to go forward to get to the targeted goals. But that is cut back. 
This is the Bioten Biomass Plant, Red Boiling Springs, TN. This project produces energy from sawdust and will test other biomass fuels including wood residues and agricultural wastes. 
The next one we have is chart No. 8, which is the Stirling Dish Concentration Engine at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM--a great State, New Mexico. This system, created through a public/private partnership, uses heat generated by the Sun's rays to produce utility grade electric power. 
The next is a solar-powered school speed limit sign. This is an interesting use of solar energy--reducing dependence on electric power and ensuring that it works anytime the Sun is up, whether there are clouds or not. 
Chart No. 10 is entitled `Waterfront Office Buildings.' Mr. President, not only do these projects currently help, but they will not be moving forward as fast as they could if we don't at least put some of the money back that is used to fund it. Waterfront office buildings, these are located in Louisville, KY. These buildings are heated and cooled by geothermal heat pumps, saving the hotel $25,000 per month in utility costs. 
Mr. President, these are the types of things we are looking at. 
I see my good friend and cosponsor is here. If he would like to take some time, I am happy to yield the floor to him.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for his very eloquent statement and for his dedication to trying to get this Nation on the course it needs to be, to get off its dependency on oil. It has been a pleasure working with him over the years, and I look forward to continuing to do so. 
I also would like to add two other Senators as cosponsors of this amendment: Senator Moynihan of New York, and also Senator Allard from Colorado. 
Mr. President, when I turned over the discussion to Senator Roth, we were in the middle of going through charts which demonstrate right now the tremendous effort that is going on, and what needs assistance to make it even better, because we are sliding behind the results at this point of where we ought to be from these charts. 
The last one I showed, to start over again, is the Waterfront Office Building in Louisville, KY, where they are using geothermal--which, incidentally, can use heat to cool, which is sometimes a little confusing. But the way it uses its geothermal, it saves this hotel $25,000 a month. 
Now, let us take a look at some of these other charts so everyone here has a better opportunity to understand the depth of interest and the depth of participation in this Nation by private enterprises which are trying to reduce the Nation's dependence upon oil. That enthusiasm is out there, but it needs to be assisted. It needs to be demonstrated that we can even do better than we are doing, and we are nowheres doing as much as we used to be. 
The next chart, chart 11, indicates several States have greater wind potential than California, where the vast majority of wind development has occurred to date. The top 20 States for wind energy potential include North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Michigan, New York, Illinois, California, Wisconsin, Maine and Missouri. That just gives you an idea. We should add Vermont to that. Recently, we have opened our own wind production in the southern part of the State. But this shows the States right now, the top 20 States, as measured by their energy projections for wind. Obviously, wind is pretty free and there is a lot of it in this country. In fact, there is a lot of it right here in this Chamber, but we do need to better utilize it for a more effective presentation of our efforts to be able to save energy. 
Now, let's look at the next chart we have, chart 12. Consider the two quotes on this chart. The first quote reads: 
In 1995, worldwide wind-power generation capacity was 4,900 megawatts. . . . 
That is 1 million watts. 
That was China alone. 
The second quote reads: 
In the past 10 years, PV sales worldwide have more than quadrupled . . . In developing countries, demand has risen significantly, fueled by the recognition that PV systems are an attractive option to rural electrification in isolated, inaccessible communities that are distant from the power-- 
Sources. Those are photovoltaics. PV is photovoltaics, taking the Sun and converting it, through utilization usually of silicon, to electricity. It is a wonderful source. It is free. It comes from the Sun, and it is increasing worldwide. 
As it says here: 
In the past years, PV sales worldwide have more than quadrupled . . . In developing countries, demand has risen significantly, fueled by the recognition that photovoltaic systems are an attractive option for rural electrification in isolated, inaccessible communities that are distant from the power grid and have small electric requirements. 
This is a tremendous source for exporting our technology and our systems around the world. In fact, when I was in the House, I did get an amendment attached which made demonstration projects at our embassies throughout the world to demonstrate how usable the Sun is to produce power and how effective it is. 
In the past 10 years alone, photovoltaic sales worldwide have more than doubled. That is chart No. 12. American renewable businesses are taking advantage of these markets. 
Consider this chart, chart No. 13. This chart shows a wind turbine produced by a small wind turbine manufacturer in my State. This turbine was built in Vermont and exported to Ontario, Canada. There is a large market for export of U.S. wind turbines to northern communities in Alaska, Canada and Russia. This is a picture of one. We have several of these in Vermont now. They are throughout the world, and they are not at all offensive. They are quiet. They make a lot of energy. This is a large market for companies in this country. 
Although America is still a leader in developing renewable energy technologies, this lead may slip if we lower our renewable research and development funding. Europe and Japan continue to subsidize their renewable industry, putting U.S.-based companies at severe disadvantage. 
For example, Japan, Germany and Denmark use tied aid, offer financing and provide export promotion for their domestic industries, and our industries have to compete with that. It is very difficult to do, but because of the success and the fact that we have advantages, they have been able to survive with great difficulty without having that assistance or loans. This is not the time to lose our lead or to cut funding out to this important industry. 
Mr. President, there is one final reason why my colleagues should overwhelmingly support this amendment. This amendment is a vote for the environment. Renewable energy is largely free of the pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act. 
Chart No. 14 demonstrates this. Consider this geothermal power plant in Dixie Valley, NV. This plant, which produces electricity for 100,000 people produces no NOX emissions and 5 percent as much SOX and CO2 as a coal-fired power plant of the same size. Five percent, that is 95 percent reduction in the production of those pollutants. We need more of these plants, like the one in Dixie Valley, NV. 
Renewable energy can have other environmental benefits as 
well. Consider the following projects, all of which turn waste products into energy. 
Chart No. 15: Westinghouse Power Connection. This one is a biomass gasification test facility in Paia, Island of Maui, HI. A pilot project demonstrates potential to convert agricultural waste--sugar cane--into electricity. Again, back to biomass which has incredible use available to us. 
The next chart shows Wheelabrator Shasta Energy Co., a biomass project in Shasta County, CA. This project converts wood wastes that would otherwise end up in landfills into 49 megawatts of electric power. 
The next chart--if I am right, we should have 50, one for every State. We will see how we turn out here. This is the BC International Corporation biomass ethanol plant in Jennings, LA. This plant will be retrofitted to produce ethanol from sugar cane, bagasse and rice waste. 
The next chart will also demonstrate the number of plants we have spread throughout the country. This is in Connecticut; a fuel cell power plant, Groton, CT. The fuel cell plant uses hydrogen from landfill gas that otherwise would be wasted to create electricity. It is another indication of the tremendous breadth of expertise we have in this Nation to produce. All we have to do is make sure we don't cut back in their planning and ability to create many of the experimental plants. 
Let me now conclude by, again, reminding everyone, we are proposing to add $70 million in our amendment to the Department of Energy's solar, wind and renewable budget. Federal support for renewable energy research and development has been a major success story in the United States. Costs have declined, reliability has improved, and a growing domestic industry has been born. More work still needs to be done in basic research at our national labs and applied development to bring down the costs of production even further. This is a tremendous opportunity for this Nation to develop industries which will help us reduce our trade deficits. 
This is not a vote which pits Senators from one region of the country against Senators from another region. I think I have shown that all regions of the country benefit from renewable energy. This is not a vote which pits probusiness Senators against proenvironmental Senators. I think I have shown that renewable energy is a clean, environmentally beneficial industry. This is not a vote which pits Democrats against Republicans. 
Chart No. 19: Consider this quote from former President Bush in September 1991. President Bush stated:  
We must encourage environmentally responsible development of all U.S. energy resources, including renewable energy. Renewable energy does reduce demand upon our other finite natural resources. It enhances our energy security, and clearly, it protects the environment. 
So just before I offer the amendment, I would like to thank my colleagues who are cosponsoring it with me and urge--urge--my colleagues to sincerely consider the tremendous advantages which this amendment will have and to remind you, at present, we are cutting back--while going forward on other less necessary projects--we are cutting back on that which is most critical to the future of this Nation in its ability to gain the semblance of energy independence. We are slipping behind the chart and the goals that we have established. We cannot cut back in the funding that will help us get there.

Mr. President, after discussions with the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, I understand that we are in a position where the amendment can be accepted with striking a certain provision. I am doing that and am going to accept that proposition with the understanding that there will be a strong effort to fight to maintain the amendment as best they can in the committee of conference, because the history has been that on these amendments, which have been accepted in the past, they kind of disappear in conference. But I have the good-faith-effort commitment of the Senator from New Mexico, and I accept that, as I know him and I know his character; and the same with the Senator from Nevada. 
So, Mr. President, I now move to amend my amendment by striking all after line 8 on page 3 of the amendment.

I also know that you cannot promise anything when you get into conference, but I will also be watching very carefully because in the past we have not had any success in holding these amendments. 
I understand, though, that the administration is strongly in favor of more funding. I understand there may be additional funding in the health provision, so I expect that we will be able to get a significant increase at this time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few moments of the time of the Members to discuss a subject which I find probably no one has ever heard of but, nevertheless, is one of the very serious problems facing the world. I wish my colleagues a Happy World Day to Combat Desertification. 
I assume most Senators have never heard of this day, so let me explain. June 17 was established as World Day to Combat Desertification to promote awareness of dryland degradation. 
Few Americans today have an association with desertification. My parents and their contemporaries did: the great `Dust Bowl' that occurred in the western United States in the 1930s. Desertification is defined as land degradation in arid and semi-arid areas resulting from climatic variations and human activities. It can occur to such an extent that affected dryland can no longer sustain vegetation, crops, livestock or the people who depend on them for survival. In the 1930s, desertification forced farmers and their families off their land when topsoil--and their livelihood--blew away. Vermont is not arid. But as an agricultural State, Vermonters were pained by the plight of western farmers. The suffering of these farmers who became penniless migrants is still starkly visible in photos of the era. 
Hopefully, the U.S. will never experience another `Dust Bowl.' We have the expertise and resources to prevent such damage to U.S. agricultural lands. However, it threatens the way of life of one billion people worldwide in underdeveloped countries. The economic consequences of desertification are particularly devastating in regions that are both underdeveloped and arid. In these regions, much of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Subsistence farmers do not have the means or incentives to make investments in proper land and water management. Poor land and water management, especially when combined with periodic droughts, are the primary causes of desertification. Other factors include overcultivation, overgrazing, single-crop farming on fragile soil, slash-and-burn land clearing methods, and improper irrigation practices. These factors are often compounded by unwise government policies and the pressure of explosive population growth. When formerly productive farm and pastoral land is degraded, it creates a downward spiral of poverty and rural out-migration--often to the already overcrowded cities. We saw this during our own `Dust Bowl.' 
I was only a small child in the 1930s. I never met impoverished farmers dislocated by the `Dust Bowl.' But I have witnessed first hand the effects of desertification in Indonesia and Africa. I saw first hand how hard farmers are fighting to hold on to arable land in the face of huge environmental changes brought on by cutting of the rainforests or overgrazing of arid lands. And I saw the resulting poverty and dislocation that then grip these areas. 
Through our foreign aid programs, we are assisting afflicted regions. But we could use our resources more efficiently by joining 124 other nations in ratifying the 
U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and /or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. As the Administration began to sharpen its focus on Africa prior to the President's recent trip, it decided to make U.S. ratification a priority. On the occasion of World Day to Combat Desertification, I urge my colleagues to take a look at this treaty and reflect for a moment on the benefits to the U.S. of Senate ratification. 
The treaty is in the best interest of the United States. Our agriculture industry, American universities, and our non-governmental organizations have considerable expertise in combating desertification. Businesses like Monsanto, Land O' Lakes, and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association are supporting the treaty because it will increase U.S. business opportunities. Ratification will also increase export of American technical assistance in erosion control. The Irrigation Association supports it because many of its members produce world-class irrigation and water control equipment. After ratification, the U.S. may submit names of its desertification experts and consultants for the international Roster of Independent Experts who are available to provide services. 
The treaty does not commit the U.S. to any specific level of foreign assistance. Rather, it asks governments of developed nations to channel existing bilateral and multilateral aid funds through a new mechanism that will provide improved coordination and better use of donor resources. The treaty obligates recipient nations to develop actions plans `from the bottom up' to combat regional and local desertification. The treaty is remarkable because it calls upon local communities to take the lead in identifying their problems and selecting the best solutions for their particular situations. 
On World Day to Combat Desertification, let's not forget our own grim experience with desertification and the `Dust Bowl.' Let's join the other nations that have ratified the Convention to Combat Desertification and prevent a reoccurrence of this tragedy elsewhere.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, July 5, 1998, is a great day for Vermont as we celebrate the fiftieth birthday of the Newbrook Fire Department. On behalf of all Vermonters, I want to wish the department a very happy birthday. 
For a half-century, the volunteers at Newbrook's Fire Department have donated their time to provide fire protection to Vermonters living in the lower West River Valley area. These volunteers continually risk their lives to protect the welfare of others. The Newbrook Fire Department also responds to medical emergencies and, through the years, has earned the reputation as one of Vermont's most efficient volunteer response teams. This is truly admirable. I applaud such dedication and have the utmost respect for Newbrooks' courageous volunteers. 
The Newbrook Fire Department is a vital part of the Newbrook community and its surrounding areas. For fifty years, the Department has given prompt and reliable service to people in the most distressing situations. It gives me great pleasure to recognize today fifty years of service and achievement of the Newbrook Fire Department and, more importantly, the volunteers who support it.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will reconvene tomorrow at 10 a.m. and immediately resume consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill. It is hoped that Members who wish to offer amendments to the energy and water bill will come to the floor during Thursday's session to offer and debate their amendments under short time agreements. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible during Thursday's session of the Senate. The leader would like to remind Members that the Independence Day recess is fast approaching and, therefore, the cooperation of all Members will be necessary to make progress on a number of important items, including appropriations bills, any available conference reports, the Higher Education Act, the DOD authorization bill and any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the tobacco bill. As we all know, under the present circumstances, we don't seem to be making much progress. On the other hand, I have been here long enough to know that sometimes we go through these phases where we come to situations where we have sort of a partisan battle on how we should proceed, and then finally, after we do that for a while, we recognize that we both ought to sit down and try to reconcile our differences and join together to make sure we do not let this opportunity pass that we have before us, where we could do so much to help, on the one hand, stop teenagers from starting to smoke and, on the other hand, help those who are addicted to tobacco and do what we can to ensure that they are taken care of. 
One of the most sticky problems we have is what to do as far as how to compensate the victims of tobacco. We tried initially to have a system set up where the amount of money that would be subject to lawsuits and claims would be capped. That was killed with the Gregg-Leahy amendment. I have been involved in a number of issues over the years involving these kinds of matters, not the least of which was examining the situation with respect to asbestos, black lung disease, and other matters. 
And it seemed to me and to others that we ought to look at it as an opportunity to find a solution other than through the court system. 
I am here today to talk about an amendment that Senator Sessions, Senator Enzi, and I plan to offer in the Senate--in fact, it has already been placed on file--to see what we can do to try to find a more humane system to solve this very difficult situation. Hours, days, and weeks have been spent arguing about liability, per-pack tax levels, States rights, and other issues. 
But why are we really here? 
No. 1, to reduce teen smoking; and, most importantly, to assure that teens don't start smoking, because we know if they don't start smoking, the odds are they never will smoke. Also, to strengthen the public health program and to ensure that victims of smoking are compensated fairly. That is what I would like to concentrate on today. The amendment that we have will bring logic to the system of compensating individuals. 
As I mentioned earlier, throughout my time in Congress I have authored legislation to prevent smoking, supported increasing cigarette prices and requiring manufacturers to disclose the ingredients in cigarettes, and worked to reverse the impact of tobacco on the health of Americans. In fact, the present bill contains a substantial amount of the language that came from our committee in these areas. It has been adopted by the McCain bill. We have some very good provisions in the basic bill. We have a foundation to build upon. I have done all of these things hoping that together we could end the blight that cigarettes have brought to the lives of millions in this Nation. 
Any legislation that Congress approves must ensure that families and individuals harmed by tobacco receive compensation in a timely and equitable manner. I fear, though, that this legislation we are finally considering will not achieve that goal. I am sure it won't. That is why I am here today. 
With this bill, States are granted funds to begin to pay the health costs associated with smoking. Individuals, however, are left on their own to seek justice through the court system. You can only imagine the consequence of 50 million people bringing lawsuits. That is the number of potential claimants that you have. I know many lawyers out there are only all too ready to participate in this action. With up to 40 percent of the compensation going directly into their pockets, on the average, the lawyers in this Nation are happy to see this situation occur. But I am not sure that is the most equitable and fair way of doing it. Billions of dollars are at stake, and millions of people's lives are at stake. 
But if the legal profession benefits, who loses? Those truly deserving of compensation--smokers and their families facing serious health consequences from smoking--will be left counting pennies. Our amendment attempts to hand these funds to those Americans who must recover from the tragedy of their addiction, and their families. 
Our amendment would set up a compensation system designed by a bipartisan commission to award compensation to tobacco victims. This is not a situation where blame has to be determined--the tobacco companies admit to the linkage of smoking to illness. All we are concerned about here is how we should compensate. 
Also, there is a certain logic in one of the problems with bringing the court suits. It is a thing called `assuming the risk,' where the individuals have had years of looking at labels which tell them that it is a danger to their health. That creates a problem in the tort system as to how you award compensation. 
The asbestos cases, as I mentioned earlier, provide us with an example of what may happen if we rely only on the judicial system to resolve the millions of claims against the tobacco manufacturers. As I will show later, it shows you what kind of system came about from the asbestos cases because of the horrendous mess that occurred in the courts. In the asbestos situation, only hundreds of thousands of lawsuits were brought, and they brought the system to a stoppage. They created a catastrophe. When you think that tobacco could result in millions of cases, you can only imagine what would happen in the court system if this were allowed to continue with this as the only option. 
With asbestos, Federal judges struggled with an overwhelming backlog of lawsuits filed across the country on behalf of the asbestos victims. Many of these victims contracted fatal lung disease in working with the product. 
I add as a side note, because there is somewhat of a linkage here, that those who suffered from asbestosis and smoked ended up with a much worse situation. So we even have a linkage in that respect. 
Many victims died before the courts considered their case. These people never received the compensation they deserved in these cases. We cannot let this happen again in the tobacco case. 
Lawsuits over asbestos claims have been mired in the Federal and State courts for over two decades. These lawsuits are few compared to the millions that will arise related to tobacco. In fact, 200,000 asbestos cases were filed in which compensation has been paid. 
Another 200,000 cases are pending, and another 200,000 are projected to be filed in the future. Many of the 200,000 claimants who have received compensation have only received about 10 cents on the dollar of what they deserve. It is not getting any better for the remaining claimants. 
I shudder to think how long victims of tobacco will need to wait to make it through the courts. Must we again allow individuals to die, waiting for their cases to be heard or settlement to be reached? 
No, and we have the solution. No lengthy depositions, years waiting to get to courts, weeks of trial and so on. But first of all, let me talk a little bit about what happened in the asbestos situation. 
First of all, when the cases were brought the system came pretty much to a screeching halt, there were so many cases filed. Then awards were granted, heavy damage awards for the first victims. And what happened? The companies were driven into bankruptcy. Finally, in order to allow those companies to at least continue in business, a trust situation was set up so they are run by a trust. A certain amount of the available profits were made available for compensation to victims. However, also, to allow you to see how appropriate this kind of system might be in this case, they also were allowed, if they were not happy with compensation through the commission proposal, to sue. 
In the meantime, which has been a couple of years now that this system has been in effect, only one person has gone to the court after going through the compensation commission. 
Similarly, our amendment will create a commission to review the research and documents of the tobacco companies that they have long kept secret and compile a list of diseases linked to smoking and develop the compensation that these individuals deserve for their injuries. An individual harmed by smoking can simply apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for compensation and receive it in an expedited manner. 
Also, we have it worded such that we want to make sure--although we are talking billions of dollars here, that could rise up to many, many billions, up to $25 billion that could be held in trust for this purpose--we would make sure that those who are most harmed would be considered first. The compensation may be so huge, as far as all of the individuals who may be affected, that you want to make sure those who are permanently disabled or those who are terminally ill would be fully compensated before you get into the lesser harmed individuals. 
The amendment also gives these individuals the ability to appeal the decision that was reached if they feel it is appropriate. 
The program is funded by voluntary contributions from the tobacco manufacturers. If they refuse to participate, as was in the original part of the bill, they would be subject to the current use of the courts to get the injured parties their just compensation. 
The method we have developed would put compensating funds in the hands of victims and not their lawyers. As the asbestos cases show, individuals received less than 40 cents on the dollar of the compensation for the harm they incurred. The lion's share of the money went to make lawyers very wealthy. Why should we do so again? Our approach will avoid costly lawyers' fees and get the compensation to people who deserve it the most. 
The asbestos cases will also illustrate what will happen if we rely on lawyers and the courts to strangle the tobacco companies. The asbestos companies eventually went bankrupt, as I mentioned earlier, because of a few earlier judgments that gave claimants such large sums of money. Unfortunately, after companies went bankrupt, individuals who had their suits settled or a judgment reached received only 10 cents on the dollar for damages suffered. A majority of the harmed individuals received almost nothing. In fact, people suffering almost identical symptoms from asbestos exposure received vastly different awards, depending on the jury that heard their case. 
These lessons outline for me the importance of the approach we are taking to provide proper compensation to tobacco victims. The amendment will allow the claims to be sorted through and the funds distributed in a timely manner. With this we avoid the huge backlog of cases in our state and federal courts. We grant compensation before the injured parties are no longer with us. We ensure that tobacco victims will be given their due without lawyers taking a major cut. Finally, all injured parties will be guaranteed a source of funds and all similar claims will be treated equally. 
I would strongly urge my colleagues to carefully consider our amendment as an alternative to insure that individuals harmed by tobacco manufacturers will receive the full compensation they deserve in a timely and efficient manner. For our country, we cannot allow a repeat of the asbestos catastrophe, and most especially for the people that were harmed by the tobacco manufacturers.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to June Salander of Rutland, Vermont. On May 9, 1998 June Salander celebrated her bat mitzvah at the remarkable age of 89. Mrs. Salander is a dear neighbor, mentor, and friend from my days growing up in Rutland, Vermont. It is believed she is the oldest Rutlander to celebrate a bat mitzvah. Over a hundred people attended the ceremony, one of many indicators of the inspiration she is to her family, friends, community, and faith. 
Born in 1908 in Poland, June Salander came to America in 1920 to New York City with her family via Ellis Island. In 1941 she married her husband and moved to Vermont where she has resided ever since. In her many years as a citizen of Rutland she has been an active member of the community. She has served as a volunteer at the Rutland Jewish Center, as a Hebrew School teacher, and at the Rutland Hospital with the Grey Ladies. 
In addition to filling the role as a bedrock member of her community she has also filled many stomachs with her famous cooking. Her strudel is legendary throughout the area and to the many people traveling through who she has opened her home to over the years. Her strudel recipe was even featured in a cookbook containing Jewish recipes honed in the United States. I can personally attest to the greatness of June Salander's cooking as I was able to eat breakfast at the Salanders when I was growing up as a boy on Kingsley Avenue in Rutland. She continues to teach cooking informally and will appear on a cooking video that will air on PBS in the near future. 
Perhaps her most admirable quality is the energy she continues to display as she reaches her golden years. For some it means an idle time in their life but not for June Salander. When she was sixty-two she received her real estate license and remained active until recently. She picked up tennis when she was seventy-three and played for almost ten years. This fall she will travel all the way to Israel to attend the wedding of a niece. 
I am glad my wife Liz was able to attend June's bat mitzvah on that Saturday and pass on our well wishes to June. I also wish her well as she approaches her ninetieth birthday on June 28, 1998. Mr. President, I would like to publicly recognize June's upstanding citizenship and the inspiration she is to the rest of us as she continues to embrace life into her nineties.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fallen hero. His name is Donald Bodette and he passed away last August 10th after a long battle with cancer. However, his legacy lives on and he will be honored on June 14th at the Dodge Development Center in Rutland. 
Don retired from the Marine Corps in 1968 and received a Purple Heart for wounds sustained in Vietnam. For those of us who knew Don, This information was a well kept secret. He was never inclined to tell you about his heroics. He did tell war stories as a way to draw other Vietnam Veterans out of their isolation. Don's theory was a very simple one and is the premise used today to help Vietnam Veterans worldwide--discussing traumatic war experiences with another veteran with a similar experience is the best way to heal. 
An article in The Rutland Herald on August 12, 1997 announced that Donny had passed away, at age 48, at the VA hospital in White River Junction. As I read, I was struck by some of the tales recounted by his fellow veterans. Three of Don's best friends, Jake Jacobsen, Albert Trombley and Clark Howland, talked about meeting Don through a newspaper ad that only said, `Vietnam Veterans, we need to talk.' According to Trombley, `He didn't have any master plan. He would stop and look for people, he would put advertisements in the paper to get veterans to come out, and once he found one or two, they would find two or three. He got all around the state of Vermont.' 
In the late 1970s, Don was instrumental in shaping the course of a fledgling organization known as the Vietnam Veterans of America (VA). He believed that the VA should be more than an activist group, and Don was so successful in his efforts to establish local chapters that Rutland, Vermont boasts the first VA chapter in the country. According to Jake Jacobsen, `Donny and I never worried about membership. If we're good enough, they'll want to join us.' 
Don helped found the Veterans Assistance Office (VAO) in Rutland sixteen years ago. It was designed as a non-profit community based organization to support veterans in a variety of different ways. The VAO still serves in that capacity today. The VAO's current director, Clark Howland, says of Bodette, `I owe him a lot. He helped an unknown number. I'd say it would run in the thousands of veterans. And what we're doing now is just to carry on for what Donny started.' 
Farewell Don. Your legacy of service will live on through your selfless acts that improved the lives of countless Vermont veterans.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, June 5, 1998, is a great day for Vermont and for the Nation as we open Vermont's first, and the Nation's newest, National Historic Park. On behalf of all Vermonters I want to welcome the National Park Service and express my deepest gratitude to Laurence and Mary Rockefeller for making this possible. 
Vermonters have always drawn a special strength from the land. And as Vermonters, we have a responsibility to the land. I was proud to introduce for myself, Senator Leahy and all Vermonters, the legislation that created this National Historic Park in 1991. A perfect `Vermont scale' National Park, its size fits our State's landscape, incorporating many of the most significant attributes about Vermont: our stewardship of the working agricultural and forest landscapes, our dedication to conservation, and our commitment and respect for our towns and communities. 
Mr. President, the beauty and significance of this site will now forever receive the same recognition as our other great National Parks, such as Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Gettysburg. 
George Perkins Marsh, Frederick Billings, and Laurence Rockefeller's devotion and commitment to the issues of conservation, forest management, and agriculture have helped develop this nation's attitudes for how we treat and respect our lands. Private land owners throughout the country have followed the example of these distinguished leaders. Today, those who work and own the land, and hold true to the ideals of Marsh and Billings, are this Nation's most important stewards. The preservation and conservation of the Nation's working landscape, and historic and natural resources are increasingly important and yet are becoming more difficult to maintain. The Marsh Billings National Park will forever serve Vermont and the Nation as a model for conservation. 
I salute Mary and Laurence Rockefeller for their vision in providing this park to the people of Vermont and the United States. The Rockefeller family has given future generations of Vermonters, indeed all Americans, access to a truly historic and beautiful site. This is only the most recent accomplishment in Mr. Rockefeller's more than 50 years of conservation leadership. Laurence Rockefeller was the first person ever awarded a Congressional Gold Medal for conservation work, and that award was richly deserved. I am proud to have been an original cosponsor of the legislation that granted him the award. 
Mr. President, the people of Woodstock and the entire State of Vermont have lived a long time in harmony with the landscape. Our first national park not only recognizes the two founders of the American conservation movement, it is a tribute to all Vermonters and to the Vermont way of life.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert R. Holmes who is retiring as the Chief of Police of Rutland, Vermont. Chief Holmes has had a long and distinguished career in law enforcement, and has served his community with dedication and honor. 
Chief Holmes began his career, which has spanned four decades, as a rookie patrol officer in Phoenix, Arizona in 1958. He later moved to Littleton, Colorado and within three years had attained the rank of Lieutenant. 
Chief Holmes served his country for 3 years in Vietnam as an international police adviser under the Agency for International Development. He returned to police work in Colorado in 1972, and became Chief of the Englewood Police Department in 1975, where he served in that capacity until his initial retirement in 1989. 
The same year he decided to accept the position of Rutland City's Chief of Police, and he and his wife relocated to Vermont. Since 1989, Chief Holmes has earned the respect and trust of his fellow law officers, as well as civic leaders and Rutland area citizens. He has provided sound leadership and has worked hard to bring about positive change in the department and the entire community. 
In January of 1997, the FBI honored Chief Holmes with the Agency's Community Leadership Award for his outstanding efforts to educate the public about the potential impact of the influx of gangs into Vermont. He is quick to share the credit for these successes with all of the officers involved, and is proud of their many accomplishments. 
Chief Holmes has served his country and several communities with distinction throughout his career, and will no doubt continue to make contributions in any endeavor he undertakes. I congratulate him on this special occasion and wish him and his family every future happiness.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lorraine W. Crowley of Rutland City, Vermont. For the last ten years Lorraine has served as the Elementary Principal for the Rutland City Public School System. It is with bittersweet emotions that I inform the Senate of Lorraine's retirement at the end of the school year. 
Lorraine has dedicated her career to education. She graduated from Emmanuel College in Boston in 1962 and received her Masters in Education Psychology from the University of Hawaii in 1968. She served as a Principal for five years at a High School in Hawaii, before returning to New England as the Director of Guidance at the Holliston High School in Massachusetts. Lorraine broadened her horizons further by spending 3 years as an educator at the American School in Madrid and the Ben Franklin International School in Spain. Since 1988 she has served as the Principal for Rutland City School System. 
Lorraine has dedicated her life to giving our next generation the tools they need to live prosperous and fulfilling lives. I know the entire Rutland City community will miss Lorraine Crowley. She is leaving a legacy of accomplishment and affection, the memory of which shall stand the test of time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to rise with my colleagues, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Specter, Senator Hollings, Senator Murkowski, and my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, to introduce the Veterans' Equality for Treatment and Services Act, or VETS Act, of 1998. This bill will give our Nation's veterans greater freedom to choose where they receive their medical care. 
Also known as `Medicare Subvention,' the VETS Act will authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs to set up 12 pilot sites around the country for Medicare-eligible veterans who are either barred from getting care at VA facilities, or cannot afford costly VA copayments. 
As members of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Rockefeller and I worked successfully last summer to pass this exact piece of legislation through the Senate Finance Committee. We were disappointed that before final passage of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act our legislation was replaced with a requirement to simply study the matter and issue a report. 
Well, we have studied the issue and it is now time to act. The Veterans Health Administration under the able leadership of Ken Kizer has devised Medicare Subvention payment methods and I have recently spoken with Secretary Togo West about our mutual commitment to the passage of Medicare Subvention in this Congress. 
Under current law, the VA will not generally treat a non-service connected Medicare-eligible veteran because they have no way to recover the full cost of doing so. Under the VETS Act, this same veteran could go to their VA for care and Medicare would reimbursement the VA at the normal Medicare rate. Total Medicare reimbursements would be limited to $50 million annually. The reimbursement level would be reduced if the VA treats fewer Medicare eligible veterans than in the prior fiscal year. The General Accounting Office would also monitor the operation of the sites and report on any increase in costs to Medicare. If the Demonstration Project increases Medicare's costs, the Veterans Affairs would reimburse Medicare for any increased costs and take action to suspend or terminate the program. Therefore, numerous safeguards and limitations in the bill ensure that Medicare Subvention does not drain the Medicare Trust Fund. 
Mr. President, we should give our veterans the ability to make the choice of where they will receive their medical care. Although last year's enactment of the Department of Defense Medicare Subvention program alleviated what veterans call a `lockout' from the military health care system, we need to finish the job by allowing all veterans access to the VA health care facility of their choice. 
In closing, the Veterans' Service Organizations strongly support the VETS Act. I look forward to working with them, Secretary West and the administration, and my colleagues here in the Senate and in the House to get this legislation signed into law this year.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, under the leadership of Chairman Roth, during this Congress the Finance Committee undertook in-depth oversight of the workings of the Internal Revenue Service. With a week of hearings last year, followed by more hearings just last week, the Senate brought the IRS under scrutiny, and revealed a side of the agency not seen before. 
What the Committee found at these hearings was alarming. We heard numerous stories of outrageous action by the IRS, including: 
 a criminal agent who sought to `make a name' for himself by fabricating charges against prominent public officials; 
 IRS supervisors who gave preferential treatment to taxpayers represented by former co-workers and to taxpayers represented by accounting firms where the supervisors hoped to work; 
 IRS reviewers who reversed auditors' recommended tax increases when taxpayers had competent, well-heeled representation, but allowed similar recommendations to go forward when a taxpayer didn't have a representative; 
 and IRS agents who conducted armed raids on businesses, even though there was no reason whatever to suspect violence or resistance. 
When an organization has over one hundred thousand employees, I suppose it is not surprising that some people are going to make mistakes. However, the abuses that came to light in the Finance Committee hearings struck a responsive chord with the public. From the mail and phone calls I received, I worry that the problems we heard about are not isolated incidents, but are symptomatic of an agency with real management problems. 
The bill adopted by the Finance Committee takes several approaches to address some of these problems. The measure calls for new ways of structuring, managing and overseeing the agency. The bill will ease some of the burdens imposed on taxpayers and gives taxpayers important new rights and protections to assert in their dealings with the IRS. The legislation will help assure that taxpayers understand their rights and that they understand how the tax collection system works. Finally, it makes continued oversight by Congress easier. 
One of the most important aspects of this bill is its provision for independent review of IRS actions throughout the examination and collection processes. A recurring complaint heard during the hearings was that the IRS serves as police, prosecutor, judge and jury. This legislation attempts to address that problem by calling for increased review of IRS actions and by erecting walls between the various players in the tax collection process to assure that those reviews are truly independent and not merely a rubber-stamp approval. 
Under this measure IRS officers will not be able to seize assets without previous independent review by their supervisors, and taxpayers can even request additional review of collection efforts. To assure the independence of the appeals unit reviewing proposed changes to a person's tax liability, the bill prohibits the appeals officer from having ex parte contact with the tax examiner who proposed the changes. When there are allegations of misconduct, the IRS will no longer investigate itself. Instead, inspections of alleged misconduct will be performed by the Treasury Department. Together with a newly independent Taxpayer Advocate, and a new Oversight Board composed primarily of outsiders, these provisions will assure that actions adverse to taxpayers are not taken without first having a fresh review by an unbiased eye. 
New taxpayer rights will also ensure that the IRS conducts reviews to make certain that the positions the agency takes are reasonable. The bill expands the situations in which taxpayers can recover costs incurred in defending themselves against the IRS. Under this bill, if taxpayers hire a lawyer or accountant to represent them before the IRS, and the agency takes an unjustified position that results in no change in tax liability, the taxpayer will be able to recover the costs incurred to fight the IRS, including costs incurred in administrative proceedings. The bill also provides that if the IRS rejects a taxpayer's offer to compromise a tax deficiency, continues to pursue the taxpayer, and ends up recovering less than the taxpayer's offer, the taxpayer can recover costs incurred after the time of the offer. 
The IRS has the power to destroy people's lives. These provisions will assure that this power is no longer concentrated in the hands of a single person and make more employees accountable for the agency's actions. The bill will also help ensure that proposed actions are reviewed for reasonableness. 
IRS employees will be forced to take their new responsibilities seriously; negligence in the exercise of their duties could be the basis for a new kind of taxpayer lawsuit. 
I want to commend Chairman Roth for his historic hearings on the IRS. I also want to commend him for not capitulating to calls for quick action on the House-passed bill, when the Finance Committee hearings made it apparent that more sweeping changes were needed. I believe that this bill will go far to restore public confidence in the IRS.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senate is resuming consideration of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, S. 1186. This legislation incorporates job training, vocational education, and adult education. 
Last Friday, the Senate began debate on S. 1186. Amendments by Senators DeWine, Domenici, Lautenberg, and Ashcroft were adopted and made a part of this substitute. We have only today to have the final vote on the legislation, and we have 1 hour equally divided for that purpose. 
The legislation before this body today is one of the most important proposals we will consider this year. S. 1186 proposes a streamlined, practical, business-oriented approach to job training which empowers States with the ability to transform the current patchwork of programs into a comprehensive system. The purpose of this bill is to better coordinate and to consolidate in certain circumstances 90 federally funded programs and promote joint partnerships between education leaders in the business community in developing a workforce development system that is first rate. 
Perhaps the best illustration of why we need to revamp our workforce system can be clearly seen on a weekly basis in the want-ad sections of the newspapers throughout the Nation. There are presently 190,000 unfilled positions in the technology field. The reason for the difficulty in filling these positions is not because of low unemployment numbers but because of the lack of skilled workers. Many of these jobs do not require 4 years plus postsecondary education. In fact, if we had the proper high school vocational education system, these could be filled by students graduating from high school. They require an excellent vocational education system and the ability to pursue technical education following high school graduation or receive this education as high school students. 
One of the most fascinating facts to come out of the Senate Labor Committee's hearings on the workforce is that Malaysia has replicated our tech-prep model. In other words, we have presently a model system with a few schools using it which, if duplicated throughout this country, could provide us with what we need today. The unusual thing is that in this country it takes us a long time to replicate anything through our school systems. Malaysia came over here, studied our Tech-Prep Program, and went back to Malaysia and implemented it overnight--again, moving them into a position to improve their competitiveness and perhaps exceed our own competitiveness. 
That is the kind of challenge we have now had delivered to us by our competitors in the international markets. It is up to us to take the steps necessary to ensure that we can meet the international competition which we are facing and not have 190,000 jobs out there begging because we cannot provide the skilled workforce. 
Fifteen years ago, `A Nation At Risk' was published and warned us about this problem. This report posed the question as to whether the United States would have an adequately trained workforce to meet the global challenges of the 21st century. Fifteen years later, here is what we have. According to the latest census information, 22 percent of the population in the United States aged 25 and over have completed less than 12 years of schooling. These are the kinds of problems with which we are faced. A most recent national adult literacy survey indicated that 44 million adults have literacy difficulty. This means that over 20 percent of adults in this country have trouble using reading, writing, and computation skills to say nothing of qualifying for jobs that are available, for which we should have the workforce. The same is true in my State of Vermont. All States have this very serious problem. 
With the statistics I just mentioned, the United States is still the most productive country in the world, but we are losing our edge to other industrialized nations such as Japan and Germany 
as well as other rapidly developing countries such as Taiwan, Korea, and China. Recent international exams have demonstrated that notwithstanding this warning we had 15 years ago, we have not made significant headway in being able to meet the challenge of that competition and to provide the workforce for those 190,000 jobs that are going begging right now. 
Over the past 25 years, the standard of living for those Americans without a 4-year postsecondary degree has plunged. In the next decade, we are in danger of being surpassed as the world's foremost economic power if we do not begin to redefine our priorities at the national, State, and local levels. 
This is an excellent bill, Mr. President. Senator DeWine, my good friend from Ohio, who was in charge of the subcommittee that developed this bill, along with Senator Wellstone, has produced a wonderful bill. It is going to do a great deal to bring us forward as we face the problems of the Nation and the problems of our national competitiveness. 
Mr. President, at this point I will be happy to yield the floor. Senator Wellstone, I believe, desires to be heard.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, let me just make a few more comments. I believe Senator DeWine will be here shortly. As was pointed out, there are three bills which are combined in this bill, and I want to talk a little bit about vocational rehabilitation. 
It is extremely important that as we move forward, we do more and more for our disabled community to give them every possible opportunity to compete for jobs and to demonstrate their capacity to help our Nation's workforce. We place these programs together, although we maintain separate streams of funding to ensure that each of these programs in adult education, vocational education, job training, and vocational rehabilitation will not feel at all threatened that money will be taken from them. 
It is important at the same time that we recognize the great capacity of people with disabilities to come into the workforce if they are given the opportunity. By placing them in the same bill, it is important to demonstrate that they are ready and willing to take advantage of the opportunities in the workforce in many places which they have been denied. 
Also, as I mentioned earlier in my statement, the problems we have with the adult workforce is literacy, to a large extent. As the demands become higher and greater on our workforce, we are recognizing that we need more people to move into the workforce to take the jobs that are available. Thus, it is incredibly important that we coordinate adult education along with vocational education. 
That is the purpose of this bill, to get everybody to work together to improve the workforce of this Nation to meet the competition of nations overseas. While I am pleased with the progress we have made, I believe that we have moved forward on this bill to do everything possible we can to make ourselves more competitive. 
I will now talk a little bit about a report released by the National Center for Research and Vocational Education which gave a good overview of training in European nations. I think it is important that my colleagues understand the kind of competition we are getting in Europe, and I will say the same is true and maybe even more so in Asia. 
This report highlights the importance of a cohesive partnership between educators and employers. Employers in Europe are active participants in the governance of work-related education and training in Australia, Great Britain, France and Germany. 
Another significant finding of the report is that European nations, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, are attempting to develop a technical education system which can survive as either a bridge to additional vocational training or pursuing college-level courses. 
Although we are not Europe, we are beginning to make some progress. With the passage of S. 1186, that progress will only continue to grow. 
I am also hopeful that passage of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act will eliminate many of the misconceptions that 
exist regarding vocational education, adult education and training. Some perceive vocational education as a second-rate education for students who cannot otherwise succeed in the so-called traditional academic path. Nothing--and I say nothing--could be further from the truth. In fact, the opposite in many cases is the situation now. 
Vocational education courses hold appeal for all students. In my home State of Vermont, over 4,500 students participate in vocational education courses of which 12 percent are adults. A strong technical education system is the best kind of training. As has been pointed out, as we move forward in our lives, the need for vocational education or skills training is going to increase. We are going to change jobs five, six, seven times during our lives as we move into the next century, and we are going to need training continuously. 
The same is true now with our society. However, we just do not have the appropriate training available. We need to coordinate, we need to get together and figure out how we can provide the skills that are necessary. 
If employment and training programs are to succeed, a simple, integrated workforce development system must be established that gives States, local communities, employers and students both the assistance and the incentives to participate in our global economy. S. 1186 is a good step in responding to this need. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. 
Before turning to others who may want to speak on this legislation, I again thank my colleagues and coauthors of the bill, in particular Senators Kennedy, DeWine and Wellstone. In particular, I thank the Employment and Training Subcommittee chaired by Senator DeWine, who has done an outstanding job in putting together this bill. Senator Wellstone, the Employment and Training Subcommittee ranking member, has also done a tremendous job in drafting key provisions of this bill. Senator Kennedy and I have been working for many years on this effort, and we are pleased to have Senators DeWine and Wellstone as our partners. 
I also thank the staff of Senators Wellstone, Kennedy and DeWine, and the staff of the Congressional Research Service and legislative counsel have worked tirelessly on this bill. 
In addition, I also thank the administration for their hard work. The business community led by the National Alliance for Business, the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers are also to be commended for their efforts and for their support. 
I express my appreciation to the Chief State School Officers and other educational organizations who offered constructive comments during the drafting of S. 1186. 
Most of all, I thank my home State of Vermont for serving as an inspiration for this legislation. Almost 1 year ago, I held a hearing in Vermont on workforce development. Over 100 Vermonters attended and offered various perspectives which have been incorporated in this bill. 
Also, I thank the State of Mississippi. I went down to the State of Mississippi and found that they had one of the most innovative vocational education systems that I have had the chance to observe. They are dedicated there and doing a fine job. 
In fact, I noted that their unemployment rate was going down, even though they were losing hundreds of jobs to Mexico. Why? Because of the business community seeing the state of their vocational training and their ability to train for the skills necessary for the jobs that are locating in Mississippi. Thus, they are losing low-wage jobs and replacing them with high-wage jobs. We have, therefore, taken a close look at the Mississippi system and have made sure our bill models their initiative. 
So I commend those in other States and certainly my own State of Vermont which I mentioned, who have tried to make efforts but they have been hindered to a certain extent by the problems with our present system, the inability to coordinate. 
This bill is designed to try and provide that coordination, to ensure that all of this country can move now to make sure that we are ready for the future. We established the goals to make sure by the next century we would have moved past our educational difficulties to the greatest extent possible, to make sure that our young people would be ready to enter the workforce, to make sure we provided them the skills not after high school but in high school, as well as to make sure this Nation would be competitive in the year ahead. 
I yield to my good friend, Senator DeWine, who deserves maximum credit from our side for his productive work in giving us a bill today which we can be proud of, which we can vote for with great confidence. We will improve this Nation's workforce. 
I yield to Senator DeWine.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill that my colleague Senator Baucus and I are introducing titled the, `Community And Postal Participation Act of 1998' (CAPPA). 
Coming from a small town in Vermont, I understand the importance downtowns or village centers play in the identity and longevity of a community. Downtowns are where people go to socialize, shop, learn what their elected representatives are doing, and gather to celebrate holidays with their neighbors. 
One of the focal points of any downtown area is the community's post office. Post offices have been part of downtowns and village centers as long as most cities and towns have existed. These post offices are often located in historic buildings and have provided towns with a sense of continuity as their communities have changed over time. The removal of this focal point can quickly lead to the disappearance of continuity and spirit of a community and then the community itself. 
Mr. President, this legislation will enable the inhabitants of small villages and large towns to have a say when the Postal Service decides that their local post office will be closed, relocated, or consolidated. Some of my colleagues may ask why this legislation is necessary. A few stories from my home state of Vermont will answer this question and hopefully lead to quick passage of this important legislation. 
A few years ago the general store on the green in Perkinsville, Vermont went bankrupt and the adjacent post office wanted to leave the small village center for a new building outside of town. By the time the community was aware of the project, plans were so far along--the new building had actually been constructed based on the promise of the post office as the anchor tenant--that there was no time to fully investigate in-town alternatives. One elderly resident wrote that in contrast to families now being able to walk to the post office, `we certainly won't be walking along the busy Route 106 two miles or more to get our mail.' The State Historic Preservation Officer commented that as people meet neighbors at the post office, the threads of community are woven and reinforced. `It may be intangible, but its real, and such interaction is critically important to the preservation of the spirit and physical fabric of small village centers like Perkinsville.' 
In 1988, the post office in the Stockbridge Vermont General Store needed to expand. The store owner tried to find money to rehabilitate an 1811 barn next to the store to provide the needed space, but was not successful. In 1990, the post office moved into a new facility located on the outskirts of Stockbridge on a previously undeveloped section of land at the intersection of two highways. People can no longer walk to the 
post office as they once were able to do when it was located in the village center. The relocation of the Stockbridge post office unfortunately removed one of the anchors of the community. 
These are not isolated examples. I ask unanimous consent that a description of Postal Service activities related to the relocation of post offices in the Vermont towns of Fairfax, Ascutney, Taftsville, and Huntington be included for the Record.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, post office relocations are not only occurring in Vermont, but all across the country. My colleagues will quickly discover similar examples in their own states where the removal of the post office has harmed the economic vitality of the downtown area, deprived citizens without cars of access, and contributed to urban sprawl. 
The basic premise for this legislation is to give the individuals in a community a voice in the process of a proposed relocation, closing or consolidation of a post office. This community voice has been lacking in the current process. This bill does not give the citizenry the ultimate veto power over a relocation, closing or consolidation. Instead, the bill sets up a process that makes sure community voices and concerns are heard and taken into account by the Postal Service. 
Additionally, this act will require the Postal Service to abide by local zoning laws and the historic preservation rules regarding federal buildings. Because it is a federal entity, the Postal Service has the ability to override local zoning requirements. In some cases this has lead to disruption of traffic patterns, a rejection of local safety standards, and concerns about environmental damage from problems such as storm water management. 
Mr. President, post offices in Vermont and across the nation are centers of social and business interaction. In communities where post offices are located on village greens or in downtowns, they become integral to these communities' identities. I believe that this legislation will strengthen the federal-local ties of the Postal Service, help preserve our downtowns, and combat the problem of sprawl. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and I in support of this important legislation.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Daniel Smith, for his unyielding support for and commitment to the Northeast Dairy Compact. With the help of Dan Smith the Dairy Compact has become an instrument of balance that is critical to the needs of both farmers and consumers in the New England region, as well as a model of success for the rest of the country. 
A carpenter by trade, Dan Smith, for more than ten years unselfishly committed himself to the crafting and building of the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission. Dan's dedication to the survival of New England's small farms and his desire to finish the job has benefited all those who value the strong agricultural communities in New England. With a bachelors degree from Dartmouth College and a law degree from the University of Wisconsin, Dan served as law clerk to the Honorable Frederic W. Allen, Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. As legal counsel for the Vermont State Legislature, Dan carefully drafted the Dairy Compact legislation. He then worked as Executive Director for Dairy Compact Committee, nurturing the Compact legislation through each of the six New England state legislatures, resulting in overwhelming support in each of the states. After six years of traveling throughout New England educating legislatures and building support for the Compact, Dan turned his efforts to Washington, D.C. and to the ratification of the Northeast Dairy Compact by the U.S. Congress. 
Mr. President, few initiatives in my memory have sparked such a vigorous policy debate as the Dairy Compact. Dan worked closely with me and my staff to develop and execute the many strategies that helped pass the Compact. The passage of the Compact was a long shot in the minds of many, but I knew that with Dan Smith's commitment we would succeed. I am proud to have sponsored the Compact on behalf of all my colleagues from the New England delegation. Adoption of the Compact could not have happened in Congress without the help of Dan Smith, and without the years of dedicated work from a veritable army of Compact supporters throughout New England. 
This tribute reflects that with the success of the Dairy Compact we recognize the commitment to and importance of our dairy farmers. The Dairy Compact holds great promise for the New England region to preserve the viability of agriculture and to protect a special way of life

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the week of May 4, 1998 is Public Service Recognition Week. It is a time to applaud the tremendous efforts and accomplishments of government employees, and to educate the public about the far reaching capabilities and services provided by government employees. It is also a time for public servants to remind ourselves why we chose to serve society through careers in public service. 
This year's theme is `Working for You, Working for America', highlighting the commitment of public employees to work for the benefit of each individual, and for the collective benefit to improve the quality of life across our great nation. 
In Vermont, over 6,000 members of our workforce are federal employees. We provide technical assistance to farmers, respond to disasters, manage forest land, and deliver mail. We administer federal funds to provide educational benefits, housing assistance, job training, and school breakfast and lunch programs. We process social security survivors benefits, veterans compensation, and small business loans. We are the faces of government--caseworkers, nurses, administrators, law enforcement officers. Day to day, our jobs are rarely front page news. We are on the front line and behind the scenes, working hard to resolve problems and make systems more effective. 
Yet during this one week of the year, we hope to let people know how we touch their lives. We'd like the media to highlight the successes: thousands of tax refunds processed on time, hundreds of packages delivered the night before Christmas, dozens of checks issued for crop assistance after a spring flood, thousands of affordable housing units for the elderly and disabled, and upkeep of a hiking trail from one end of the state to the other providing unparalleled vistas. 
Federal employees tout years of experience and commitment, investing themselves to bring about positive change. Continuously striving to be more efficient, more effective and more customer-service oriented, public servants care, and know government has a role to empower citizens to make life better. Federal employees contribute to our one-of-a-kind democracy. I rise to salute Vermont's federal employees . . . you truly make a difference.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I had hoped to be in Burlington, VT, this morning meeting with a group of high school students. They have been studying tobacco use among adults and teens and talking about the proposed tobacco settlement in their health and civics classes. I regret that I am not able to be in Vermont to talk with them. 
But I do want to take this opportunity to express my support for prompt consideration of tobacco legislation. When I look around the classrooms here in D.C. with students here in D.C: when I read in the Brent School, or when I meet students at home, as I had planned to today--I see dozens of faces alive with potential. I see those kids as the soccer and track stars. I wonder which ones enjoy science and which ones are the budding artists. To me, each of these kids represents an unknown but a promising future. 
To the tobacco industry, every single one of these kids represents nothing more than a replacement smoker. The tobacco industry's goal is to turn each of these young athletes and budding scientists into a smoker. We know now that the tobacco industry has plotted to capture the cub scout and the kindergarten market. 
We have documentation that the tobacco industry has studied the behavior of children as young as 5 to determine how susceptible they are. And their scheming has worked. Every day, every week of every year, 3,000 children become addicted to cigarettes. A third of them will die early from smoking, and those who go on to raise families will endanger their children through low birthweight complications and secondhand smoke. 
Vermont and other States have done much to combat teen smoking. I applaud the parents, teachers, and State health officials who have led the battle against big tobacco at the local level. It is time now for Congress to do something too. 
Ever since the Attorneys General announced their proposed settlement last June, Congress has been talking to experts and debating the best approach to reduce teen smoking. But the time for talking is behind us. And time is running out. It is critical that the Senate act on tobacco legislation in the coming weeks. We cannot allow politics to stand in the way of this rare opportunity. This issue is too important and too complicated to leave to the last minute. 
As chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have held seven hearings on the question of what tobacco policy would be best for this country. We heard from the experts that there is no silver bullet that will solve the problem of teen smoking. But that is no excuse for inactivity. Smoking kills 400,000 people a year, and it is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Nine out of ten smokers became addicted as teenagers. 
My home State of Vermont, unfortunately, is not immune from the problem. Our teen smoking rate is higher--higher--than the national average. More than one in every three Vermont high school students are regular smokers. More than 12,000 Vermont teens currently under age 18 will die prematurely from tobacco-related disease. That is like wiping the towns of Underhill, Jericho, Richmond, and Huntington right off the map--wiping them right off the map. 
Despite the best efforts of parents, educators, and health professionals around the State over the past few years, more and more teenagers are deciding to smoke. Unless we act now to help them quit, most of these kids will continue to smoke into adulthood. 
I pledge to Vermonters that I will do everything I can to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation this year. In February, I introduced the Prevent Addiction To Smoking Among Teens Act, the PAST Act, to enact and improve upon the public health provisions of the tobacco settlement. Last month, the Senate Commerce Committee passed comprehensive legislation which incorporated many of the public health provisions originally proposed in the PAST Act. 
As tobacco legislation moves through the Senate, I will continue my fight to ensure that we keep our eyes on the goal of improving the public health and preventing kids from smoking. Congress needs to pass legislation which will prevent kids from smoking. Even though there is no silver bullet, we do know of many approaches which have proven effective, particularly when used in combination. 
A national tobacco policy must give the Food and Drug Administration full authority to regulate tobacco, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, and the State health departments, and others in the fight to convince high school students not to smoke, and to treat those who have decided to do so, as well as we can, to get them to stop. 
We need to make teen smoking a thing of the past. I cannot think of a better graduation present for high school seniors in Vermont and around the country than to stop teenage smoking. 
Mr. President, thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin consideration of S. 1186, the job training partnership bill, also known as the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This will be taken up under a previous consent agreement. That agreement allows for 4 hours of debate divided equally among several amendments to be offered to the job training bill. 
At the conclusion of the consideration of S. 1186, the Senate will begin a period of morning business, with Senator Coverdell controlling 1 hour and Senator Daschle or his designee controlling 1 hour. 
Members are reminded that no rollcall votes will occur during today's session, and any votes ordered with respect to the job training bill will be postponed, to occur at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, May 5. 
As a further reminder, on Monday, May 4, the Senate will begin consideration of the IRS reform bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor on Monday to debate and to offer amendments to this important piece of legislation. Once again, as with the job training bill, any votes ordered with respect to the IRS reform bill will be stacked, to occur at 5:30 on Tuesday. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, S. 1186. This legislation incorporates job training, vocational education, and adult education--three programs. Last year we passed welfare reform, which has no hope of success unless individuals have the appropriate education and training to compete in the workforce. 
We will never successfully reduce the welfare rolls unless we give people the tools to enter the workforce. Vocational education, adult education, and job training are how we give people those tools. This bill creates a system where all three of these key areas work together. 
Separate funding streams and administration are maintained. I repeat that. Separate funding streams and administration are maintained for each of these activities, in recognition that each activity serves a distinct function. At the same time, the important interrelationship among these activities has too often been ignored. Policy in each area has generally been considered in a vacuum, leading to disappointment and frustration to job seekers and employers alike. For this reason, Senator DeWine, Senator Kennedy, Senator Wellstone, and I have written legislation which will assist States in coordinating policies related to job training and training-related education. 
States that are moving forward in their workforce development efforts believe that all of the education and training players create an agenda which reflects an education and training partnership instead of having these two critical areas living individually, in solitary confinement. 
Senator Kennedy and I have been working on job training legislation for over 2 decades. I count the Job Training Partnership Act, which I coauthored along with Representative Hawkins and Senators Kennedy, Hatch, and Quayle, as a significant legislative accomplishment. 
Today, 16 years later, it is clear that the Job Training Partnership Act is not sufficient to meet the increasing demands made on our education and training system. This Nation has failed to implement strategies which will enable our workforce to meet the demands made by an ever changing international economy. 
Our international competitors have been leaders in making the important link between education and work. The United States is beginning to make some progress, although it is clearly not yet nationwide. 
I have seen examples of this progress in a few States, including my home State of Vermont. Vergennes Union High School has an excellent biotech program that was established through a partnership between the business community and the local school district. They were talking about things we hadn't even heard of a few years ago in their high school class. In addition, Essex Technical Center offers an array of programs that serve all students, ranging from at-risk youths to adults. 
Another State that is an exemplary leader in workforce development is Mississippi. Two years ago, I visited Mississippi and was overwhelmed by their academic, financial, and overall community commitment to revitalize their vocational education-tech prep system. This program is so successful that the Mississippi legislature passed an increase in their sales tax to expand that initiative. This has been very beneficial to the Mississippi economy. Businesses not only stay in Mississippi, but major companies are relocating to Mississippi, because of the skilled workforce that is in place because of these improvements. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act builds upon an excellent workforce development system that is evolving in Vermont, Mississippi, and in other States throughout the Nation. S. 1186 will enable States to have greater flexibility to promote coordination between vocational education, adult education, and training. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act gives States, local communities, and employers both the assistance and the incentives to train individuals--to train individuals for real jobs. 
The two key points of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act are the establishment of tough accountability measures and a rallying of the private and public sectors to implement an education and training delivery system that enables all members of our society to receive the education and training they need at any point in their lifetime--I repeat that, at any point in their lifetime. 
As I mentioned, accountability is a key feature of S. 1186. Those States that exceed their performance measures--the accountability mechanisms in all three titles--will be eligible for additional funding from the Department of Education and Labor, which can then be used for innovative activities related to the programs authorized under S. 1186. 
I believe this bill, which unanimously passed the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and has the support of the business community, including the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Alliance of Businesses, the Chamber of Commerce, and the administration, is one of the most important initiatives the Senate will consider this year. 
Year after year, report after report indicates that we do not have an adequately trained workforce. The following statistics illustrate this point: A Committee for Economic Development study estimates that each year's class of high school dropouts costs over $200 billion in lost incomes and taxes over the lifetimes of those students. I would like to note that my friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine, has done an outstanding job in this legislation in taking the lead on the youth provisions which will hopefully improve this very, very terrible statistic. 
American employers spend over $200 billion a year in remedial education and training for their employees--over $200 billion a year in remedial education and training for their employees. I point out that Europe spends about the same amount, but they spend it with their schools so that they don't have to wait an extra 2 years to be entering into the workforce. 
This Nation presently has 190,000 positions unfilled in the technology area because of a lack of skilled workers. Those skills could be taught, almost all of them, in the high schools, but kids have to wait until they get out of high school under the present system, although some schools, as I mentioned earlier, like Vergennes, are moving in that area to provide those skills which are reachable with the talents of our young people in high school rather than waiting to go to further skill training. 
The business community, Federal, State, and local governments must support education and training systems which allow all members of society to enter the training system and receive the education and training they need at any point in their lifetime, whether it be the high school student pursuing a biotech career, the adult who is desperate to trade a welfare check for a paycheck, the dislocated worker who needs to learn new skills to enhance his or her marketability, the vocational rehabilitation client who needs training assistance, or the incumbent worker who requires additional education and training to keep pace with the ever-evolving global economy. S. 1186 lays a foundation for achieving that goal. 
Before I turn to my colleagues, I would like to express my deep appreciation to Senators Kennedy, DeWine, and Wellstone and their staffs and also a special thank you to the Congressional Research Service and the Senate legislative counsel staff for all of their hard work in this bipartisan initiative. I thank each of them for their time and effort in getting S. 1186 to this point. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an amendment in the nature of a substitute and it is the work of the committee. So we have already really defined in our statement, Senator Kennedy and myself, the contents of that amendment. 
Mr. President, I emphasize that this was a committee piece of work, and what happened is amazing in a sense, if you understand my committee, which has probably the largest divergence and philosophical persuasion. We were able to sit down and work together and come up with a piece of legislation which passed the committee unanimously, and as I think things will develop, will show that we probably will get a similar consideration on the floor. 
I yield to Senator DeWine, after first commending him and also his cohort, Senator Wellstone, for the incredible amount of work they put in. Senator Kennedy and I are the leaders of the committee, but it is the subcommittee that really did the majority of the work here. I want to commend them for the tremendous capacity to work together. As I said, there is some divergence in the philosophical opinion between the two men. 
But it proved to be of great advantage to the whole body here by coming out with an excellent piece of work. I now yield the floor to Senator DeWine.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, almost 10 years ago, the wall that had divided Europe for more than a generation suddenly crumbled. Brave, freedom-loving people in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia took matters into their own hands, eventually toppling their communist governments. East Germans attacked their wall with gusto, and in a matter of months, Germany was reunited. Ever since that time, there has been talk in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary of joining the West in a more formal way, to solidify their break from the East, to recognize their conversion to democracy and free markets, and to insure against future aggression from the East. NATO membership was seen as one way to do this. Eastern Europe also recognized that economic development was critical to their success and sought economic integration with the West and access to its markets. Membership in the European Economic Union was a high priority for most states. 
While the West spoke glowingly of the transformations taking place in the East, it soon became clear that there would be only meager amounts of foreign assistance and economic investment for the East, and access to new markets would remain limited. Western Europe and North America were wrestling with their own economic difficulties and fighting popular expectations that the end of the Cold War would bring reduced financial commitments abroad. Increasingly, it became clear to many Eastern European governments that joining NATO was their best chance of getting membership in a western `club'. NATO membership would address the historical and emotional anxieties of many East Europeans left by decades of domination and oppression by the East, and would provide western aid to modernize their militaries. While it wasn't what they needed most, at least it was something. 
As the prospects of membership in the Economic Union faded, many East European governments jumped at the 1995 NATO announcement that it would consider taking in new members. NATO, led by the United States, was faced with the difficult task of deciding which countries would qualify for membership immediately and which ones would be refused, pending further political, economic and military maturation. The stakes were high, and in some cases, the disappointment was great. The United States made it clear to all who were not accepted that there would be other chances to join in the near future, that the door to membership would remain open. No clear vision of the shape or boundaries of NATO emerged from this exercise. 
The decision to enlarge NATO also altered the context for the newly formed Partnership for Peace (PFP). Rather than concentrating on the quality of PFP discussions and ways that it could enhance regional security, the focus shifted instead to the benefits of full NATO membership. Rather than easing the tensions caused by the Cold War dividing line through the heart of Europe, enlarging NATO revived those tensions, once again creating a sense of `us' versus `them', and reducing the ability of the PFP to address the void left by the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. 
Americans feel the strong emotional pull of the countries who want to join NATO. We want to do what we can to reward them for their struggles and solidify their political, social and economic gains. We have little ability to pry open European markets, and few financial resources to commit to economic development programs. So NATO membership at first glance seems the obvious thing to do. 
I have some very deep reservations about this course of action. For one, NATO membership will not provide what the new democracies of Eastern Europe need most--economic and political development. Secondly, NATO expansion may well jeopardize critical U.S. national security concerns that require close cooperation with Russia. Additionally, moving to expand NATO at this time cuts short the potential development of the PFP into a more innovative structure for handling the very diverse military concerns of its members who now span the globe from the Arctic Ocean to Central Asia to the Pacific Ocean. We also must recognize that estimates of the cost of NATO expansion vary widely, and it is likely that the American taxpayer will get stuck picking up a very sizable percentage of the costs. Finally, I do not believe that the American public has given sufficient attention to the question that is being asked of the Senate: Should we extend our very best security guarantee to more nations? Are we ready to commit US troops to the unconditional defense of even more territory? The Senate should not act until it is sure that the American people support this commitment. 
Now is not the time to make this move. Let's think for a moment about the most immediate threat facing both Europe and the United States. It is not really a Russian attack upon Eastern Europe. The war in Chechnya showed that the Russian military is not even capable of putting down internal rebellion. Yet this is what NATO is designed to protect against. 
A very real and pressing threat to U.S. and European security is the leakage of Russian weapons of mass destruction. An expanded NATO gives us no advantage in countering this threat, while at the same time cutting back on the degree of cooperation we will get out of Russia in addressing these threats. If we want to work with the Russian military, we must convince them that we are not escalating the threat against them. Much as we might say that NATO is not an aggressive alliance aimed at Russia, Cold War perceptions do not dissipate that quickly, and if Russia feels increasingly threatened, it will be even more reluctant to scale back its military capabilities, to ratify START II and to cooperate in other arms control initiatives. And these are things that matter very much to U.S. national security. 
We have increasingly found that the resolution of most thorny international crises require some assistance from Russia. The standoff with Saddam Hussein over UN weapons inspections was the most recent example. Bosnia will continue to demand active US-Russian cooperation, and other efforts such as reducing the spread of nuclear weapons in South Asia will be enhanced if we have Russian assistance. 
The decision to move NATO closer to the borders of Russia may well have one other unintended and dangerous consequence--driving Russia into a closer relationship with 
China. China will continue to emerge as a greater presence on the international scene. And I believe we will have even more serious disagreements with its leadership. Russia is a part of this strategic equation. Our job now is to convince Russia that it shares our concerns vis a vis China, and that it is not in Russia's best interest to turn a blind eye to dangerous Chinese behaviors. But it Russia feels that a closer relationship with the West will not bring it greater security, then this will be a very difficult argument to make. 
Mr. President, Senate ratification of this enlargement of NATO is just the first step. Other countries are now very anxious to get `in' and eventually more of them are going to meet the stated qualifications for membership. Yet every new addition beyond the three before us today brings more trouble, both in terms of Russian reaction and challenges to the cohesion of the NATO structure. If NATO is unable to act decisively on matters that we feel are central to our security, it will be of diminishing use to us in the future. 
I am quite concerned that by accepting these three countries today, we are increasing the pressure on others to join. Putting top priority on developing a close military relationship with NATO is not what these new democracies need right now. They should be focusing primarily on their economic, social and political development. I fear that we do them a disservice by holding up NATO membership as the best way to be `tied' to the West. After all, having a stable democracy and strong economic ties with one's neighbors has proven to be the most successful way to ward off both military and political strife. 
If we proceed to invite Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to join NATO, I believe we must be very cautious about any additional rounds. I have proposed an addition to the document before us that would require the Administration to report regularly to Congress on the status of discussions with other countries about joining NATO. Hopefully this will allow us to be more involved in the process before any new invitations are extended. I appreciate the Managers acceptance of my amendment. And I trust that the vigorous debate we have had on this issue will encourage much greater caution by the Administration and NATO in extending future invitations. 
I know some Senators objected earlier to efforts to postpone consideration of this treaty. Yet, no matter where my Colleagues come down on this issue, I trust they all now will agree with me that U.S. foreign policy and the American public have benefited from the fuller debate we have had as a result. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me say that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic deserve to be recognized for the great strides they have made in recent years. But I am not convinced that immediate full membership in NATO is the right answer for them or for us. And I am very concerned that the process this treaty sets in motion is one that we may well ultimately come to regret.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to retired U.S. Senator Bob T. Stafford. The Central Vermont-New Hampshire Valley Chapter of the American Red Cross is honoring Bob with its most prestigious award at a dinner to be held at the Capitol Plaza Hotel in Montpelier, Vermont on May 7, 1998. He will receive the Chapter's Volunteer of the Year Award, in recognition for his six years of service on the Board of Directors and his sterling leadership of the its capital campaign, `Building for the 21st Century.' 
Bob was elected to the Board of Directors in 1992, and has served on a number of committees, including financial development and the executive committees, as well as chair of the capital campaign committee. He led the last committee by identifying and acquiring major lead gift pledges for the $1 million campaign, initiated in 1997. 
Before joining the Red Cross Chapter's Board, he provided leadership for several significant disaster fund-raising campaigns, including the effort to raise funds to support recovery operations during the 1992 flood that ravaged downtown Montpelier. He was also honorary chair of several special events to raise funds to support the operating expenses of the Chapter. 
In addition to these honors, the Chapter is hosting the dinner as a celebration and recognition of the longtime service of the state of Vermont. Bob has served the state of Vermont as Attorney General, Lieutenant Governor, Governor, U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator. His name is now revered by college students throughout the country for his development and support of legislation creating student loans and his leadership in efforts to preserve the environment. His support of vocational education is memorialized in his home town of Rutland, where the Stafford Technical Center serves the needs of hundreds of Rutland County students. 
His name is also affixed to the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act, which allows various federal agencies to make preliminary advance preparations in response to disasters before their official declarations. 
I am pleased that my friend and former colleague is being recognized for this longstanding efforts in support of the community. Bob represents the best of Vermont and has set the example we should all strive to emulate.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Vermont's home health agencies are a model of efficiency for the nation. For the past seven consecutive years, the average Medicare expenditure for home health care in Vermont has been the lowest in the nation. This efficiency was achieved by exclusive reliance on 13 nonprofit agencies which provide care without sacrificing quality, and which adhere strictly to Medicare requirements and guidelines. Today, I am cosponsoring The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998, with my good friend Senator Collins, in order to preserve this high-quality, low-cost home health system from possible insolvency. 
At this moment, Vermont is facing an unprecedented crisis in its home health care system. This is not a crisis of their own making, and the home health agencies had little, if any, advance warning that disaster was imminent. The crisis that befalls Vermont's home health care agencies, and many others throughout the country, arose from the decision made by Congress, as a part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), to adopt a Medicare prospective payment system for home health care. 
There is compelling rationale and general agreement for moving Medicare to a prospective payment system (PPS) in the home health care sector. Under a national, prospective payment system, low-cost agencies will fare well, as they have already learned how to manage their resources wisely. However, the interim system created by the BBA for the transition to a PPS is fundamentally flawed and rewards high-cost agencies. Under the Interim Payment System, reimbursement limits for home health care are heavily weighted toward an agency's historical costs. This means that until a prospective payment system can be designed and implemented, the lowest cost agencies will face the most significant caps on their Medicare payments. 
Where a prospective payment system aims to level the playing field for agencies that care for similarly situated patients, the interim system preserves and reinforces significant disparities across agencies. Although high-cost agencies will face reductions in payments under the interim system, these will be the agencies in the best position to make those cuts. Low-cost agencies with budgets that are already lean have no place to turn. It would be a national tragedy if those low-cost agencies cannot survive the transition to a prospective system. 
I commend the efforts of my good friend Senator Collins for bringing this bill forward. it was a difficult task to craft a remedy that allows committed and responsible home health agencies to survive and also maintain budget neutrality. The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 would alter the interim payment formula by basing payment caps on a blend of national and regional averages. In this way, we can move toward a more uniform level of reimbursement and allow home health care agencies in the same locale to operate under the same constraints. Furthermore, this legislation can be implemented quickly. This is important, because the regulations defining the interim payment system were not published until January of this year--nearly four months after the payment system was in force. 
The situation is serious. We must provide relief to home health agencies and peace of mind to the clients who are under their care. Last August, I voted in support of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I was proud of the changes we made to preserve Medicare benefits for the present and for future generations. Today, I urge my colleagues to enact The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 and correct the unintended consequences of the BBA's interim payment system reimbursement limits on low-cost home health agencies.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today, April 23, as the United States Congress joins hands with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and conducts a Day of Remembrance ceremony in the Rotunda of the Capitol. This ceremony, and those in each of the 50 State capitols and in some 200 cities and towns throughout the nation, honors the memory of those 11 plus million Holocaust victims and the millions more who survived but found their pre-WWII lives in shambles and in all too many cases, irretrievable. 
This year's ceremony pays special tribute to the children, those innocent victims of the war and the Nazis' persecution. That they survived is remarkable. In some instances, they bear the physical markings of their plight. Others carry their wounds in their hearts and heads. 
That this great nation mandates a Day of Remembrance ceremony is an indication of its commitment to historical memory. But an equally important part of our effort to learn from the past is the presence of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Its mission is to advance Holocaust memory, education and scholarship. This week marks its 5th anniversary. 
Five years ago, no one would have predicted the reaction of the United States to the opening of the Holocaust Museum. Estimates of visitation, even those most rosy, were low by a factor of more than two. Expecting 750,000 visitors under the highest estimate, the museum welcomed over 2 million in its first year and every year since. Just drive by the Holocaust Museum any morning and see the line stretching around the building. 
While I reflect on the Holocaust Museum, I feel it appropriate to mention the work of a distinguished Vermonter, Professor Raul Hilberg. Professor Hilberg spent many years educating students at the University of Vermont about the Holocaust, but few people know how instrumental he was in furthering Holocaust related research as a real serious enterprise. It wasn't until Raul Hilberg began his study of this important subject that historians began to take it seriously, and his research preceded the concept of the Holocaust Memorial Museum. Professor Hilberg was instrumental in furthering the Museum's research programs and many feel that he serves as a father figure to the institution. 
Americans care about the past and want the world they leave to their children to be a better and safer place. They have learned well the lessons from the fall of German democracy and the rise of Nazism. They look around the world today and see acts of genocide and crimes against humanity and rightly worry about our future. 
They come to the Holocaust Museum because it informs and educates. It makes disregarding the past and even contemporary acts of genocide and crimes against humanity more difficult. 
We as a nation benefit greatly from this institution which stands as a testament to the horrors of the past and guards against a reoccurrence in the future.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am submitting an amendment to the resolution to ratify the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). This amendment addresses future new membership in the alliance. 
28 countries in central Asia and eastern Europe that have applied for NATO membership or may aspire to join at a future date when they can meet NATO criteria. Today we are considering extending the NATO security umbrella to only three countries--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. It is important that we have a clear understanding that the expansion process may go much further than this initial round. 
In January 1994, the Administration adopted the Partnership for Peace program to provide a framework for NATO's evaluation of states that are considered to be candidates for alliance membership. In addition to the first three countries invited to join NATO, nine other Partnership for Peace countries have begun the formal application process for membership--Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia. Moreover, another 15 countries have expressed an interest in NATO by joining the Partnership for Peace. These countries include Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Finland, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgystan, Moldova, Russia, Switzerland, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Although not associated with Partnership for Peace, Croatia has expressed hope that they too will be admitted some day. 
The extensive territory covered by these NATO hopefuls begs for more information on the nature and mission of the alliance in the future. My amendment would require an annual report to the Senate on United States Government discussions with the governments of each of these countries on their possible accession. The reports would include the expected timetable for those countries to meet the criteria for NATO membership and how the Administration believes the functioning of NATO would be altered if they were to become a member. 
Just how far are we willing to extend the NATO alliance? I am not questioning whether Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic deserve to become alliance members. All three have made remarkable gains since the end of the Cold War. But in the future, other of these 25 nations will meet the criteria to join NATO and may be no less deserving of membership. Now is the time for the Senate to begin thinking about the long-term indications of a decision to open NATOs doors to the East.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we just finished a vote on the controversial Moseley-Braun amendment related to school construction. There is no question about the tremendous school 
infrastructure needs throughout this Nation. Well over $180 billion are necessary to bring the schools up to some appropriate standard. 
However, as was very aptly pointed out, and no doubt was one reason that the amendment was defeated, it is States that have the primary responsibility for that construction. It is not a constitutional responsibility of this body. 
I just bring to the attention of the body a chart that was discussed earlier today. Quoting the words of the Clinton administration: 
The construction and renovation of school facilities has traditionally been the responsibility of state and local governments, financed primarily by local taxpayers. We are opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant program for school construction. 
I want people to keep that in mind when they consider what I have to say. 
Under the Constitution, the District of Columbia, the Capital of the United States, is, in the view of Congress, at least in the writings, are our responsibility as a state legislature is to a State. We, the Members of the Congress of the United States, are responsible for the infrastructure of this city and its school system. And we should be ashamed of our negligence in that regard. The neglect did not occur over a few years; it has occurred over decades. 
So, the deficit in the school infrastructure is the responsibility of all of those who have been in power, whether it was the local governments to whom we gave the power in the 1970s and 1980s or whether it was the Congress that was in power before that. Everyone has neglected the school infrastructure. There is no question that the Nation's Capital, for which Congress is responsible, has one of the worst school infrastructures in the Nation. 
Again, this fall, the DC schools did not open on time. How that happened is another story that could be discussed some other time. But the bottom line is that it was because of the dilapidated conditions of the schools. The students marched to make us all aware of what was happening. 
I now show you a chart that appeared as a photograph in the Washington Post on Wednesday, October 8th, in which the students say, `Why should students suffer for adult incompetence?' It should be `For congressional incompetence,' because we are responsible for those schools being closed. The question is, what should we do about it? 
I voted against the Moseley-Braun amendment because I felt that that money, which would be more than adequate to fix up the D.C. schools, should be utilized for that purpose. I am not pushing this issue right now for this reason: Last year, I raised the issue of funding the construction of the DC public schools to bring them up to standard. I almost got $1 billion in the Finance Committee. That effort failed by one vote. We did end up with $50 million coming out of the Senate. But in the reconciliation bill, even the $50 million was dropped. 
Why? Because it was said that there were better programs to be financed by the Federal Government to help the District of Columbia than to help the school system. I violently disagree with that. At the same time, the Director of OMB said that he would work with me this year to find the money for the schools, as did other members of the Finance Committee. The members of the conference committee also said that they would help. Thus I have formed a working group with the OMB Director, Frank Raines, and other Members of both the House and the Senate, and we will be working over the next month or two to be able to try to find out what we can do to make sure that these schools get brought up to proper standards. 
Congress is not meeting its obligation. The infrastructure repair requirements--just to bring schools up to modern standards--is $2 billion. That is with a `b,' $2 billion, to give the students in this city the necessary funds to fix up the schools. The District is the size of a small State--population-wise, about the size of Vermont. That we are not able to help these kids is a travesty. There is no excuse for that. 
Also, if you want to look at the DC schools compared to the rest of the country, we have a chart. The red bar is where D.C. is on critical areas in need of repairs, and the yellow is the national average. 
The national total is $180 billion necessary to bring schools up to proper standards--not very good. But if you compare the national average with the D.C. schools, my God, look at that. Exterior walls and windows, 72 percent of DC schools are inadequate. The national average is 27 percent. Sixty-seven percent of the roofs on the schools in this city are in bad need of repair, 65 percent of the heating and ventilation needs repair, and 65 percent of the plumbing needs repair. Electrical lighting, 53 percent. That is just not acceptable. We should be ashamed. 
It is our responsibility to make sure that those repairs are made. However, not only have we not done that, but in 1974 when we created home rule, we prohibited the District from raising its own money from the most likely source to repair its schools. How did we do that? Well, the Senators from Virginia and Maryland very cleverly put a provision in the act that says the District cannot tax the income of nonresident workers. Every State in the Union that has a tax on income, taxes the income of nonresidents. 
Every city in a multistate area that has an income tax also taxes the income of nonresidents. So in prohibiting a commuter tax in DC, we have precluded District residents from generating the revenues to improve the physical infrastructure of the schools. The District has to have a revenue stream to be able to raise the bonds in order to pay for the school repairs. 
We in Congress have the responsibility to repair the schools, and we have prevented the local government from raising the money using the most logical source to fix those schools. 
What must we do? We have a number of options. I first point out that the closing of the schools this past fall demonstrates the necessity of funding the school repairs. In this regard, I want to clear up something for the record. A lot of blame has been heaped on General Becton, the school superintendent. Actually, what happened was that the citizen's group, Parents United, brought a lawsuit to ensure proper repairs while some repairs were already in process of being made. The work was planned so the schools wouldn't have to be closed, but the judge, who got fed up with city's inability to repair the schools, said, `No, you are not going to open the schools until you complete the repairs.' This then created a panic, because the school administrators had to search all of a sudden to find contractors to get the schools fixed to then get the schools re-opened. That process, as a subsequent GAO analysis showed, ended up adding expense to the renovation process. 
It is important for us to recognize that before we go home this year, before we fix schools in other areas, it is our responsibility to fix the schools of this city. We are constitutionally responsible. I am hopeful that in the days ahead, when our DC schools working group meets, our task will be to figure out how Congress is going to find the necessary $2 billion in the years ahead, either through some revenue stream created for the District or by utilization of Federal funds. We have to do that. We cannot allow this travesty to continue for the young people of D.C. when we have a constitutional responsibility to fix their schools. 
I am hopeful that as we go forward, we will be able to work together, both sides of the aisle, to find a solution to this inexcusable travesty for the young people of Washington. 
I want to make sure that my colleagues understand that what I have said is valid. First, we have a letter from Dr. Brimmer, the head of the control board, which indicates that it is impossible to create a revenue stream for the DC schools under the present fiscal situation of the city, nor does the school district have the authority to create a dedicated revenue source. Therefore, it would be necessary for Congress to do something to acquire the necessary money for construction and repairs of the school system.

Mr. JEFFORDS. In addition, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the testimony of Professor Raskin from hearings I held in January. It addresses the constitutionality of Congress' responsibility for those schools. As a constitutional scholar, his testimony justifies what I think has become obvious from the debate, that the Congress has a responsibility to provide for the D.C. schools infrastructure.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Also, for those who have additional interest in this issue, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of all the States that have an income tax and whether or not those states tax the income of nonresidents. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed a list with similar information about cities that impose taxes on nonresidents. It shows that every city in a multistate area that has an income tax also taxes the income of nonresidents. 
Somebody may point out that Baltimore does not, but Baltimore, as you know, is flanked on two sides by water and on two other sides by the State of Maryland. It cannot therefore be construed as a city in a multistate area.

Mr. JEFFORDS. 
Mr. President, today, I join with my good friend Senator Christopher Dodd, in announcing the introduction of the Health Care Personal Information Nondisclosure Act of 1998--The Health Care PIN Act. This legislation will establish necessary national standards to protect the confidentiality of each American's medical records. 
Information technology presents our nation with the difficult challenge of ensuring that we reap its benefits without sacrificing one of our most important values: the right to individual privacy. In order to maintain control over our personal medical information, Congress must pass health care confidentiality legislation--as quickly as possible. 
The time is ripe for action. There have been major technological advances in health care's administrative, delivery, and payment systems. These advances have the potential to improve the quality of patient care. For example, electronic pharmaceutical records make it possible for pharmacists to identify potential drug interactions before filling a prescription. However, we must also have guarantees that our personal health care information is not being used inappropriately. 
Congress has made repeated attempts to enact a comprehensive federal privacy law but has, to date, been unsuccessful. The loose web of protections at the federal and state levels that has evolved in the absence of a comprehensive law leaves many aspects of health information unprotected. 
The Health Care PIN Act represents a synthesis of recommendations from many sources. It draws heavily from the discussion draft that I worked on with Senator Bennett and the `Medical Information Privacy and Security Act,' introduced by Senator Leahy and Senator Kennedy. The Labor and Human Resources Committee has held three hearings on the confidentiality of health care information, and the testimony and comments provided at each of those hearings has been invaluable--especially, the administration's recommendations presented by Secretary Shalala in September. 
Under the terms of the Kassebaum/Kennedy legislation, if Congress fails to enact federal privacy legislation by August 1999, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to promulgate regulations establishing electronic privacy standards in the year 2000. This is too important a matter of public policy to be done outside of the legislative process and it is another reason why I intend to make this task one of the highest priorities of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
Other nations have taken steps to protect patient privacy. In 1995, the European Union enacted the Data Privacy Directive. The EU Directive requires that individuals have rights of consent, access, correction, and remedies for failure to protect confidential personal information. This Directive requires that by October 1998, if countries trading with any of the 15 European Union member states do not introduce similar rules, data cannot be transmitted between these countries. If we do not act promptly, this initiative raises the concern that the European Union could limit the flow of health care data between our countries for research and restrict the ability of American companies to compete overseas. 
The Health Care PIN Act would preempt state laws relating to medical records confidentiality--with the important exception of public health issues and those areas having a history of discrimination, such as mental health and HIV-AIDS. Since most health plans exchange health care information over the borders of many states, we need one privacy standard in this county--rather than 50 different ones--in order to achieve the greatest benefits from information technology and also ensure that all Americans have a uniform standard of privacy protection. 
The Act requires that individually identifiable health care information not be released unless authorized by patient consent. With very few exceptions, individually identifiable health care information should be disclosed for health purposes only, which includes the provision and payment of care and plan operations. Under the legislation, patients would have the right to copy and correct their medical records. In order to achieve accountability, the Health Care PIN Act provides that civil and criminal penalties would be imposed on individuals who use information improperly through unauthorized disclosure. 
Our individual right to privacy at times must be balanced against the need to protect the health of others. The Health Care PIN Act allows for the disclosure of health information without patient consent for the release of information to public health authorities for disease reporting. In addition, patient consent would not be required to disclose information needed for legitimate law enforcement purposes, including purposes required by state law such as the reporting of gunshot victims. Quality care requires more than the free flow of information between providers, payers, and other users of health information. It requires trust between a patient and a care giver. For our health care system to be effective, as well as efficient, patients must feel comfortable sharing sensitive information with health professionals. Technology has provided the tools to allow the ease of access to health care information. Now, the Health Care PIN Act is needed to ensure the confidentiality of this personal health information. 
It is my intent to work closely with the other members of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and Senators Bennett and Leahy, to enact legislation this year that will establish national standards to protect medical information and enhance quality of health care for all Americans.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride and enthusiasm to submit a Senate Resolution Commemorating the 20th Anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Veterans of America. This resolution has the cosponsorship of Senator Specter, Senator Akaka and Senator Leahy. The resolution also points out that April marks the 18th Anniversary of the founding of Vietnam Veterans of America's first local chapter in my home town of Rutland, Vermont. 
Mr. President, the VVA is a Congressionally chartered national veterans service organization exclusively dedicated to Vietnam-era veterans and their families. In the late 1970s, America had come through its longest and most divisive war. Many of the millions of veterans who served during that period felt that their concerns were not being addressed by the veterans community and by the federal government. 
In January, 1978, Bobby Muller and a small band of Vietnam veterans came to Washington, D.C. to create an advocacy organization to push for federal action to address the needs of this unique veteran population. The VVA, initially known as the Vietnam Veterans Coalition and then the Council of Vietnam Veterans, went to work focusing first on the dissemination of government information and coordination of relations between the federal government and the veteran. 
In time it became clear that, like many other organizations, this one could not survive simply by making a good case for its initiatives--it needed to build a strong membership base in order to wield political power. By the summer of 1979, the new Vietnam Veterans of America began to focus on building its membership. 
The growth of the organization was slow initially, but a breakthrough came following resolution of the American Hostage Crisis in Iran in January, 1981. It became clear to many Americans that if the hostages deserved a jubilant homecoming, so did the veterans of Vietnam. Vietnam veterans began to clamor for action in the form of programs that would place the last generation of wartime veterans on the same footing as veterans from previous wars. 
The strength of the organization grew with the increase in membership. The public also became more willing to deal with the neglected veterans issues unique to the Vietnam war. This culminated in the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in November, 1982. The activities around the Memorial rekindled a sense of camaraderie among the veterans and the feeling of a shared experience too significant to ignore. 
Since then, the VVA has made great strides in the kinds of services it provides to its membership, including the founding of the Vietnam Veterans of America Legal Services that provides assistance to veterans seeking benefits and services from the government. VVA has also published critical information around benefits for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Agent Orange illnesses. 
I can personally vouch for the incredible efforts of people like Albert and Mary Trombley, Jake Jacobsen, Dennis Ross, Clark Howland, and of course the late Mike Dodge and Don Bodette to establish and foster the growth of grassroots organizations like Chapter 1 in Rutland, Vermont. This individual leadership has ensured a steady growth in VVA's size, stature, and prestige. 
The legislative accomplishments of the VVA through its high-profile presence on Capitol Hill have been impressive. Organizations like Vietnam-era Veterans in Congress, which now boasts 70 members, have served the overall membership well by supporting the pragmatic agenda of the VVA and sticking to its founding principle that `Never again will one generation of veterans abandon another.' 
Today, the VVA has a national membership of 51,000 with more than 500 chapters. VVA state councils in 43 states coordinate the activities and programs of its national organization, ensuring that grassroots input to Congress continues to ensure that the federal government meets its obligations to its Vietnam veterans. 
Mr. President, this Resolution expresses the Senate's gratitude to the organization for its advocacy for its members and wishes it continued success in the years to come. 
  Resolved, 
SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE.  (a) Establishment: There is established a special committee of the Senate to be known as the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the `special committee').

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Goodrich Memorial Library in Newport, Vermont as it recalls 100 years of community service. On May 2, 1998 the Goodrich Memorial Library will kick off a year-long celebration with a wide array of activities for people young and old. 
Converse and Alvira Goodrich donated their entire estate so that Newport Village could construct and maintain a new town library. Architect George Story's vision became reality when the doors were opened and a ceremony held to dedicate the new library on September 1, 1898. An extremely ornate Victorian building, the Goodrich Memorial Library houses a wealth of information for those interested in Vermont history. In one of its rooms, the library maintains an archive of local newspapers dating back to the 1800s and early 1900s. 
The Goodrich Memorial Library not only serves as a resource for information, but also as a critical bond in the community. It brings people together for cultural events and as a shared experience it provides a link between generations. It is a reminder of the town's long and proud history, one that I hope will continue for years to come. 
Once again, I would like to congratulate the Goodrich Memorial Library on its centennial anniversary and wish them the best of luck in the next century of service.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to David Murray, a well known and certainly well regarded patient advocate at the Veterans' Administration (VA) in White River Junction who is leaving the great state of Vermont to relocate to the state of Washington. Although I question why anyone would willingly opt to move from the most beautiful state in the union, I must concede that Washington state is probably a close second in terms of beauty and quality of life. 
I certainly wish Dave well as he embarks on this exciting venture, though life at the Veterans' Administration hospital will never be quite the same without him. Each day he goes beyond the call of duty in his never-wavering advocacy for veterans. He provides veterans and their families with their crucial link to understanding and moving through the system. Dave is probably the most sought after person at the VA and I would venture a guess that he receives more `pages' in one hour than most VA doctors receive in an entire day. 
Service is a word that Dave knows well. He served honorably in the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War, continued his federal service for the next 20 plus years culminating in his current job as Patient Advocate at the VA hospital in White River Junction. He is a member of the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion and involved himself in his community as a boy scout leader. It is my understanding that Dave, when he's not working or wearing one of his many service hats, actually enjoys camping, canoeing and gardening. 
Mr. President, I would like to publicly recognize Dave's outstanding contribution to his fellow veterans and wish him and his wife Diane the very best in their change of venue. I would ask them to remember that if they ever decide to come home to Vermont, we will leave the light on.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Vermont has a long-standing reputation of having the most valiant regiments to be dispatched to the Union Army during the Civil War. Vermonters not only fought bravely for the preservation of the Union and for an end to slavery, they made vital contributions to many important battles. The Union Army was at a great advantage when they were lucky enough to have Vermonters fighting by their side. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Howard Coffin, a Vermonter who has lead the fight for the preservation of this country's hallowed grounds. I am pleased and honored that Howard Coffin will receive the Vermont Civil War Council's `Full Duty" award for his dedication and accomplishments in preserving and understanding of our nation's most cherished and sacred lands. 
Preserving our nation's battlefields is very important to me and a subject very close to Howard's heart. Several years ago I had the privilege to travel with Howard, who is well known as the most prominent Civil War tour guide in Vermont, from battlefield to battlefield. We relived Jackson's battles of the 1862 campaign and retraced the Union campaign of 1864. From that day on I have shared Howard's passion and interest in this country's sacred past. Fortunately for me and this country, Howard took the lead as a member of my staff to find out all we could about the battlefields and what was needed to safeguard this nation's Civil War heritage. It quickly became apparent that the Civil War battlefields were in need of protection. Howard was instrumental in drafting and helping pass important legislation which led to eventual passage of the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Commission and the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission. 
A leader in the effort to preserve Civil War battlefields, Howard has served on the boards of the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites and Protect Historic America and served as member of the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission. He has published several books on the Civil War, including `Full Duty' and his most recent, `Nine Months to Gettysburg,' which tells the story of the Second Vermont Brigade. He also organized the first ever fundraiser for battlefield preservation in Vermont generating over $10,000 for the protection of the battlefield of the 3rd Winchester where Vermonters fought and died so valiantly. 
Mr. President, the American Civil War is thought by many historians to be the fundamental event shaping the character of the United States. However, battlefield sites that are vital to understanding and appreciating our nation's history are in grave danger. This country is lucky to have Howard Coffin on its side, because he will not rest until every field, hill, dam, valley, and woods in this country that has been saturated with the blood of soldiers who fought so bravely are protected and recognized. I am grateful for the foresight and dedication of Howard Coffin and congratulate him on his acceptance of the `Full Duty' award.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Vermont State Housing Authority on its 20th Anniversary of providing Vermonters with access to affordable housing. 
On March 23, 1968, the Vermont State Housing Authority (VSHA), the nation's first statewide housing authority, was established to ensure that Vermonters have access to affordable housing. Over many years of initiative, dedication, and innovation, the VSHA has aggressively and compassionately pursued opportunities to make housing more accessible and affordable for Vermont's neediest families. I celebrate and extend my congratulations to VSHA. 
As a Senator, my highest priorities focus on the essentials for each citizen--economic security, quality education, health care, and meaningful work. We all know that a home is a critical foundation for a successful journey through life.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. It originally was a second-degree amendment to the Kennedy amendment. I understand that the Senator from Massachusetts agrees with our amendment. I appreciate that. But I point out that what we are doing now is trying to make sure that our health care system does what we want it to do, trying to make sure that it is fair to patients and trying to make sure that we provide what is necessary for us to improve the system that is now having some problems. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. 
An important and necessary role for the Federal Government is to foster a competitive marketplace by ensuring that efficient and similar information about the product is available to consumers. Consumers can make their choices according to their own personal beliefs. 
Another role is to ensure fairness, and this amendment provides that. I urge Members to vote for it. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Majority Leader Lott, Chairman Domenici and the members of the Budget Committee for putting together a balanced fiscal blueprint for the Federal Government. The federal budget consists of more than 1,060 spending accounts that fund an estimated 113,000 programs, projects, and activities. The federal budget and a Congressional budget collapse these accounts into twenty budget functions. It was not too long ago that we talked about the ever-increasing deficit and the need to for fiscal restraint of these functions. Under this resolution, the budget would be balanced three years earlier than the Fiscal Year 2002 deadline set out in the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. 
The budget we will be voting on provides for the first surplus in a generation. After reaching a peak of $290 billion in 1992, the unified budget deficit has declined to where the Congressional Budget Office projects a surplus in the current fiscal year of nearly $8 billion. Current laws and policies left unchanged, and real economic growth averaging 2.2 percent annually, the unified budget surplus is projected to grow to $67 billion by 2002. The budget achieves this surplus while also increasing spending by 3.6 percent over last year. 
Even though the budget calls for increased spending, it maintains the principles of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. This budget we have before us today embraces a bipartisan approach of protecting federal programs while preserving the principles of fiscal discipline. 
Mr. President, Chairman Domenici has increased funding in some of the programs that are important to me as Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. The budget provides an additional $15 billion for the National Institute of Health, $5 billion for the IDEA educational programs, and $5 billion for Child Care Block Grants. 
The budget provides funding for the $214 billion Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act that the Senate passed on March 12, 1998. The State of Vermont would average $118 million a year in highway money and $2.5 million for mass transit projects through 2003. Vermont will be able to use funds to reconstruct aging rail lines, repair bridges, and improve major roads throughout the state. Mass transit funding will go to small-town bus systems and minibuses for disabled and handicapped people in rural areas. 
Mr. President, even though this budget provides additional funding on programs that are very important to me, we still have many challenges ahead. The Federal Government still has a $5.5 trillion debt. In Fiscal Year 1998, the Federal Government will spend about $250 billion on interest on the national debt. One out of every seven dollars in taxes goes simply to pay off the bondholders. This money gets diverted from important programs that the Federal Government provides. The Clinton Administration said that without enactment of any budget agreement, debt would have approached $7 trillion by 2002. 
Mr. President, there is $14 trillion in unfunded obligations for the retirement and health care benefits of the Baby-boomer generation. That generation is now just ten years away from starting to impose its unprecedented burdens on its children and grandchildren. We as a nation need to begin to agree on a way to ensure the health care and retirement security of the Baby-boomer generation retirees. 
The economy of the United States is booming and inflation has all but vanished. Unemployment is low and federal budget will be balanced for the first time in 30 years. This budget provides the building blocks to meet the challenges that lie ahead. I call upon my colleagues to build upon the work over the last decade at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and support this budget resolution.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I am here today to discuss aspects of the budget. Today we continue the discussion on our 1999 budget, and I am generally pleased with the work that the committee has done. I am generally optimistic about our country as we progress, but today I wish to place an emphasis on education with a special emphasis on the congressional responsibility for the education of the children of the District of Columbia, the Nation's Capital. 
In 1995, when the Republicans took over the leadership role in Congress, I became chairman of the subcommittee responsible for education on the Labor and Human Resources Committee. I also, as No. 13 in seniority on the Appropriations Committee, became the subcommittee chairman on the DC Appropriations Subcommittee. 
Although I left the Appropriations Committee in 1997 to go to the Finance Committee, I vowed to continue my work for the schoolchildren of the District. I did so to follow through with the work I helped start in 1996, with the writing of the new education plan for the District. 
Also, when I became chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I believed I had a special obligation for education in the District of Columbia. The Constitution, through the District clause, confirmed by the Supreme Court, endows in Congress the same powers over the District of Columbia that a State has--not only powers but responsibilities. Thus, Congress is responsible under the Constitution for the District's education. We must not forget that. 
As Republicans, we believe strongly that State and local governments are the key players in establishing education policy. This conviction works beautifully for every State in the Nation except for the Nation's Capital. What an irony. We, as Republicans in leadership of this Congress, have not fully recognized that under the Constitution we must act as both the State entity for the District and the local governing entity for education. 
In 1996, Congress did recognize that the District's educational system was indeed in trouble; in fact, the whole city was in deep trouble. 
The control board was established to help the District's education crisis. The present DC education reform plan was written in the 1996 appropriations bill with assistance from Congressman Steve Gunderson, who had strong support from the Speaker, and also with the help of the then-Senate majority leader, Bob Dole. The implementation of this plan began in earnest under the leadership of General Becton and continues under Chief Academic Officer Arlene Ackerman. They recently gave a nationally known student achievement test to evaluate basic student performance in the District. It clearly established a severe problem. The Nation's Capital, for which we are constitutionally responsible, has the worst educational results in the country, including the worst student dropout rate of close to 40 percent. 
In addition, through decades of neglect, the District of Columbia has one of the worst school infrastructure problems in the Nation. GSA found that $2 billion of repairs and improvements are needed. 
When I took the chairmanship of the DC Appropriations Subcommittee in 1995, I immediately met with the superintendent, then-Superintendent Franklin Smith, who was a member of the DC school board. 
They all had great intentions and great plans. And, in fact, they had great plans and great intentions for many years, but evaluation results got worse, not better. This was true even though teachers were teaching to the same tests they had been using since 1978. They told them what the tests were going to be. It was obvious that the superintendent of the school board had no control over the system. 
The control board had been established realizing the dimension of the problem. This is back in 1996. They knew that the firm leadership with appropriate authority had to be established. In my mind, the board very wisely chose two generals to answer that challenge--General Williams as financial officer and General Becton as superintendent. In my opinion, the generals, with considerable personal sacrifice, performed admirably, and ably. We are indebted. 
In particular, General Becton is a unique individual. He is 70-plus, but looks 50, and has the energy of a 40-year-old. He is personable and tough. Although not primarily an educator, his accomplishments as president of Prairie View A&M University proved his ability in this field. He got the job done. They both got the job done. The generals had to kick a lot of butts. Friends are not made that way, wounded critics are. But they got results. 
Per-pupil costs are down to within the average in the Washington metropolitan region, a constant source of irritation with many Members who claim they add all this money. They do not anymore. Personnel numbers had been reduced. Many inefficient managers were replaced. The congressionally enacted school reforms are being implemented. Tough decisions, such as ending social promotion, have been made; and that is a tough one. This, of course, has created a great need for remedial help for tens of thousands of kids who must improve to warrant graduation. 
A most qualified chief academic officer, soon to be superintendent, Arlene Ackerman, has been hired. The challenges before her are daunting. The dimension of the remedial help required for ending social promotion, not only in Washington but nationwide, has not yet been fully appreciated. She will need our help. She must have our help. 
As mentioned above, the education infrastructure is in a shameful condition after decades of neglect, requiring $2 billion worth of improvements. Fortunately, Parents United had been formed some time ago and has brought a lawsuit to enforce corrective action. 
Unfortunately, after Generals Williams and Becton had initiated their plans for school repairs, and finally having funding available in a manner that would not have required any closing of the schools, the judge, in her frustration, ordered the schools closed anyway. This caused emergency actions in contracting to get the schools opened and raised the costs considerably. I was present with the control board education trustees the night this happened. They did what they had to do. In fairness to the judge, her frustration, expressed in her ruling, raised the public's awareness to the deplorable condition of the schools. 
But where will the $2 billion needed for repairs come from? Congress is responsible for making it available. This may require money from the budget, it may not, but it has to be found. Bonding is obvious, but how is it to be paid for? 
This January, I held hearings on the DC school situation. 
I have attached Professor Raskin's applicable testimony that the Constitution requires us to find the funds. 
At the beginning of 1997, I left the Appropriations Committee and went to the Finance Committee. I vowed to continue to fight for funds for DC. During reconciliation, I nearly got an amendment for $1 billion passed in the committee. The Senate did provide $50 million for the repairs of the Washington, DC, schools--a small amount, relatively, to the $2 billion. 
In conference with the House, at the House's insistence, the $50 million was cut. But OMB Director Frank Raines agreed to work with me to find the money. He asked me to put together a working group. This has been done. To help prepare material for the working group, I held three days of hearings in January. Material from these hearings has been forwarded to the members of the working group. 
I have also outlined several options for the working group's consideration. Some require no Federal funds; others are completely Federally funded. Somewhere we have to find the answer. I hope we can furnish guidance soon. I have attached materials showing the need for congressional action, as the DC financial system under present circumstances cannot provide a sufficient revenue stream to pay for bonds. 
Let us end on a positive note. Progress is being made to improve the DC school system. I recently traveled to Chicago with General Becton. I also traveled to Long Beach, CA, with Arlene Ackerman. These school systems are examples of sound reform where corrective action is being taken. We learned a great deal on these trips. And work is starting here. 
First, we must make sure children can read and comprehend. Programs such as Everybody Wins!, a literacy-mentoring program I am deeply involved with, have been started, helping thousands of youngsters. Hundreds of our volunteers come from the Senate, and they have been doing a wonderful job in bringing the reading situation in that school under control, but thousands more are needed to help. The flow of nonreaders to upper grades must stop. Substantial growth here is expected by next year in these programs. There are two others called the President's Program for Reading and also another one called the Everybody Reads Program started by the District. 
To help the students `in the pipeline,' summer schools will be held. The second thing: A group to find remedial solutions through information technology has been formed. Much needs to be done. 
No. 3, legislation has been introduced, S. 1070--my bill--to form regional efforts in skill training, giving an opportunity for those young people to be able to get those $30,000 to $50,000 jobs, high-paying jobs, that are available and can be filled. 
No. 4, I also met with the presidents of regional universities and colleges to work together with the business community to form a cohesive, seamless educational system, for which the comprehensive framework should be established by the end of May. And that is critical. We have the resources in this region, we have the people in this region, but we must work together to all do what we can for the school system. 
No. 5, the critical needs for in-service training of teachers must be met. The Department of Education and the local teacher colleges are pledged to help. I just met with some from the Department of Education. The Higher Education Act soon will 
be out on the Senate floor, and that will help, also across the Nation, to assist us with respect to the serious problems we have with our schools not having the professional development necessary. 
Let me close by emphasizing that our problems in education will end only when the classrooms provide the appropriate education. This is a primary responsibility of the States and local school districts. Just remember, as for DC, under the Constitution, DC is our `State.' And we are responsible for our local schools, those in the Nation's Capital. Right now, we have the worst schools in the Nation. They must and they should be the best. 
Madam President, at this time I would like to turn to another education issue dealing with the budget also, and I just alert the Budget Committee as to what is being done.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Finally, I will talk to another matter which will have an impact upon the budget also. Hopefully, CBO comes up with figures you like; these figures are so small in terms of what the good is we should find no cause for alarm here. 
I rise to discuss an issue that is critically important to this Nation. Today there are millions of people with disabilities who want to work but just cannot. Why? Because the day they start work they lose access to affordable health insurance. These bright, intelligent, and very willing individuals are denied the right that every other citizen in this Nation has--the right to work. We have the responsibility to reverse this desperate situation and grant people with disabilities the right to become productive, taxpaying workers. 
Last week, I introduced legislation with Senator Kennedy and Senator Harkin entitled the Work Incentives Improvement Act. This bill will reform Social Security's work incentive programs and remove employment barriers for people with a disability. This legislation was developed over many months with the help of the disability community, the Social Security Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration and other congressional offices. This bill will end the insurmountable health barriers to individuals who wish to work. 
Our friends with disabilities do not need an incentive to work. They want to work. In fact, they are so desperate to obtain gainful employment that they are pushing this Congress to complete action on this legislation this year. And we must. These citizens are trapped by a system that penalizes their attempts to be productive. Social Security's current work incentive system has had limited success. Out of 7.5 million people who are social security disability beneficiaries, less than one percent can take advantage of these work incentives and actually are employed. The benefits offered are too expensive, time limited, and offer too few health care services for the many persons with disabilities who wish to work. 
For many years I have assessed why so few disabled social security beneficiaries return to work. The primary barriers relate to their inability to obtain or keep adequate and affordable health care coverage. For example, disabled social security beneficiaries who return to work are covered through Medicare, but after 39 months they must pay full fare for their health benefits--more than $370 every month. I seriously doubt that even a well-off person can afford to pay this rate every month over the course of their working life. In fact, out of more than 3.5 million beneficiaries, only 114 have chosen to take advantage of this Medicare coverage, preferring the alternative--staying at home and receiving it for free. I don't know whether they prefer it; that is probably not right. 
Another barrier to work is the inability to get coverage for certain medical services. These services are usually unavailable in the private markets. If they are available, they are unaffordable. Necessities like personal assistance services and prescription drug coverage are offered through some state Medicaid plans, but disabled social security beneficiaries who need access to these Medicaid services must impoverish themselves to get them. Many are doing just that. These disabled social security individuals who have coverage for low-income Medicaid, called `dual eligibles,' are the fastest growing entitlement population in the government. 
The Work Incentives Improvement Act will provide access to appropriate health insurance for those persons with disabilities who wish to return to work. Many of these beneficiaries will be eligible for affordable Medicare. Beneficiaries will have access to limited Medicaid services through State Work Options Programs. They will be able to access critical services like Personal Assistance and prescription drugs in states that chose to offer them. Such incentives will allow people to return to work, confident in the knowledge that they will both keep their health care and get coverage for other needed services. 
No one in this body can disagree with the idea that work is a central part of the American dream. This budget resolution should provide funding for these and other initiatives designed to allow people with disabilities to work. Providing cost-effective assistance for people to work is both fiscally responsible and morally right. Those who work will become fully contributing members of society by paying for their own insurance coverage, and as taxpaying citizens of our nation, paying for these government programs as a whole. 
Inaction by this body will ensure that our Government continues to deny a person's dream to get back to work to help himself, to help herself, to pay taxes, to be able to participate in our society in a meaningful way. I hope the Senate will move ahead to resolve this problem and help persons with disabilities realize their dream to work. 
I wish everyone had a chance to be at the press conference we held with former leader Bob Dole and Justin Dart and other leaders in this field to see the expression on their faces and the joy that came when we announced what we would do to help those who were assembled to be able to participate in the workplace. I can assure Members that this bill--we have had CBO estimates much lower than previous estimates. It is hard to conceive why it costs money because all you are doing is allowing people benefits to work and to start paying taxes and to contribute to the cost. 
It is very difficult for me to see how there is any cost whatever. I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will be introducing a bill today in relation to the changes that we have worked on with members, of course, of both parties in our committee with respect to the higher educational programs. 
There is nothing more important to this Nation than maintaining our international superiority as the country with the best higher education. That is the reason this Nation is where it is today. And if we allow that to sink, as we have allowed our k-12 to sink, then, Mr. President, we will be sliding down, in the next century, to a position of lesser importance. 
I am introducing the bill today--with Senators Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd--the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. This legislation is a product of work begun by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources over a year ago. 
The Higher Education Act is among the most significant statutes under the jurisdiction of the committee. Since its inception in 1965, the act has been focused on enhancing the opportunities of students to pursue postsecondary education. The grant, loan, and work-study assistance made available by this act has made the difference for the countless millions in pursuing their dreams for a better life. 
At the start of the reauthorization process, we set out to achieve a number of important goals designed to strengthen these programs. I am pleased to say that this legislation achieves the five major objectives identified at the beginning of our efforts. 
First, the bill preserves the focus on students, who are the prime reason we have a Higher Education Act in the first place. Students now in school will be assured of receiving a lower interest rate on their loans and will see less of their own earnings penalized with respect to the Pell grant awards they receive. Students now in high school who aspire to a college education will continue to benefit from early intervention programs, including the National Early Intervention Scholarship Program--NEISP--and TRIO. Students who have graduated and are faced with exceptionally high loan burdens will be able to take advantage of extended repayment options under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. 
Second, the bill takes a two-pronged approach to helping our Nation's elementary and secondary school teachers. They will be thoroughly prepared to offer the quality of instruction needed to assure that students achieve the standards we need and expect. Working at both the State level to promote system-wide reforms and at the local level to develop partnerships to enhance the quality of teacher training, the bill offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to this pressing national need. No longer will the Higher Education Act contain a collection of small, unfunded teacher training programs. Rather, the good ideas represented in these proposals--along with the many useful suggestions made by members of the committee--have been shaped into a broad approach. It is an approach which I hope will command the attention and support of Congress when we turn to the appropriations bill. 
Third, the bill reflects a strong commitment to the maintenance of two viable loan programs--the guaranteed or Federal Family Education Loan Program, known as FFELP, and the Direct Loan Program. To the extent possible within budgetary constraints, the bill levels the playing field to assure the continuation of fair and healthy competition between the two programs. 
Fourth, the bill takes important steps to improve the delivery of student assistance programs. In cooperation with the administration, we have developed a performance-based organization--a PBO--designed to strengthen the management of key systems with the Department of Education. A number of provisions in the legislation also pave the way toward taking advantage of efficiencies made possible through electronic processing and other technological advances. 
Finally, we have made every attempt to streamline programs, including the streamlining of the act itself. This bill takes nearly 50 programs off the books--off the books--and cuts in half the number of titles in the act. We have also attempted to relieve the regulatory burden on program participants while protecting the strong and effective integrity provisions included in the 1992 reauthorization. 
Perhaps one of the most difficult issues to resolve has been the change in the student loan interest rate scheduled to take effect on July 1 of this year. This has, of course, been a strong concern of the Budget Committee. This legislation adopts the proposal approved a few weeks ago by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. For several months, Members of the House and the Senate have grappled with the issue. The dilemma has been to balance the desire to offer students the lowest possible interest rate while assuring an uninterrupted flow of loan capital so that borrowing will be possible. 
All analysts have concluded that allowing the scheduled rate to go into effect will mean the demise of the FFEL program. That outcome is unacceptable, given the substantial likelihood of program disruption. 
The Direct Loan Program, which now handles only 30 percent of total loan volume, simply is not in a position to pick up the slack. To do anything to interrupt the ability of our young people to participate in the FFEL program would be a disaster at this time. The solution offered by the House committee included in the bill is by no means perfect. Like Winston Churchill's comments about democracy, however, I say: This proposal is the worst possible option, except for all others. 
I am extremely appreciative of the hard work which my colleagues on the committee put into the development of this bipartisan bill. The committee will be considering this measure on Wednesday, and I hope that the full Senate will have the opportunity to debate it in the near future.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, 2 months ago I informed the Senate about an ice storm that hit sections of the northeast in early January with such force and destruction it was named the ice storm of the century. I am pleased to support S.1768, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations of 1998, to help bring much needed relief to citizens in not only the Northeast, but other areas of the country who have suffered from natural disaster. 
Mr. President, for two days straight, freezing rain, snow and sleet battered the Champlain Valley of Vermont, upstate New York, parts of New Hampshire and Maine and the Province of Quebec. Tens of thousands of trees buckled and shattered under the stress and weight of several inches of ice that coated their branches. Power lines were ripped down by falling branches and the weight of the ice--leaving hundreds of thousands of people without electricity for days and even weeks. Roads were covered with ice and rivers swelled and overflowed from heavy rain. The crippling ice storm brought activity in the area to a grinding halt. 
Just a few days after the storm, Senator Leahy and I visited the hardest hit areas of Vermont. The storm's damage was the worst I have ever seen. In the Burlington area twenty to twenty-five percent of the trees were toppled or must be chopped down. Another twenty-five percent were damaged. The storm also destroyed sugarbushes and dropped trees across hiking trails and snowmobile trails. 
Mr. President, local and State emergency officials acted quickly to help their fellow Vermonters and assess the damage. Vermonters rallied, with the help of the National Guard, to help themselves and their neighbors. As the temperatures dropped below zero, days after the storm, with thousands still without power, volunteer firefighters, police officers, national guard troops and every able bodied citizen came together working day and night to help feed, heat, and care for the people in their community. The organized and volunteer responses to this disaster were incredible. Stories of Vermonters helping Vermonters were commonly told throughout the disaster counties and state. 
Hardest hit were dairy farmers. Already struggling to make ends meet due to low milk prices, the ice storm left farms without power to milk their cows. During the first few days of the storm the majority of the milk had to be dumped. Milk became non-marketable because it could not be sufficiently cooled or it could not be transported to the processing plants. Farms without generators missed milkings all together or significantly altered the milking schedules. As a result, cows became infected with mastitis and reduced production. In addition, cows became infected with respiratory illnesses due to poor air circulation in the barns. Even farms with generators were affected. Since the power was out for such a long duration the generators could not provide adequate wattage to precisely run the milking systems, resulting in mastitis and loss production. 
The major impact on dairy farms as a result of the ice storm was non-marketable milk and production loss. The loss of even one milk check for many of the farms will have an adverse impact on their business. Current milk prices are not sufficient to offset such losses. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have worked with me and others in the disaster areas to recognize and respond to the needs of the affected regions. The 1998 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations will bring much needed relief to Vermont's most severely affected areas. Dairy farmers will be compensated for production loss and loss of livestock. Maple producers will be helped by replacing taps and tubing. Land owners will be aided in clearing debris and replanting trees destroyed by the storm. 
Mr. President, the citizens and trees of Vermont, as well as upstate New York, Maine and New Hampshire have suffered from this storm. Local and State assistance will help communities and individuals get back on their feet, but Federal relief will ensure that the disaster areas are not overwhelmed by the recovery.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to speak first very briefly on the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri that would help the disaster areas of the Northeast. 
First I want to commend the Senator from Missouri for helping the areas of the Northeast that were so punished by the recent problems with respect to the ice storms. Vermont suffered very significantly in the upper part of the State, but with the knowledge that we have with respect to what happened in New York and Maine which so far outpaced our problems, I can certainly commiserate with their need to have assistance, especially with respect to utilities, which have been greatly harmed by the weather problem.

Mr. JEFFORDS. 
Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today, with my friend and colleague, Senator Edward Kennedy, to introduce the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998. 
This bill has developed over many months with the help of the disability community, the Social Security Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration and other Congressional offices to help the insurmountable health barriers to individuals who wish to work, but must remain dependent on the Social Security Disability system to continue to access needed health benefits provided by the Federal and State governments. 
Mr. President, the current system has had very limited success. The benefits offered are too expensive, time limited, and offer too few health care services for the many persons with disabilities who wish to work. Currently, less than 5 percent of beneficiaries have taken advantage of this so called work incentive. 
Mr. President, I have worked for more than a year with Senator Kennedy to assess why so few SSI and SSDI beneficiaries return to work. We have found that the primary barrier is a lack of available health care coverage--this needed coverage is either unavailable or unaffordable in the private sector for those with disabilities. 
Specific barriers facing individuals with disabilities who want to work include an inability to obtain affordable health insurance through Medicare. After a period of time on the current SSDI work incentives program, the individual must pay full fare--more than $370 a month. We researched how many individuals take advantage of this and would you believe, Mr. President, that out of more than 3.5 million beneficiaries, only 114 have chosen to buy in to Medicare. People with disabilities simply cannot afford the coverage over more than a short period of time. 
Another barrier is that the critical services people with disabilities need are unavailable. Personal assistance services and drugs are available only through a state's Medicaid plan. SSDI beneficiaries do not have access to Medicaid unless they impoverish themselves to get it. When we looked into this we found that SSDI people who need Medicaid covered services, those so-called `dual eligibles,' are the fastest growing entitlement population in the government. For those SSI beneficiaries who have access to Medicaid, personal assistance services are covered in only half the states. 
Mr. President, our Work Incentive Improvement Act will provide incentives for persons with disabilities to return to work and still be able to access health insurance. It will ensure that an attempt to work, or an inability to remain working, does not penalize participants for future SSDI and SSI eligibility. 
Under our legislation, those SSDI applicants who want to return to work could access Medicare Part A for free. If their incomes rise above 250 percent of poverty they would buy-in based on 10 percent of earned income above 250 percent. Part B premium contributions would remain the same. They would also be able to access a new State Work Options Program that provides personal assistance services and prescription drugs to those states that chose to set one up. 
Long term disabled SSDI beneficiaries who have been receiving cash benefits for more than 24 months would be eligible for Medicare A&B for the same rates as described above, the State Work Options Program, and an expanded Impairment Related Work Expense to include the cost of automobiles in areas where accessible transportation is unavailable. Such an incentive would do much to keep an individuals income below SGA, and be more likely to keep their cash benefits. 
Persons with disabilities who are working under SSI's work incentive program would have access to the State Work Options Programs if they needed personal assistance services to begin working. The legislation also strengthens current State Medicaid Waiver projects that provide health services and supports to persons with disabilities who want to work. 
This legislation also supports the development of demonstration projects that gradually phase out the loss of cash benefits as a worker's income rises, instead of the current cash cut-off that so many disabled persons who return to work face today. 
Finally, this legislation will enable Congress to obtain the kind of information it needs to undertake more comprehensive reform of disability work incentive programs. 
Mr. President, no one in this body can disagree with the idea that work is a central part of the American dream. I am committed to ensuring this Congress that we pass legislation to provide cost-effective assistance to help disabled Americans pursue a career, and the American dream.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to announce my co-sponsorship of `The Health Professions Education Partnerships Act of 1998.' My colleague Senator Frist, the Chair of the Labor and Human Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, has drafted this legislation reauthorizing the important programs contained in Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. This legislation provides comprehensive, flexible, and effective authority for the support of health professions training programs and the related community-based educational partnerships. The enactment of this Act will improve health workforce quality, diversity, and the distribution of funds while requiring greater accountability of both the grant recipients of federal funds and the agency that administers them. 
Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act have provided programs of support to health professions schools and their students, for the past thirty-five years. As these programs have evolved, there has been a continuing need to address the specific concerns of rural and inner-city communities that experience shortages of health professionals and a lack of primary care providers. This reauthorization will allow the Title VII and VIII programs to set improved goals and outcomes measures and it also provides them with greater flexibility in establishing priorities to target emerging workforce issues. 
In my own State of Vermont, the students of the University of Vermont's College of Medicine have benefited from a number of these programs and scholarships, including those relating to family medicine, professional nurse and nurse practitioner training. 
The newest Title VII program in Vermont is the Area Health Education Center (AHEC) which opened its first site in April 1997 in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. The AHEC will decentralize health professions education by having portions of the training provided in primary medical personnel shortage areas and by improving the coordination and use of existing health resources. Over the next two years, two additional sites are planned in other underserved areas of the state. These efforts have contributed to making Vermont a better place to obtain health care services and improved the quality of life for its residents. 
Again, I want to thank Senator Frist and his excellent staff for their dedication and hard work in drafting the `Health Professions Education Partnership Act of 1998.' Enactment of this legislation will improve health professions training programs across America and, as the Chair of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I intend to make its passage one of our highest priorities.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, this amendment gives the States the tools necessary to preserve our Nation's historic covered bridges. These picturesque relics of past industrial genius continue to serve many important functions. However, covered bridges are quickly disappearing due to arson, floods, decay and simple neglect. Without proper and consistent maintenance, these engineering masterpieces will slowly fade into history. 
Today I am proposing that the Federal Government assist towns and counties across the Nation in restoring and protecting historic covered bridges. Together with States, local communities and committed preservationists, we can curb the decay of these treasures and protect them for generations to come. 
This country once boasted 12,000 covered bridges. Today, less than 800 remain. Not too long ago transportation officials started tearing down these old landmarks by the bunches in favor of more modern and accessible bridges. Arsonists have been a highly visible threat. Weather has taken its toll. Many old bridges have been carried off by floods or collapsed under the weight of heavy snows. 
Of course, weather would not be so destructive if it were not for the most dangerous and imminent risk--neglect. Without proper and consistent maintenance, covered bridges slowly decay and eventually fall to harsh weather or flooding. 
Behind me are two pictures of covered bridges in Vermont. Many of our Nation's historic wooden bridges are in this shape. Others are suffering, but some are being preserved as this picture shows. With proper care and maintenance, covered bridges can be preserved, as this one is, so they might be enjoyed throughout the years. 
A majority of these wooden structures still perform their original duties but still carry more traffic and weight than their designers anticipated, often leading to weight-related collapse. 
The cost to properly rehabilitate a working covered bridge comes close to $500,000. Some bridges are far more expensive. Many of these bridges are on town roads, off the National Highway System, and tend not to be a priority. But these bridges must not be lost. 
This amendment will direct the Secretary of Transportation to fund the efforts to inventory, repair and maintain our Nation's covered bridges. Moneys provided by the measure give the States the ability to fully restore their covered bridges ensuring the safety of travelers without compromising the bridges' historical integrity. 
This amendment calls for proper research, construction and maintenance techniques. The proposal will provide funds for fire, arson and vandalism prevention. These grants to States will prove vital to ensuring the covered bridges survive into the next century, into the next millennium. 
These covered bridges stand as a reminder of our heritage and contribute immensely to making our Nation the beautiful place it is today. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
I commend the authors of this legislation, Senators Chafee, Warner, and Baucus, for completing action on this measure.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have closely monitored the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) over the past year to ensure its successful implementation and consistency with legislative intent. 
On February 11, 1997, the Committee held its first oversight hearing on proposed HIPAA regulations relating to minimum standards for the access, portability, and renewability of health coverage for both fully insured and self-funded plans. Today, I am releasing a new GAO Report, entitled `Health Insurance Standards: New Federal Law Creates Challenges for Consumers, Insurers, Regulators (GAO/HEHS 98-67),' that examines the HIPAA first year implementation issues and challenges that consumers, issuers of health coverage, state insurance regulators, and federal regulators have faced since HIPAA's passage. The findings of this report will be the focus of a second Labor Committee HIPAA oversight hearing that is scheduled for March 19, 1998. 
One of HIPAA's most important features is that it provides people who lose their group insurance coverage with guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market--regardless of their health status. However, the GAO found that the complex nature of the law, as well as, insurance carrier practices, and insurance product pricing have hindered many consumers from benefiting from this provision. Some insurance carriers have charged rates that are 140 to 600 percent of the standard premium to people who lose group coverage, and, thus, effectively discouraging them from obtaining the needed individual health insurance coverage. In addition, HIPAA guarantees access to coverage only if certain eligibility criteria have been met. These criteria include having a minimum of 18 months of prior coverage, the exhaustion of all residual employer coverage, and the application for individual coverage within 63 days of the termination of group coverage. Many consumers are not aware of these requirements and are at risk of forfeiting their right to coverage in the individual market. 
Another GAO finding relates to HIPAA's certificate of coverage requirement. Health coverage providers, including employers and insurance carriers, believe that certain HIPAA regulatory provisions create an administrative burden, unanticipated consequences, and the potential for consumer abuse. 
Although most insurance issuers comply with the Act by providing the mandated certificate of coverage to individuals terminating their insurance, most believe that the process is costly and unnecessary. They feel it would be more efficient to issue the certificates of coverage only to those who request them. The GAO also examined the guaranteed renewal provision and its relationship to other programs such as Medicare. Once eligible for Medicare, HIPAA does not permit issuers to cancel individual coverage. As a consequence, consumers could be left with more expensive, redundant coverage. In addition, the GAO found that the special enrollment periods for group plan enrollees may create opportunities for consumer abuse. Individuals could switch from plans with large deductibles to those with `first dollar' low deductibles in anticipation of medical expenses. Insurance issuers fear such practices will raise overall costs. 
The GAO found that implementing and enforcing HIPAA has been challenging for state insurance regulators due to certain unclear provisions. The provisions cited by the GAO that may need further clarification include those relating to risk-spreading, preexisting conditions, nondiscrimination, and the late enrollee requirements in the group market. The process of clarifying these regulations by the three federal agencies involved in implementing HIPAA (DHHS, DOL and IRS) is ongoing. 
The report also confirms that federal regulators have faced an overwhelming, new role under HIPAA. In the five states that have failed to pass the legislation required by HIPAA (CA, MA, MI, RI and MO), the Department of Health and Human Services is now required to act as insurance regulator for certain provisions. The department may also have to play a regulatory role in the District of Columbia and some U.S. territories. Meeting these new state regulatory duties has put a financial burden on the agency. As a result, DHHS has requested an additional $15.5 million to fund 65 new full time equivalent staff and contractor support for HIPAA related enforcement activities in fiscal year 1999. 
Mr. President, this new GAO report updates the progress in implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and highlights important areas for additional oversight. Consumers leaving their group coverage are facing barriers to individual coverage. Some issuers of health coverage are concerned about the additional administrative burden of HIPAA and its possible unintended consequences. And there are areas of the law that need further clarification for state regulators. The Department of Health and Human Services' new role implementing and enforcing HIPAA may also require additional resources. 
In addition to this report, another GAO report on the extent to which large employers have access to health insurance will be completed by the end of May. These two GAO reports and their findings will help Congress in our quest to ensure a successful implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Senator Frist for taking an important step that brings together a number of Government programs of research, treatment and disease prevention for women. Over the past several years, Congress and the Nation have become increasingly concerned about women's health. I appreciate the leadership and the expertise that Dr. Frist brings to Congress about these issues. We have much to learn about recognizing and treating the medical needs of women. 
In the first session of the 105th Congress, at least 21 bills relating to women's health were introduced and referred to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. At our committee hearing on women's health last July, we heard about important advances being made in research. We also heard about significant gaps of knowledge which need to be filled. More importantly, we recognize how important it is to get information about scientific advances to the public and their health care providers. 
Thus, I am pleased the provisions of this bill provide for research and for public and professional education. We know that once the information is out to the public and health care professionals, we need screening programs, closely followed by access to treatment. The bill provides for important patient services. 
Finally, once common conditions are well recognized, detected and treated, we need data to track our progress in disease prevention and to alert us to new help in illness trends. This bill provides for these functions through the support for cancer registries, information systems, and program evaluation. It is my hope that having women's issues collected together in one bill will focus the attention of Congress and the Nation on vigorous support of the woman's health initiative. 
I am pleased to join Senator Frist in sponsoring this legislation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. 
Mr. President, today, I join with my good friend Senator Lieberman to introduce the Health Care Quality, Education, Security, and Trust Act--`The Health Care QUEST Act'--in order to improve the quality of our nation's health care system and provide necessary consumer protections without adding significant new costs; increasing litigation; or micro managing health plans. 
Over the past decade across the country, an extraordinary change has taken place in the delivery of health care. In 1996, over 67% of Americans received their health care through managed care--almost double the percentage that existed in 1990. However, this transition has not been problem-free. Many consumers worry that the quality of their health care is being sacrificed to cut costs. While the traditional fee-for-service health care system was guilty of over utilization and runaway costs, consumers did feel that they would get the necessary services, treatment, and information to recover from a serious illness or manage a chronic health problem. People are now worried that managed care only manages costs and, in effect, rations care. One consequence of this transformation is that Americans are losing confidence in the quality of care they receive from our health system. 
The American Association of Health Plans' voluntary initiative to respond to these concerns, `Putting Patients First,' is an important step and I urge that they continue to expand this effort. Businesses, such as General Motors and GTE, have also initiated programs to improve the quality of the health care received by their employees. In addition, a number of states have already passed legislative initiatives to address many of the problems consumers have experienced with their health plans. However, I believe that Federal legislation is necessary because the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) prevents states from enforcing health care quality standards that relate to the employer-sponsored health benefits that 148 million Americans receive. 
The Health Care QUEST Act addresses these concerns through four provisions. First, it creates a Health Quality Council to set national goals for improving health and serve as a resource for Congress and the President regarding health care quality. Second, it expands the duties and responsibilities of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) in order to develop the tools needed to measure and report health care quality. The Act also requires that employers and health plans provide enrollees with health plan information such as measures of consumer satisfaction and their right to access speciality health services. Finally, the Act calls for the establishment of the `prudent layperson' standard of access to emergency room care, the right to use an impartial independent external appeals process and the guarantee that a patient's health care professional is able to recommend the best treatment options and to serve as their advocate. 
These provisions will help to restore consumers confidence in the quality of our nation's health care system and provide a level playing field--so that managed care plan compete on the basis of quality as well as cost. Based on an analysis by the Lewin Group, the added costs for information disclosure and external appeals requirements are extremely low. The estimated monthly cost per person for comparative information and for external appeals with a three year phase-in is only $0.88. This cost estimate doesn't take into account the improved market efficiency and increased competition that the Lewin Group indicates will be achieved with these requirements. 
Much of the debate over this issue to date in Washington has been conducted from two very divergent viewpoints. Many House members, and some in the Senate, believe we should regulate health care very closely, on a disease-by-disease or procedure-by-procedure basis. Another sizable camp believes that there is nothing wrong with the health care marketplace that can't be be sorted out by its own operation. 
Obviously, I disagree. And Congress, too, disagreed when it confronted many of these issues in the Medicare program last year. Much of what I propose in the Health Care QUEST Act is contained in the `Balanced Budget Act of 1997' and applies to plans that enroll Medicare beneficiaries. Extending the same standards to the private sector will ensure that all Americans have the same rights and protections. 
The states have developed comprehensive approaches that provide regulation for those components of the health care system under their jurisdiction. The challenge for the federal government is to define regulatory solutions for those sectors under federal control that advance the consumer choice health care market while recognizing the voluntary nature of our private system. These regulatory solutions, in my opinion, should not determine medical necessity, establish hospital lengths-of-stay, or impede private sector initiatives. Furthermore, we must not set into statute standards that would preclude efforts for continued quality improvement or fail to recognize the evolutionary nature of medical practice. 
The McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 granted states the authority to regulate the business of insurance. However, ERISA preempted state law with regard to the regulation of employee benefit plans. While ERISA provides detailed standards for employer provided pensions, it provides only minimal standards for health plans. Currently about 41 percent of those who receive their health coverage through employer-sponsored plans are in self-insured health plans. The Health Care Quest Act follows the framework established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) by setting national standards for employer sponsored plans under ERISA and a federal floor for insurance companies to follow that states can build upon. 
The Health Care QUEST Act will help to restore consumer confidence in our health care system and also promote market efficiency and accountability. I look forward to working with other Senators to enact legislation this year that establishes necessary consumer protections and sets national standards to guide our nation's market based health care reform efforts.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the key to our children's future, and to commemorate an individual who dedicated his life's work to this great cause. Through a resolution sponsored by my good friend Senator Chuck Robb, and co-sponsored by myself and 91 other Senate co-sponsors, today has been proclaimed Read Across America Day. The day to celebrate the 94th birthday of Dr. Seuss and a day when all across the country adults will be reading out loud to children. 
In fact, Senator Robb is unable to join me right now because he spent the morning reading to kids at a local elementary school, but I know that you will be hearing from him later. First, I would like to say a few words about the crisis we face as a nation if we don't all work toward improving literacy in this Nation. 
Reading is the key to our children's future. There is an easy way to think about this: from first to third grades you learn to read--from third grade on you read to learn. Now, we have heard some frightening statistics as of late, about our children's performance in various subjects compared to other nations. I want to remind my colleagues and everyone in every community around the country--we have a 51 percent functional illiteracy rate in kids who are graduating from high school. That means, these kids can't read a newspaper, balance a checkbook or read a bus schedule to get themselves to a job, let alone hold down a good job. This, in America, is a tragedy. And we must stop it. We must all be a part of the solution. 
Reading aloud to children, beginning at the youngest age, is a big part of the solution. A national commission on reading found that reading out loud to a child for at least 30 minutes a day is the single most important factor to the child learning to read and loving to read. And so, on what would have been his 94th birthday, I say thank you to Dr. Seuss, whose given name was Mr. Theodor Geisel, for all the fantastic, creative and wonderful books he gave to countless numbers of parents and children to enjoy in this most significant activity for a child's success. 
Many pro-literacy groups have sponsored activities so that every child in the country is read aloud to by an adult for at least a half hour today. I endorse this activity whole-heartedly--and I try to lead by example by read-ing to my reading partner in the Everybody Wins! program that I launched here in Washington three years ago. 
The Everybody Wins! program pairs adult reading mentors with young children in elementary schools to foster a love of reading and of learning and to provide that critical reading aloud activity. I am so proud of all the Congressional Members and staff participating in the program--now totaling more than 450 reading every day of the week during lunch hour at two schools here on Capitol Hill. In all we now have 10 schools and 1200 reading partners and students participating in the Everybody Wins! program. But we must reach many, many more children. We need 10 times that if we are going to do what we should be doing in the District of Columbia. 
The Everybody Wins! program has benefitted enormously from corporate support to help us reach more children. 
As it happens, tomorrow night is the third annual event that makes expansion of Everybody Wins! possible--it is called Links to Literacy and takes place just a stone's throw from here in Union Station. With complete bi-partisan support, and sponsored by the PGA tour we hope to be able to impact many more children in the year to come. I want to thank all of my colleagues who joined with me in lending their names to Links to Literacy and I look forward to seeing all of you tomorrow night. 
Also, I want to commend some extraordinary programs at work in my home state of Vermont: Mother Goose Logs On, a collaborative effort between Nynex and IBM that improves literacy through interactive technology; the America Reads program that so many of our college students are tutoring in and the Vermont Center for the Book which has worked to improve access to books for kids in so many ways. When everyone in the community becomes involved and when adults read aloud to children--Everybody Wins! 
I thank all my colleagues who helped pass this resolution. 
I just want to indicate we have a number of these Links to Literacy '98, Everybody Wins invitations available to those who would like to participate tomorrow night. The Singing Senators will be there to make sure the event is enjoyable for everyone. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I think it is important for us to take a close look at what this does to make sure that we understand that it is really hard for anyone to be against it as near as I can tell. It is not the end-all of the situation that we face or the problems that need to be handled, by any means, but it does take into consideration doing something where nothing is done now to alert the public to who is behind the things that are being thrown on television. 
I can just imagine a candidate, and this happens now, I am sure, when they think they are running their campaign, they had it all organized and they are watching carefully the amount of money their opponent has, and then they wake up one morning thinking they are in fine shape and every channel they turn on on the television has this ad attacking them at the last moment, the last couple of weeks before the election, and they don't know who it is coming from or what to do about it; they were not aware of it. 
All we say is, OK, that can happen; but at least 45, 50, 60 days before it happens, you know it will happen. That is all we are saying. So that you don't get the surprise attacks by somebody who is running so-called issue ads that did not place them under the FEC regulations with respect to supporting that candidate. 
That is the real world we are faced with. It happened last time. It happened to the tune of $135 million. The least we could do, the very least, is to say at least you ought to know it is coming, first; and No. 2, where it is coming from so you have an idea when you get this last-minute flurry of advertising you are ready to do the best you can to protect yourself against it. 
Again, I want to commend the Senator for the continued leadership on this very important issue. Senator Snowe mentioned yesterday and today it is the duty of leaders to lead, and that means making some difficult choices in doing the right thing. On the issue, Senator Snowe has been a true leader. Crafting a compromise is often difficult. I thank the Senator from Maine for leading this body to a logical resolution, one which is sensible and one which is so commonsensical it is hard to understand why anybody would be against it, 
As was discussed yesterday, the basic tenets of the Snowe amendment are boosting disclosure requirements and tightening expenditures of certain funds in the weeks preceding a primary and general election. The amendment strengthens the McCain-Feingold bill in these areas in a reasonable manner. I could not support the McCain-Feingold bill until something was put into that area which is going to be the most used area. It is the first time it was used in the last election and we saw $135 million or more come in to the election. You have to remember that power is what those who are spending money seek. The money is going to follow that group which is most effective in gaining that power. Our job is to know where it comes from. 
The last Presidential election shows how terrible our means are to trace the money now. This is an opportunity to trace effectively, to know where it is coming from, you have a chance to understand where it came from. The last few election cycles have shown the spending has grown astronomically in two areas that cause me great concern: First, issue ads that have turned into blatant electioneering; second, the unfettered spending by corporations and unions to influence the outcomes of elections. 
As an example of how this spending has grown, a House Member from Michigan in 1996 faced nearly $2 million in advertisements alone before the fall campaigning season had begun. Campaigning really starts early and then there is a big boost at the end. Early on you want to knock the candidate out before he has a chance to get on the scene, and at the end it is because you know a large percentage of the people who vote really don't pay much attention until the last couple of weeks. The Snowe-Jeffords amendment addresses these areas in a reasonable, equitable, and, last but not least, constitutional way. 
Mr. President, citizens across this Nation have grown weary of the tenor of campaigns in recent years. This disappointment is reflected in low voter participation and the diminished role of individuals in electing their representatives. Increasing the information available to the electorate will help return the power of this democratic aspect to the people who should have it--the voters. Expanded disclosure will bring daylight to this process. Increased disclosure will rid corruption; more disclosure will protect the public and the candidates. 
How can we deny our electorate the ability to know the sponsors of electioneering communications? Give the people the information they need to better evaluate those Federal candidates that they will be voting on. Each of us should ask or be fully informed before we vote on a bill or amendment. How can we as Members of Congress stand here and say that the public should not have all the information they need before stepping into the voting booth? 
Additionally, the disclosure required in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment will help deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of impropriety that many feel pervades our campaign finance system. Armed with this information, voters are guaranteed access to the truth. This change will restore the public's confidence in the election process and their elected representatives. 
As noted yesterday, the Annenberg Public Policy Center report figured there were somewhere between $135 to $150 million spent during the 1996 elections on so-called issue ads. This is a conservative estimate prepared very specifically not to lead to any exaggeration. The Annenberg report found that nearly 87 percent of these ads mentioned a candidate of office by name, and over 41 percent were seen by the public as pure attack ads. You ought to know who paid for them so we can better judge whether or not to believe them. This is the highest percentage recorded among a group that also included Presidential ads, debates, free time segments, court candidates, and new programs. Clearly, these ads were overtly aimed at electing or defeating targeted candidates, but under current law these ads were not subject to disclosure requirements of any nature. 
The second part of our amendment considers an area Congress has long had a solid record on: imposing more strenuous spending restrictions on corporations and labor unions. Remember, under the law, these are not given the same freedom of speech rights that individuals are, and rightfully so. Corporations have been banned from electioneering since 1907; unions, since 1947. As the Supreme Court pointed out in United States v. UAW, Congress banned corporate and union contributions in order to `avoid the deleterious influences on Federal elections resulting from the use of money by those who exercise control over large aggregations of capital.' 
Our amendment would ban corporations and unions from using General Treasury funds to fund electioneering communications in the last 60 days of the general election and the last 30 days before a primary. They still have the right to foster and to approve PACs, organizations for their employees or members of the union, to contribute to, in order that they individually, working together in the PACs, can influence the election process. 
The Snowe amendment takes a reasoned, incremental and constitutional step to address the concerns many of my colleagues have voiced on campaign finance reform proposals. 
Mr. President, some of our colleagues have expressed constitutional concerns with our amendment. Let me assure Members that we have taken great pains to craft a clear and narrow amendment on this issue in order to pass two critical first amendment doctrines that were at the heart of the Supreme Court's landmark Buckley decision, vagueness and overbreadth. Vagueness could chill free speech if someone who would otherwise speak chose not to because the rules aren't clear and they fear running afoul of the law. We agree that free speech should not be chilled and that is why our rules are very clear. 
Any sponsor will know with certainty if their ad is an electioneering ad. There would be no question the way we have delineated within the bill. 
Overbreadth could unintentionally sweep in a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech. Our amendment is so narrow that it easily satisfies the Supreme Court's overbreadth concerns. We have asked the experts to check and give us advice on this. It is not just merely our opinion. We strictly limit our requirements to ads run near an election that identify a candidate--ads plainly intended to convince voters to vote for or against a particular candidate. 
As the Court declared in Buckley, the governmental interests that justified disclosure of election-related spending are considerably broader and more powerful than those justifying prohibitions or restrictions on election-related spending. 
Disclosure rules, the Court said, enhance the information available to the voting public. Who can be against that? Disclosure rules, according to the Court, are `the least restrictive means of curbing evils of campaign ignorance and corruption.' And our disclosure rules are immensely reasonable. 
As James Madison said:  
A popular government without popular information is but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or perhaps both. 
Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. 
Mr. President, our amendment will arm the voters in order to sustain our popular Government. I fear that without our amendment, and campaign finance reform generally, the disillusionment of the voting public will grow, along with the scandals, and the participation of our voting public will continue to decline, to the extent that we will be embarrassed. It is close to that point now when, many times, only half of the people even bother to go to the polls. 
I ask that each Senator carefully consider the beneficial effects that our amendment will have and support us in moving this debate forward.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I have known my good friend from Washington for 30 years, I guess. He is a master of the facts. Let us take a look at one of the glaring examples of that in his dissertation. 
He takes a case involving the NAACP during the 1950s, when we had huge racial unrest, and the Supreme Court, in examining the case to expose all of the members of the NAACP in the South, said, when you have a paramount interest here of protecting people from bodily harm, then there is no way that you can require them to expose their membership so that you can go beat them up. This is a paraphrase. 
In Buckley--someone raised that issue in this case--it said no. We are talking about different rights. We are talking about the rights of the public and the sacred right of casting a vote to know all of the information that can be available to them when they make decisions. That is a vital right, a sacred right. So that right overcomes any concern about releasing the names. You have to know. The voting public can't make decisions if they hear all of this coming out of the air at them and they do not know who said it. 
So I don't think there is any question. But that is just an example of the erudite on constitutional law running through all of this, because I think this is clearly a situation where it is not in violation of the Constitution.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, there is an adage in the legal debate that when the facts and the law are not in your favor you tend to shout loudly and improperly about irrelevant principles of free speech. 
The opposition has done a masterful job on that. The issue is simple. In an election, does the public have the right to have disclosed in a timely fashion who is paying for an attack ad attacking a candidate? It is a matter of right to the voter and the election process. It is a matter of fairness to the attack candidate. More correctly stated, does the attacker have a constitutional right not to disclose who they are? The answer is a clear no. The public yes, the attacker no.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I understand what my good friend from Kentucky is saying, but I remind everyone what the real issue is, and that is elections. We are talking about a system which has developed over the past couple of years which has seriously imposed upon us unfairness as far as candidates are concerned who find themselves faced with ads, and other areas of expression, to change the election. Why would they spend $135 million to $200 million unless it was successful? 
Let us get a real-life situation of what we are talking about. I have been in the election process for many, many years, and I know from my own analysis--and I think it probably is carried forward everywhere--that the critical time in an election to make a change in people's minds is the last couple of weeks. 
Basically, I find that probably of the electorate, only about 50 percent care enough about elections to even go. That is the average across the country. Of that 50 percent, probably half of them will make up their minds during the last 2 weeks. 
So you are out and have a well-planned campaign and everything is coming down to the end. You can go and find out what your opponent has to spend, and you can try to be ready to match that. And then whammo, out of the blue comes all these ads that are supposedly issue ads, but they are obviously pointed at positions that are taken by you saying how horrible they are. So these are within the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. 
What can you do about it? You cannot do anything. You cannot even find out who is running them, unless you are lucky and have an inside source in the TV and radio stations to tell you who it is. You cannot find out. There is no disclosure. 
The most important part of our amendment is just plain disclosure. If it is far enough in advance, 30 days before a primary and 60 days before a general election, at least you have time to get ready for it. If you know you are going to get all these ads coming, then you can reorder your priorities of spending. You can say, `Oh, my God, we have all this coming,' and you never know until it is all over. You are gone. You lose the election and you didn't know. The opposition comes forth with this barrage and you are totally helpless. 
What we do is not anywhere near what we would like to do in the sense of protection against this kind of thing, because I am sure they will find ways to get around it and feel they do not have to disclose. But it is so simple. 
What is wrong with disclosure? What is wrong, if somebody is going to spend a couple of million bucks in the election against you, with at least knowing what is coming and who it is coming from? That is all we are asking for. We don't say you can't do it. Another thing we do, as explained very well by Senator Snowe, is deal in a constitutional way with the money coming from the treasuries of corporations or money coming from the treasuries of unions by restricting that even more so they cannot even intervene within that last 30 to 60 days. But there are other ways, through PACs and other ways the money can be brought into the election process, but it would be disclosed to the FEC and you have the ability to understand what you are going to be facing. 
I cannot understand why anybody would be against this 
amendment. It makes such common sense. It doesn't do anything. It doesn't create anything except it requires people to disclose their intentions and also prohibits the use of the treasuries of the corporations and unions. There is nothing very dramatic about that as a change in the law. I really take serious issue with my good friend, the Senator from Kentucky, on the questions he raised. 
Are these ads effective? Yes, I have talked with consultants, and I know one consultant who ran a lot of these ads. Obviously, what they were trying to do was win an election for their person who they were trying to help. No evidence of connection, but the people who wanted the ads sent the money for this purpose to defeat a candidate, and they felt those ads turned around at least five elections that would not have been turned around if it were not for use of these funds with no way for the poor candidate who is facing it to understand who it is, how much money is going to be spent and where it goes. 
I want to give real-world situations we are involved with. What is so unfair about being fair and getting full disclosure? 
I commend my good friend from Maine with whom I have worked very closely. I must say, this amendment is weaker than I would like to see, but I think we have done all we can do under the Constitution. I commend her for the presentation she has given and for her effort to raise the visibility to the Nation of the serious problems we have with these so-called advocacy or issue ads. 
It has been my pleasure to work with her on this important endeavor, and today the Senate has the opportunity to enact real campaign finance reform. 
The amendment we offer succeeds where others have failed in bringing the two sides closer to a workable solution. Combined with the underlying McCain-Feingold legislation, this amendment will ensure that all parties are treated equally in the reformed campaign finance structure. 
As my record has shown, I have long been a supporter of campaign finance reform. I have sponsored a number of initiatives in the past and have worked actively to enact campaign finance reform. I have been reluctant to cosponsor the McCain-Feingold bill this time around because of my concerns in two areas which I have just been discussing. First, issue ads that have turned into blatant electioneering with no meaningful disclosure of the source of the attack; second, the unfettered spending by unions and corporations to influence the outcome of an election, especially close to elections, without the ability to identify the source. 
Disclosure--how in the world can you be against disclosure? 
The amendment Senator Snowe and I are proposing strengthens the McCain-Feingold bill in a fair manner. Maybe too fair. That is the only criticism I can find of it. 
Mr. President, the work that Senator Snowe and I, as well as many other Senators, have done to develop an acceptable compromise is squarely within the goals of those calling for full campaign finance reform. We have been brought to this point by the disillusionment of the electorate. People across this Nation have grown wary of the tenor of campaigns in recent years. This disappointment is reflected in low voter participation and the diminished role of individuals in electing their representatives. 
Our efforts to reform the financing of campaigns should begin to reinvigorate people to further participate in our democracy. I am ashamed at the voter turnouts across the Nation. I am a little bit less ashamed of Vermont which has one of the highest, but we all should be working to get fuller participation, closer to 60, 70, 80, 90 percent. 
The 1996 election cycle reinforces the desperate situation we face. During this campaign, more than $135 million was spent by outside groups not associated with the candidates' campaigns. These expenditures indicated to the public that our election laws were not being enforced and the system was out of control. Additionally, recent hearings in both the Senate and the House point to the need for serious reform. 
Senator Snowe has clearly outlined the content of our 
amendment. Our proposal boosts disclosure requirements and tightens expenditures of certain funds in the weeks preceding a primary and general election. The amendment provides disclosure of the funding sources for electioneering communications broadcast within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. 
The measure prohibits labor union or corporation treasury funds from being used for these electioneering broadcast ads 30 days before a primary or 60 days before a general election. These two main provisions should strengthen the efforts put forward by the proponents of reform. 
Of equal importance is what this amendment will not do, and that was gone into in very great detail. In fact, we have so many things we will not do that it sometimes concerns me if we have done enough. The amendment will not restrict printed material nor require the text or a copy of a campaign advertisement to be disclosed. 
The amendment does not restrict how much money can be spent on ads, nor restrict how much money a group raises. In fact, our amendment clearly protects the constitutional prerogatives while promoting reform in a system badly in need of change. We have taken great care not to violate the important principles of free speech. 
In developing the amendment, we have reviewed the seminal cases in this area, particularly the Buckley case. The Supreme Court has been most tolerant in the area of limiting corporate and union spending and enhancing disclosure rules. We also worked to make the requirements sufficiently clear and narrow to overcome unconstitutional claims of vagueness and overbreadth. 
I have long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that `Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.' That is what we are looking for here, just a little sunlight on some of the very, very devious types of procedures that are utilized to influence elections. 
Discloser of electioneering campaign spending will provide the electorate with information to aid voters in evaluating candidates for Federal office. As we have seen in the last few campaign cycles, ads appear on local stations paid for by groups unknown to the public. These ads reference an identified candidate with the result of influencing the voters. Giving the electorate the information required in our amendment will give the public the facts they need to better evaluate the candidates but, more importantly, evaluate what information they are receiving and whether it is biased or where it came from, to be able to at least check where it came from and make sure it did not come from Indonesia or China or some other place. 
Additionally, this disclosure, or disinfectant, as Justice Brandeis puts it, will also help deter actual corruption and help avoid the appearance of corruption that many feel pervades our campaign finance system. 
Delivering this information into the public purview will enable candidates, the press, the FEC and interest groups to ensure that Federal campaign finance laws are being obeyed. Our amendment will expose any corruption and help reassure the public that our campaign laws will be followed and enforced. 
The amendment will also prohibit corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to pay for electioneering communications in a defined period close to an election. 
By treating both corporations and unions similarly, we extend current regulation cautiously and fairly. This prohibition, coupled with the disclosure requirements, will address many of the concerns my colleagues from both sides of the aisle have raised on campaign finance reform proposals. This provision will help satisfy our goal of creating a fair and equitable campaign finance system. 
The amendment I am asking my colleagues to support will, hopefully, provide the additional momentum to bring this issue to closure. Although I am optimistic, I am not blind to the uphill battle we face in enacting appropriate change. I am encouraged by the fair and informative and productive debate we have had on campaign reform today. The proposal Senator Snowe and I are offering, built upon the McCain-Feingold legislation, should become law. 
I cannot conceive of how any legitimate objection can be made to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. It is a step forward to making sure that elections are fair, that the public knows who it is trying to influence the elections, and that they have the right to find out that information. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the students, journalist, coach and business that have been recently recognized for their achievements in women's sports by the University of Vermont Women's Center in collaboration with the YWCA of Vermont as well as the Women's Sports Foundation. The recipients were selected from a long list of nominations based upon their contributions and support for women's athletics. 
Sports play an integral role in the development of our children and help to bring communities together. By participating in sports, student athletes are exposed to a variety of situations that help to develop the skills they will need to succeed. As such, community support for these programs is of the utmost importance. 
I am particularly pleased to see that the criteria for these awards included consideration of the students' academic performance, community involvement and leadership qualities. 
I am thrilled that these awards acknowledge the contributions made by coaches, journalists and local businesses as well. Each plays a critical role in promoting school athletics. Coaches provide students with mentorship while journalists supply the public recognition and businesses contribute financially. Without the assistance of each, Vermont's student athletes would not have the opportunity to excel that they enjoy today. 
In addition to the awards ceremony, the Professional Programs Division of Continuing Education hosted a teleconference for a number of recognized experts to discuss Title IX funding. Through our efforts in this field, significant progress has been achieved in providing women athletes with improved opportunities and better recognition, as is evident in this year's Olympic games. 
Once again, I would like to congratulate this year's recipients and wish them luck in their future endeavors. Those recognized include:

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation with my colleague Senator Kennedy that will improve the implementation of the interim payment system to home health agencies established under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It is imperative that we protect access to care for our most vulnerable populations--the elderly and the disabled. While I support the move to a prospective payment system for home care under the Balanced Budget Act, the payment system designed for the interim period is proving to be an intolerable burden for the home health agencies that serve Vermont's Medicare beneficiaries. 
This bill would do two things to remove the current threat to quality home care. First, the bill delays the implementation of the interim payment system for one year. This will minimize its impact on agencies as a prospective payment system is put in place. Second, the base year for establishing per patient limits will shift from the current designation of fiscal year 1994, to either fiscal or calendar year 1995. Care rendered in 1995 is a better reflection of the current mix of patients--and it captures the deterrent effect of Operation Restore Trust on fraud and abuse in areas where cost was inflated. 
My own State of Vermont is a good example of how the health care system can work to provide for high quality care for Medicare beneficiaries. Home health agencies are a critical link in the kind of health system that extends care over a continuum of options and settings. New technology and advances in medical practice permit hospitals to discharge patients earlier. They give persons suffering with acute or chronic illness the opportunity to receive care and live their lives in familiar surroundings. Time and time again, Vermont's home health agencies have proven their value by providing quality, cost-effective services to these patients. Yet time and again, federal policy seems to ensure that their good deeds should go punished. 
Furthermore, Vermont home health agencies have been able to provide quality service while consistently maintaining the lowest per capital reimbursement rates for home care in the country. The average Medicare payment per patient in Vermont is approximately $3,000 per year, one third lower than the national average, and far less than in high costs states where payments rise as high as $7,900 per patient per year. Now, Vermont agencies face a interim payment system established under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that is based on historical cost. Instead of being rewarded for their good work, Vermont agencies will have a much lower per patient limit under Medicare than agencies in high cost areas. According to a January 7 article in the Wall Street Journal, Vermont's 13 agencies could lose over $2 million next year by continuing to do what they always have done--providing efficient and essential services. 
Since the impact of the interim payment system became apparent, I have been in continuous contact with the Vermont Assembly of Home Health Agencies; the Vermont Agency of Human Services; and directors, trustees, employees, and patients of nearly every home health agency in the state. I firmly believe we must act to guard the health and welfare of a particularly vulnerable segment of the population. This legislation will help ensure that our home health care infrastructure is able to continue serving the patients that rely upon them.

Mr. JEFFORDS. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with one principal aim: to put an end to teenage smoking. I am honored to be joined by two other distinguished members of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator Collins, and Senator Enzi. 
By now, we are all familiar with the grim statistics that tell the story of youth smoking in our country--the thousands of children that experiment with tobacco, the thousands that become addicted, and the thousands who will die prematurely as a result. 
For too long, the federal government has been of little assistance in combating the number one preventable disease in this country. Apart from the efforts of Surgeons General from Luther Terry to C. Everett Koop, and sporadic efforts by Congress, the federal government has barely acknowledged there's a problem. 
The states, especially my home state of Vermont, have been leaders in the effort to end teenage smoking. And last summer, the proposed settlement by the Attorneys General ignited a whole new debate on this issue by providing us with a template for action. 
Eight months later, it is easy for us to minimize that accomplishment, but by any fair appraisal the settlement was a tremendously important step. 
When the tobacco settlement was announced, some people thought it might be only a few months before it would be ratified by Congress. Today, people wonder whether it can be revived by Congress. 
I am confident that we can and will reach agreement on a national tobacco policy. But I am just as certain that we'll never do so if we pursue a partisan approach. 
Since the settlement, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources has held four hearings on this subject, and across Capitol Hill dozens of hearings have been held by other committees of jurisdiction. 
Today we take the next important step in this process, by introducing legislation that I hope will serve as the basis for a broad, bipartisan approach to the three basic public health issues of a national tobacco policy: prevention, safer products, and cessation. 
If we can achieve a national tobacco policy, it could be the biggest public health breakthrough ever achieved outside a lab. 
The settlement has been criticized as being too weak by some, too ambitious by others. I agree the settlement has flaws. 
But I think we must never lose sight of the ultimate goal--what is the best public health approach that we can enact to reduce teen smoking? 
I am less concerned about exacting the last measure of revenge for the past actions of the tobacco companies than I am about ensuring the future of the children who become addicted every day. We need to keep our priorities straight. 
It will take a broad, bipartisan consensus to pass tobacco legislation. Right now, that consensus seems entirely absent and is in danger of slipping into partisan grand standing over who loves kids and hates tobacco. 
That consensus can only come through compromise. There will be many opportunities to derail legislation of this magnitude if it is only supported by a slim majority. If we expect enactment, we must forge broad agreement in the Congress. 
The legislation we introduce today, called the Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens, or PAST Act, will enact and improve upon the public health provisions of the tobacco settlement. It is not designed to solve every question before us, rather, it addresses the public health issues that are before the Labor Committee. 
It is no longer feasible for tobacco to escape the same type of regulation we require for foods and medicines. Our bill will give the Food and Drug Administration every bit of authority it needs to regulate tobacco products and their components. The tobacco industry will have to turn over all of its health documents to the FDA. FDA will be able to reduce or eliminate harmful ingredients or require safer technological improvements through informal rulemaking to achieve overall public health benefits. 
Of course, we will not achieve the public health benefits we seek from mandating safer products if the resulting products are unacceptable to consumers who can't quit smoking. Part of the process for setting these standards will be consideration of just this question. 
We encourage the development of safer products subject to the same type of scientific review for other FDA regulated products. And FDA can propose, after ten years, the outright prohibition of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products. 
But our bill will not permit FDA to ban cigarettes or smokeless tobacco for adult usage on its own. That decision, in my opinion, is one that should be made by Congress, not a single government agency. 
Our bill adopts a comprehensive approach to preventing teens from smoking, and helping people to quit who are already hooked. And finally, our bill will provide for a coordinated regime to research the many unanswered questions about tobacco, its effects on us, and how to mitigate those effects. 
I ask unanimous consent that a summary of our bill be included at the end of my remarks. 
Next week, Senator Gregg and I will hold a hearing in New Hampshire to listen to state and local concerns on tobacco issues within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. And in a month, I hope to have found bipartisan support for my bill and to have moved it through the committee. 
Finally, I want to note that many of my colleagues are also working on legislation to help move the discussion forward, and there are many good ideas that deserve consideration. In particular, I look forward to working with Senator Enzi on his proposal to establish a fund supported by tobacco industry resources. This fund would be a sustainable way to provide compensation for treating tobacco-related diseases, and could also be used to pay for some of the prevention proposals I have outlined in my bill 
Even though we have much work to do before we decide the overall architecture of tobacco policy, it is not at all too soon to begin pouring the foundation. As in New England, we have a short building season. If we are to clear the committees, combine our approaches, clear the floor and conference, we must act now. I urge my colleagues to give me their support, and greatly appreciate those who have already done so. 
We need to make teen smoking a thing of the past.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I want to thank my good friend for allowing me to do this. 
Mr. President, this is one of the relatively few times in the Senate when we have had a cloture motion on a nomination. 
I want to remind everyone of the fine, fine man that we are voting on here today. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture, and then to confirm Dr. Satcher. 
When we opened this debate last week, I stated that Dr. Satcher's record of service to the people of the United States was exemplary. I noted that his character and integrity were absolutely without blemish. Nothing has been said over the past two days that has challenged these assertions. Not even Dr. Satcher's critics question his professional qualifications to serve in the positions for which he has been nominated. 
Senators Frist and Thompson, and others, have already spoken eloquently about Dr. Satcher's commitment and integrity. They described the unprecedented support Dr. Satcher enjoys within the medical community, the public health community, and the research community. They have also described firsthand their own experiences working with the nominee to address public health issues in the State of Tennessee. 
I wish to associate myself with their remarks and to urge my colleagues to support Dr. Satcher's nomination. I know of no reason why we should not vote for cloture, and then support Dr. Satcher. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, if any.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of nomination of Dr. David Satcher to serve our nation as Surgeon General and as Assistant Secretary for Health. Dr. Satcher is a well-respected physician and medical researcher who has devoted his career to serving the Nation's public health. 
I want to note at the outset that it is relatively unusual for one person to be nominated to fill two such significant positions at the same time. When I reviewed the history of these positions, however, I learned that there is a historical precedent. From 1977 to 1981, Dr. Julius B. Richmond served ably in both positions. I believe that by combining these responsibilities we will better serve the needs of the nation. 
Dr. Satcher has demonstrated the kind of commitment to serving our Nation's public health that will be required to faithfully fulfill these responsibilities. At a time when many physicians and policy makers failed to appreciate urban health care needs, he began his career serving low-income and other disadvantaged patients in neighborhood health centers and urban hospitals. In 1982 he became President of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Meharry Medical College has trained more African American physicians than any other medical school in the country. 
In 1993, Dr. Satcher became the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention where he has served with distinction the past four years. Under his leadership, CDC has placed greater emphasis upon the prevention of disease. He has worked to increase childhood immunization rates from 55% to 78%. 
As a result, the incidence of vaccine-preventable childhood diseases has been reduced to its lowest level ever and three vaccine preventable diseases have been entirely eliminated. 
In addition, participation in CDC's comprehensive breast and cervical cancer screening program has expanded from 18 to 50 states. As a result of this initiative, more than 1.2 million women have received screening, over 2900 women with breast cancer have been identified and referred for treatment and over 21,000 women with an early treatable stage of cervical cancer have been identified and referred for treatment. 
Dr. Satcher also used his leadership to dramatically upgrade CDC's ability to detect and respond to new infectious diseases and foodborne illnesses. As a result, CDC played a lead role in responding to the outbreak of Salmonella in Oregon that was caused by contaminated food, and was responsible for the efforts to contain the multi-state outbreak of Cyclospora resulting from consumption of contaminated raspberries that threatened the health of thousands of children. Dr. Satcher's efforts lay the groundwork for the development of a new early warning system for infectious disease and foodborne illness that promises to save thousands of American lives each year. 
Dr. Satcher will need to draw heavily upon all of this commitment and experience to master the challenging duties for which he has been nominated. The Surgeon General occupies the `bully pulpit' of public health and is charged with the responsibility to protect the health of the Nation through public education. 
The Surgeon General must advocate for effective disease prevention and health promotion programs and must serve as a powerful symbol of our national commitment to protecting and improving the Nation's health. Dr. Satcher's legacy at CDC demonstrates his fitness to fulfill these responsibilities. 
The position of Assistant Secretary for Health is a position of equal importance. The Assistant Secretary serves as the Secretary's senior advisor for public health and science. In this capacity, Dr. Satcher will be required to provide Department-wide leadership in the application of sound medical and scientific principles to public health. In addition the Assistant Secretary for Health has direct responsibility for several key public health initiatives. 
These include: Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Emergency Preparedness, HIV/AIDS Policy, International & Refugee Health, Minority Health, Research Integrity, Women's Health, Population Affairs, and Physical Fitness & Health. 
Dr. Satcher's particular challenge will be to preserve the independence of the Surgeon General while fulfilling the Assistant Secretary's responsibilities to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
Dr. Satcher has revealed a profound understanding of the importance of these two positions and pledged to me that he will rely upon science and common sense rather than politics to guide his decision making. 
Dr. Satcher enjoys unprecedented and overwhelming support from within the medical and public health community. I believe that Dr. Satcher is eager to continue his efforts on behalf of the nation's public health and that he will fulfill his responsibilities faithfully. I urge my colleagues to support this nomination. 
Mr. President, we did a thorough examination of the history and of the work of Dr. Satcher, and we too looked into some areas that may be of controversy. But, in conclusion, after that thorough investigation, I have absolutely no reason not to stand before you and do all I can to make sure that his nomination is approved. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my friend from Missouri. I was disturbed about these matters, as he was, when I initially looked into the background of Dr. Satcher. These were fully investigated. They were answered in detail by the nominee. The record of those requests, involvement in these particular issues--the two most dramatic ones being perhaps the so-called free needles, clean needles, and also the AZT trials--the answers to those interrogatories are a matter of record and available to all Senators. In addition to that, they are on the Internet so the public can freely look into them. 
Let me very briefly give you an idea of the nature of the situation. The Senator referred to the New England Journal of Medicine. That would give you considerable credibility. But you should know that two members of the editorial board who were familiar with the AZT trials, which were in Africa, and were familiar with the methodology used resigned from the board as a result of that journal editorial. They understood. And I will go into length later on these trials, but I do not desire to do so now. 
Also, the question of needles and drugs is a matter of AIDS as well, AIDS prevention, and therefore when you understand fully the issue you will understand that this is a defensible way to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
But with that brief discussion, I will yield to my good friend who has been so very helpful on my committee, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist. 
Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his very excellent words about the nominee, Dr. Satcher, as we work in order to, hopefully, bring about his confirmation. 
I would like to make a few comments while we wait and see if someone else is ready to talk. 
I think it is important to briefly go through, and I am going to do it again another time with perhaps a little visual presentation of what we are talking about when we talk about the AZT trials and the responsibility of Dr. Satcher and Dr. Varmus, who is the head of NIH. 
We are talking about trials which were designed in Africa, by Africans, for Africans, after the review of many boards and groups that were working toward a solution to this problem. We are not talking about trials in the United States. Those of you who have visited Africa know the incredible AIDS epidemic that is going on in those nations. We think we have a problem here. The problems in the African nations where there is some evidence that the AIDS epidemic started--there are millions of pregnant women who are in danger of transmitting HIV to their children--are unimaginable. 
The question was, how do you handle that situation? It was decided by doctors and health officials in the host countries that they had to design some sort of a treatment protocol where they would know what would happen when they administered certain doses of drugs. So what they did--out of the huge pool of HIV infected pregnant women--was invite a group of them to participate in this trial. 
They invited these women--who were not going to receive any treatment for their HIV infection--and they said to them that, `We would like you, if you are willing, to participate in our trial; some of you will get medicine which might help your baby, some of you will receive a sugar pill. You may stop participating in this trial anytime you want. The only way we can determine whether the medicine is safe for you and your baby, however, is to do it in this way.' 
So it is not a question of whether these HIV infected pregnant women had an alternative to go out and get help someplace else. They did not. Participation in this trial was the best hope for getting any treatment that might prevent them from giving HIV to their babies. Not only that, most of these women were not in a situation, for instance, where they could have used the 076 regimen even if it had been made available as part of the drug trial. They could not buy infant formula; thus, they ended up having to nurse anyway. The 076 regimen requires that women give up nursing. 
There are a lot of differences--differences in culture and differences in circumstances--between here and in Africa. The host countries and the international organizations involved discussed all of these issues and finally agreed on this regimen for testing. They did so because they believed it provided the greatest hope for their own people. 
Now they get criticized because these pregnant women who would never have gotten any help were invited to participate in a trial where they might get some help. They are criticized for doing this, because the participants didn't know whether they would receive the medicine or the sugar pill. It is a difficult situation, but it can be misleading if you don't understand the dynamics of the situation which the various countries were facing. 
I hope as we go forward to make an additional point to my colleagues--and I am going to try to explain this a little more articulately and specifically later. The heads of CDC and NIH were separated a long, long ways from what was going on, and they had all sorts of review boards and organizations approving this regimen. It is not like Dr. Satcher and Dr. Varmus were over there in Africa conducting these trials. It was something that Dr. Satcher and Dr. Varmus have responsibility for as leaders of CDC 
and NIH, but certainly the design was something which came about by virtue of the many U.S. and international organizations trying to figure out how to take care of this terrible epidemic and how to, hopefully, save as many of the young babies as they can from being infected. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, winter is only half over, and even though there has been some stormy weather here in the Nation's Capital, sections of the Northeast experienced the ice storm of the century, maybe the millennium, earlier this month. For 2 days straight, freezing rain, snow and sleet battered the Champlain Valley of Vermont, upstate New York and parts of New Hampshire, Maine and the Province of Quebec. 
Tens of thousands of trees buckled and shattered under the stress and weight of several inches of ice that coated their branches. Power lines were ripped down by falling branches and the weight of the ice, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without electricity for days and even weeks. In fact, some are still without electricity. Roads were covered with ice and rivers swelled and overflowed with heavy rain. The crippling ice storm brought activity in the area to a grinding halt. 
Just a few days after the storm, Senator Leahy and I visited the hardest hit areas of Vermont. The storm's damages were the worst I have ever seen. In the Burlington area, 20 to 25 percent of the trees in that city were toppled or must be chopped down. Another 25 percent were damaged. The storm also destroyed sugar bushes and dropped trees across hiking trails and snowmobile trails. 
Mr. President, local and State emergency officials acted quickly to help their fellow Vermonters and to assess the damage. Soon after the storm, the President declared six Vermont counties a disaster. The response from FEMA was impressive, and I thank Director James Witt for standing behind Vermont. 
Vermonters rallied, with the help of the National Guard, led by Adjutant General Martha Rainville, to help themselves and their neighbors. 
As the temperatures dropped below zero days after the storm, with thousands still without power, volunteer firefighters, police officers and National Guard troops and every able-bodied citizen came together working day and night to help feed, heat and care for the people in their community. 
Hardest hit were dairy farmers. Already struggling to make ends meet due to low milk prices, the ice storm left farms without power to milk their cows. Cows need to be milked twice a day every day. At times, cows went for hours and even days without being milked. Fortunately one of the missions of the National Guard was to get power generators to farms and to keep them running so that farmers could milk their cows and keep their milk cool and preserve the health of the cows. 
One unit of the National Guard became known as the `Mobile Milking Team'--or the MMT, as is usual in the military sector to have acronyms--by going farm to farm with their generators. However, despite the efforts to bring generators to farmers, for many the damage was already done. Because the margins are already so close for many farmers, the loss of a single milk check could mean staying in business or selling out. 
Mr. President, the organized and volunteer responses to this disaster were incredible. The Vermont Petroleum Association, in conjunction with Mobile Oil and R.L. Vallee Petroleum, came to the aid of the farmers and the homeowners who were relying on their generators to run their businesses and to heat their homes by graciously donating 8,000 gallons of diesel fuel. 
Stories of Vermonters helping Vermonters were commonly told throughout the disaster counties in the State. Utility companies worked long hours in the cold to help clear debris and restore power. Lines men and women came from as far away as Hawaii to help repair the damage. Let me tell you, the ones from Hawaii had an adventure they will never forget. 
Vermonters also helped their neighbors to the north just across the Canadian border. Two weeks after the storm first hit, over 700,000 citizens in the Providence of Quebec were still without power and over 30,000 people were relying on meals from local food shelves. I teamed up with Cabot Creamery and H.P. Hood to help get 20,000 pounds of cheddar cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese and 1,000 cases of water so necessary through the many restrictions at the border to help feed the Canadians who were driven from their homes. Many Vermonters helped by sending firewood and heating oil. Thousands of cords of wood were shipped over. 
Mr. President, the citizens and trees of Vermont as well as upstate New York, Maine and New Hampshire have suffered enough from this storm. Local and State assistance will help communities and individuals get back on their feet. But Federal relief is needed to ensure that the disaster areas are not overwhelmed by their recovery. 
I know I speak for Senator Leahy and my colleagues from New York, Maine and New Hampshire when I say we all will do what we can to help. We look forward to the coming spring. But before the arrival of warm weather, months of hard work to restore Vermont to its pristine beauty is needed. And we will all be helping, I assure you. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators DeWine, Kennedy, Wellstone, Harkin, Frist, Collins, Chafee, and Reed in introducing the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. We began the process of drafting this bipartisan, consensus-based legislation shortly after completing the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Just as we sought the assistance of the disability community and professionals who serve individuals with disabilities in determining the direction we took in drafting the IDEA legislation, so we did with this bill. Just as we welcomed the assistance of the Administration in drafting the IDEA legislation, so we did with this bill. 
As a result, this legislation will open up more employment opportunities to individuals with disabilities. It will also provide State vocational rehabilitation agencies and others who provide employment-related assistance to individuals with disabilities with the tools they need to provide appropriate, timely help to individuals with disabilities who want to work. The combination of the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA and this reauthorization brings us closer to a seamless system in which parents of children with disabilities will envision and expect greater opportunities for their children to have productive and satisfying lives as adults. 
The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1997 will increase opportunities for individuals with disabilities to prepare for, secure, maintain, and regain employment by linking vocational rehabilitation services to those services that are available under current State workforce systems and those that will be available under the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997. It will simplify access to vocational rehabilitation services and streamline the administration of the vocational rehabilitation program. It makes additional improvements in discretionary programs related to personnel training, research, and demonstration projects and consumer-controlled Centers for Independent Living. It provides greater access to information technology. The reauthorization will extend through fiscal year 2004. 
The bill includes extensive links between vocational rehabilitation agencies and State workforce systems. For example, amendments related to linkage are found throughout the bill in sections pertaining to the findings and purposes of the legislation, definitions, program administration, reports, information dissemination, and State plan requirements, including those concerning data reporting. Complementary and parallel provisions to promote linkage between vocational rehabilitation agencies and State workforce systems also are included in the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997. 
The bill makes important changes in title I of the Act. The State plan requirements have been rewritten to simplify administration of the vocational rehabilitation program and reinforce its intent, helping individuals secure employment. The amendments reduce the 36 State plan requirements in current law to 24 and require the submission of one State plan, with amendments 
thereafter under certain circumstances. The bill allows, when a State is operating under an order of selection, for core services to be available to individuals with disabilities who do not meet a State's criteria for full services from the vocational rehabilitation agency. The legislation gives vocational rehabilitation agencies the ability to secure financial support from other entities who could or should pay for certain services needed by an individual with a disability, who is being assisted by the vocational rehabilitation agency to prepare for or secure a job. The bill requires State vocational rehabilitation agencies and State Rehabilitation Councils to jointly develop and conduct a comprehensive needs assessment every three years. Based on such an assessment, they will annually set and report on progress in achieving employment goals set for individuals with disability. The bill simplifies procedures for establishing eligibility, by requiring consideration of existing evaluating information in determining an individual's eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services. The bill strengthens eligible individuals' roles in developing their individualized rehabilitation employment plans. Such individuals will be given greater flexibility in how they develop their plans. The amendments give all States dollars for inservice training, and State allotments for training dollars will increase with increases in the Consumer Price Index. The bill requires that voluntary mediation be available for resolving disputes between vocational rehabilitation agencies and individuals with disabilities. 
The bill selectively amends other titles in the Rehabilitation Act. Title II, which authorizes the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, is amended to require that all funding priorities of the Institute be derived from a five-year plan that will be subjected to public comment and then submitted to Congress. The bill expands the authority of the Institute to allow funding of initiatives related to the quality assurance of assistive technology and the effectiveness of alternative medicine when used to treat individuals with disabilities. The legislation streamlines and updates title III of the Act, which authorizes training and demonstration activities, by clearly delineating funding priorities, simplifying the notification of interested parties about upcoming grant opportunities, and permitting funding for training of personnel in one-stop centers so that they will be more able to appropriately and effectively assist individuals with disabilities seeking employment-related assistance through such centers. 
With guidance from Senator Dodd, we strengthened the provisions in title V of the Act pertaining to the accessibility of electronic and information technology for individuals with disabilities by designating that the Access Board to write regulations and by requiring the Office of Management and Budget to oversee Federal agencies' compliance with such regulations. The legislation amends title VI of the Act by adding a new initiative, Projects in Telecommuting and Self-Employment for Individuals with Disabilities, and by permitting Projects with Industry to assist eligible individuals without waiting for referrals or eligibility status determinations from vocational rehabilitation agencies and to provide training and/or placement services. 
These amendments build on and complement those that were enacted in 1992. The 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act had a significant, positive effect in my State, Vermont. 
There, one out of every eight residents is disabled. The Division of Vocational Rehabilitation 
has enabled many Vermonters with disabilities to exercise the choices the 1992 amendments triggered, to become employed, and to live successfully in their communities. In 1996, Vermont's vocational rehabilitation program provided an array of services to almost 5,000 Vermonters, while directly assisting 850 individuals with disabilities to become successfully employed. 
The benefits of Vermont's efforts are many. Most important is the fact that Vermont consumers of vocational rehabilitation services who secure employment enjoy an average increase in income exceeding $8,000 per year. Seventy-three percent of these individuals enter the workforce earning more than minimum wage. Seventy-eight percent of those Vermonters who were assisted by the Vermont Division of Rehabilitation in 1996 remain employed today. In addition, the Vermont Consumer Choice Project, made possible by the 1992 amendments, has allowed my State to create organizational structures, policies and practices that have resulted in a greater degree of informed choice for individuals seeking and receiving vocational rehabilitation services. 
The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998 truly reflect a team effort by committed Senators, their staff, Federal officials, individuals with disabilities, rehabilitation professionals and others who know through experience that for individuals with disabilities, as for other individuals, having a job and liking it are the bottom line. Through these amendments we have secured and extended that bottom line for individuals with disabilities--more jobs, better jobs--into the next century.

Mr. President, I compliment the Senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell for the excellent job they have done in shepherding the Foreign Operations appropriations bill along it's difficult journey. While I would have written some sections differently, I believe that on balance this is a reasonable product of compromise that advances the primary goals of U.S. foreign policy. 
I am, however, very disturbed to see that the compromise on U.N. funding that was contained in the State Department authorization bill has now been dropped. While I was not pleased with some aspects of the Helms-Biden compromise, at least it provided a way to start meeting our obligations to the United Nations. 
I am disturbed, Mr. President, that greater thought has not been given by those who oppose this provision to the timing of this move. We are teetering on the brink of hostilities with Iraq over Saddam Hussein's refusal to allow entry to American members of the U.N. weapons inspection team. The United Nations has insisted that the integrity of its teams be respected and Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to pick and choose who he lets in. Last week, Secretary General Kofi Annan sent a three-member delegation to Iraq to impress upon Saddam Hussein the necessity of complying with United Nations requirements on access for inspectors. Unfortunately, they came away empty handed. But the United Nations Security Council continues to meet daily in an effort to counteract Iraq's intransigence. 
I think most of my colleagues realize that this would be a very inappropriate time to suddenly be forced to go it on our own. We may decide at some point that unilateral action against Iraq is the most appropriate, but that should only come after careful consideration of all policy options available to us. And quite frankly, Mr. President, I believe that some of our best options involve working closely with our allies and our friends in the Arab world to present a united front to Saddam Hussein. With all its warts, the United Nations is still the best mechanism for consulting quickly with all the parties involved and negotiating possible courses of action. This is always a difficult task, but it would be made many times more difficult if we were not able to work through the United Nations. While nothing in the legislation before us today says we must pull out of the United Nations, the refusal of a small number of members to let a broadly agreed-upon package of reforms and arrearage payments move forward is a de-facto renunciation of the United Nations just as we are again turning to that body for assistance in keeping one of the world's worst scofflaws in line. 
Getting other nations to join us in these efforts takes carrots and not just sticks. Our diplomats need to bring more to the table than the threat of military retaliation. That should be our last resort, and not before. If we are not willing to put our money where our mouth is at the United Nations, how can we expect Saddam to take our threats seriously? 
I know that efforts are underway at this very moment to reverse this unfortunate decision by the House of Representatives. And I hope they succeed. Not just today, but increasingly in the future, we are going to need more tools of diplomacy at our disposal, not fewer. I urge my colleagues in the House to take this into account before it is too late.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and great Vermonter, Herbert Cohen. Herbert died unexpectedly on July 27, 1997 at the age of 67. 
A respected entrepreneur in Rutland, Herbert owned and operated Vermont Contract Furnishings along with his wife Sandy. His business focused on interior designs for the condominium and vacation home markets. Accordingly, he was selected to provide these services for the 1980 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid. 
Herbert was a member of the board for Rutland's Regional Medical Center and was selected to act as president for the local Chamber of Commerce. In recognition of his outstanding achievements and dedication to the people of Vermont, Herbert was named `Citizen of the Year' in 1987. 
Herbert played an integral role in Rutland's revitalization. Through his efforts in restoring one of the areas most prominent storefronts, Herbert has left a lasting impression upon residents and visitors alike that will be slow to fade. 
Mr. President, I would like to extend my condolences to his family and friends.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on November 9 the Senate adopted Conference Report 105-399, that accompanied S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. This legislation puts into place long-needed reforms in FDA's regulatory procedures and also reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 [PDUFA] for an additional 5 years. 
The original PDUFA has brought faster reviews of drug applications. By all accounts the success is due to the underlying collaboration and partnership between FDA and the developers of innovative new medicines in using the fees paid by industry to bring the necessary review resources to bear on applications for new drugs. The 1992 act did not set the performance goals for activities funded by user fees into the law. Rather, these performance goals were set forth in a side-letter from the administration to the chairs and ranking members of the House Commerce and Senate Labor and Human Resources committees. These performance goals in the side-letter have stood the test of time--FDA has honored and met these goals as if they were in statute. Based on that experience, the Congress has agreed to use this approach again in establishing the performance goals for drug reviews funded by user fees over the next 5 years. 
Today, I am submitting for the Record a letter addressed to me and signed by Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, dated November 12, 1997. This letter specifies the performance goals for the use of PDUFA fees for fiscal years 1998 through 2002. These goals, which were agreed to at the conclusion of negotiations between FDA officials and pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry representatives, are those referred to in section 101(4) of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that the next 5 years will see reductions in the drug development time, as well as further reductions in the time taken to actual review an applications.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the bill before us is a remarkable achievement. It not only represents a true bipartisan effort to change a system that too often becomes mired in bureaucracy, but it also represents a significant change in the way that system works and what its goals should be. I am very proud to have played a part in negotiating a good bill, and I want to commend, in particular, my colleagues Senator Chafee, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Coats, and Senator Craig for their hard work on this bill. I also want to thank Senator Roth for his efforts in negotiating this legislation with our House counterparts. 
This legislation will lead to an improvement in the services we provide to nearly 100,000 children in the foster care system who are unable to return to their biological families because of threats to their health and safety. This bill guarantee as never before that their health and safety will be the `paramount concern' at every step of their stay in foster care, including in the development of their permanency plan. It also assures that every effort will be made to move children into safe, permanent homes as quickly as possible. 
Why is this important? Too often, children languish in foster care for years--years--before they find a safe, loving family. Many children, especially those with special needs, often never are placed with an adoptive family. Those children grow up in the foster care system, never knowing the security and warmth that a loving family provides. 
To help ensure that the child's safety remains the paramount concern, this bill changes the focus on the way states define the term `reasonable effort.' Too often, states have placed too much emphasis on returning a child to his or her biological family, even when doing so may mean endangering the child. This bill provides that states should still make every attempt to keep families intact, but--and this is a significant change in the current law--it also makes it very clear that there are a number of circumstances in which a state does NOT have to make a reasonable effort to reunite a child with the biological family. For example, if a parent has been found to have murdered another child in the family, or has subjected a child to chronic abuse, it is unreasonable--and irrational--to insist that the state return that child to the family. That seems like common sense, but, as we all know, the law doesn't always lead to common sense conclusion. This legislation clarifies this. 
I also want to point out that this bill requires, for the first time, states to implement procedures by which they will perform criminal background checks on potential foster and adoptive parents. I think the average citizen would be very surprised to learn that we do not currently require states to do such checks. While some states check prospective adoptive parents for evidence of past criminal activity which might indicate that it would be dangerous to place a child in their care, most states do not. This bill would change that situation. The original House bill did not contain this provision, and I want to commend the Senate conferees, especially Senator Coats, for insisting the Senate's language remain intact. It makes good sense. 
Another hard-fought provision that the Senate can be very proud of provides that when a special needs child is adopted--that is, one who is hard to place because of a physical or mental disability--then the state must ensure that the child will have health insurance coverage. Too many of these special needs children have found that when they are adopted, their access to health care disappears and the adoptive family must shoulder the entire financial responsibility for the child. That can create a huge disincentive for an otherwise loving family to adopt a child with a physical disability. Our bill says that when a child is adopted, he or she will have the health insurance needed to meet his or her needs. That is a significant step, and, again, I am pleased the Senate remained steadfast in its insistence on this provision. 
Mr.. President, this bill is a victory for children and adoptive parents nationwide. There are more than 100,000 children awaiting adoption or other permanent placements, and this bill is a good step toward moving many of them into safe, loving, permanent homes. 
Again, I extend my deepest thanks to Senators Chafee, Rockefeller, Craig, Coats, DeWine, Kerrey, and Roth for their hard work on this bill. We have been working to come to this agreement for months, and this bill is the hard-fought result of those efforts. I urge all my colleagues to give their support to this legislation.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and great Vermonter, Henry Carris. Henry died on June 25, 1997, at the age of 85. As founder of Carris Reels, a nationally recognized enterprise, Henry was the epitome of everything that is good about business. 
He understood the importance of appreciating his good fortune and giving something back to the community. Henry was an active advocate for improved educational opportunities in the Rutland area. Accordingly, he served on the Rutland School Board and was instrumental in developing the Rutland Area Art Association. 
In addition, Henry was a member of the board for Rutland's Regional Medical Center and was selected to act as president for the local chamber of commerce. In light of his outstanding achievements and dedication to the people of Vermont, Henry was named `Man of the Year' for Rutland and `Citizen of the Year' for the State. 
At a ceremony recognizing his achievements, he stressed the importance of family and friends. Henry clearly understood the secrets to success and was more than willing to share the wealth of his wisdom. 
For those of us who had the good fortune to know him, Henry Carris' energy and enthusiasm left an indelible impression. He exemplifies what all of us should strive to achieve. I would like to extend my condolences to his family and friends.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and great Vermonter, Gerald T. `Giggy' Lloyd. After 40 years of dedicated service as fire chief for Rutland, VT, Giggy retired this summer. 
Giggy's memorable career has been spent protecting the people of Vermont against fires. However, his concern about safety extends beyond the people he protects. He is also concerned about the safety of the people in his department. After 13 years as fire chief, Giggy has accomplished many remarkable tasks. When he first became fire chief in 1985, his first concern was for the members of his department. He set out to improve their equipment and better train the employees to protect them against harm, and he has accomplished that task. Since Giggy has been fire chief, there have been no serious injuries within the department. Giggy's dedication and concern for others is an outstanding example for everyone to follow. 
Giggy has extended himself beyond being fire chief as well. He became the city's fire prevention officer in 1976 and worked tenaciously to increase the use of safety features such as smoke alarms and fire resistant doors. 
Giggy Lloyd has courageously committed his life to protecting the people of Vermont, and he is the finest example of Vermont 's commitment to excellence. Once again, I would like to extend my best wishes on Giggy Lloyd's retirement and congratulate him on a job well done.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to J. Fred Carbine. Fred died this summer at the age of 59. I had the honor of knowing Fred both as a partner and a friend. He will be remembered as much for his professional accomplishments as for his humor. 
Fred began his memorable career after passing the bar in 1962. He served as a Rutland County grand juror and was the first assistant clerk for the Vermont House of Representatives from 1963 until 1968. Fred then filled a seat on the board of aldermen until 1978, during which time he served as board president for 7 years. After his tenure as an alderman, he opened a law practice, at which I had the great pleasure of having him as a partner. 
Among his many interests, Fred was a member and governor of the Rutland Moose Lodge, for which he was awarded the order's highest degree in 1985. True to his nature, Fred gave a great deal back to his community. He worked with the Salvation Army, Knights of Columbus, and the Masonic Temple, among many others. 
Fred had a marvelous wit and a wonderful sense of humor. He loved to tell stories and always thought the best of everyone. 
Fred Carbine had many friends, and I consider myself lucky to be one of them. He was a brilliant lawyer and a wonderful man. I would like to extend my condolences to the family and friends of Fred Carbine.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate yesterday passed S. 537, the 5-year reauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards Act. The original statute, now 5 years old, passed in 1992 with broad bipartisan support. Through the tireless efforts of Senator Barbara Mikulski, the lead sponsor of the Mammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act, we will be able to continue this critical program for women's health. 
Prior to the passage of this legislation, breast tumors in women were often missed because of defective x ray equipment or inadequately trained personnel. Today, to operate lawfully, a mammography facility must be certified as providing quality mammography services. That means that a national uniform quality standard for mammography has been established. It requires that facilities use only properly trained personnel, establishes a control program to ensure the reliability, clarity, and accurate interpretation of the mammogram, and now each facility undergoes an annual inspection. 
Breast cancer is currently the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American women. One woman in eight will develop breast cancer during her lifetime, and, during the nineties, it is estimated that 500,000 women will die from the disease. If breast cancer is detected early, however, the probability that a woman can survive is greater than 90 percent. 
Currently, the most effective technique for early detection of breast cancer is mammography, an x ray procedure that can often locate small tumors and abnormalities up to 2 years before they can be detected by physical examination. However, mammography is one of the most technically challenging x ray procedures, and ensuring the quality of mammography services is difficult. To address concerns about variations in the quality of mammography service provided by the more than 10,000 facilities throughout the United States and its territories, the Congress passed the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992. 
This reauthorization continues an important program that gives the women of America and their families an assurance that the quality of services for this vital test has improved, and will, hopefully, encourage even greater numbers to take advantage of this life saving diagnostic tool.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, before us is the conference report on S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. This is really an excellent moment to bring this up and consider what has been accomplished. 
This bill represents the first major reform of the Food and Drug Administration in some 30 years. For our committee, it is the second major reform that we have accomplished this session, the first one being special education, which was the first major reform for that program in some 20 years. 
I am very pleased to be able to say to my colleagues that the FDA measure embodies the objectives we originally sought to accomplish. 
This legislation achieves two important goals. 
First, it helps the FDA to get medicine and medical devices to patients and doctors sooner and safer. 
And, second, it will extend and improve the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, commonly known as PDUFA. 
I am pleased to report that the conference report has the unanimous support of the conferees. It deserves the unanimous support of this body as well. 
The conference report is the culmination of 3 years of hard work by dozens of Senators. It offers the most substantial reform of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in decades and will have a positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans for decades to come. 
Think how the world of medicine has changed over the past two or three decades. The law that governs much of that world, and nearly $1 of every $3 spent by consumers, must change and adapt as well. 
The measure makes scores of changes in the law that ensures the safety of the food we eat, of the drugs we use to fight disease, and the medical devices we use to improve the health of Americans. It will help patients gain access to new therapies sooner without weakening either safety requirements or the authority of the FDA. It gives the agency needed tools and resources to manage an increasing workload more efficiently. In addition, it contributes to our maintaining America's technological leadership in producing pharmaceuticals and medical devices. 
Achieving these reforms is a win-win-win situation for consumers, for the FDA, and for manufacturers. It is a win for patients and consumers, who will gain access to previously unavailable information and obtain better therapy sooner. It is a win for the FDA, which will receive new, sorely needed resources and streamlining and modernization of bureaucratic processes that have not changed in decades. And it is a win for the manufacturers, who will have a certainty that the review and approval processes applied to their innovative products will be applied in a collaborative and consistent manner. 
About 10 months ago, Mr. President, we embarked anew on an effort that some characterized as foolish--an effort to modernize the regulatory processes of the FDA. Many thought it could not be done. Some urged we merely extend PDUFA or we tackle only a few issues related to drug regulation and leave the comprehensive modernization to another day. 
I am glad we did not choose either of these paths. Instead, we chose to forge a bill with broad, bipartisan support, one that took a broad view of the changes needed at the FDA. 
In that regard, I particularly want to acknowledge the Democratic members of the Labor Committee, and especially Senators Dodd, Mikulski, Wellstone, and Murray. They have made countless contributions to this legislation, large and small. Their tireless support has been critical in our success. 
This measure is the result of the process to consult with individuals of all points of view and to benefit from the expertise needed to craft legislation on this complex issue. Patients, 
physicians, consumer groups, the FDA, and the manufacturers of medical devices and pharmaceuticals all contributed to this effort through their participation in hearings and in discussions with the staffs. 
This effort was parallel to that of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, which, under the outstanding leadership of Chairman Bliley, also produced a strong bipartisan bill with overwhelming support. The collaboration and consensus building has continued right up to the present, and the quality of this conference report we are considering today reflects that process. 
Mr. President, we would not be here today if it were not for the effort of my predecessor as the chair of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kassebaum. Her efforts to advance reform in the last Congress paved the way for our work here today. We owe her an enormous debt. 
This year, there have been many Members in both Chambers who have contributed to this effort. Foremost among them has been Senator Coats. The list of provisions of this bill that bear his imprint is far too long to recite. But, as an example, the third-party review provision has been developed under his leadership, and he has played an important role in advancing FDA modernization throughout this process. 
Senator Gregg is to be commended for his proposals to streamline the FDA process for consideration of health claims based on Federal research and his amendments to establish uniformity for the over-the-counter, OTC, drugs and cosmetics. Senator McConnell also suggested improvements in the regulation of food. 
I am especially grateful to Dr. Frist. He and Senator Mack led the way to compromise on the issue of the dissemination of medical information to health professionals, an important advance forward. 
Senator DeWine, joined by Senator Dodd, offered an important amendment to establish incentives for the conduct of research into pediatric uses for existing and new drugs, a needed change. The bill was improved by Senator Hutchinson's amendment to establish a rational framework for pharmacy compounding, which respects the State regulation of pharmacy while allowing an appropriate role for the FDA. And Senator Harkin has made many contributions to this legislation. 
Finally, the ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, has played an important role in bringing this conference report to the floor in a manner that draws support from all quarters. 
In the House, Chairman Bliley and Congressmen Dingell, Burr, Burton, Greenwood and Whitfield have contributed immense energy and leadership in reaching this agreement. 
Mr. President, it has been a remarkable year, crowned by a remarkable, bipartisan achievement. And I thank my colleagues for their support. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, 
I would like to take a moment to thank the staff who have worked to make this bill possible. In the office of Senate Legislative Counsel, Robin Bates, Elizabeth Aldridge, and Bill Baird worked tirelessly to produce countless bill drafts and amendments. I would also like to commend House Legislative Counsels David Meade and Pete Goodloe for their work on the conference report. 
The staff at CRS, especially Donna Vogt, and at GAO, including Bernice Steinhardt deserve thanks for their willingness to provide essential information and documents on extremely short notice. 
The staff to the members of the committee contributed greatly to the success of this bill. Vince Ventimiglia with Senator Coats' staff worked closely with mine in a true partnership on all aspects of S. 830. 
In addition, Kimberly Spaulding with Senator Gregg, Sue Ramthun with Senator Frist, Saira Sultan with Senator DeWine, and Kate Lambrew-Hull with Senator Hutchinson all played important roles in fashioning compromises on key provisions of this conference report, as did Dave Larson and Barry Daylin. 
Similarly, three staffers for members of the minority on the committee played pivotal roles throughout the process--from the premarkup stage through the development of this conference report. Their assistance was critical to making this bill a bipartisan success. 
Lynne Lawrence with Senator Mikulski deserves special mention in recognition of her hard work both in the last Congress and in this one on FDA reform. Following passage of this conference report, Lynne will be leaving Capitol Hill. I am extremely pleased that she will be leaving on a high note, and we all wish her the best with future pursuits. Jeanne Ireland with Senator Dodd and Linda Degutis, a fellow with Senator Wellstone also provided invaluable assistance throughout the process. 
Finally, I thank, of course, the Labor and Human Resources Committee majority and minority staffs. On the minority staff, I would like to thank Nick Littlefield and David Nexon and two minority fellows Diane Robertson and Debbie Kochever. 
On my own staff, I would like to thank the majority staff director Mark Powden, Jay Hawkins, and majority fellow Sean Donohue. All have devoted substantial portions of their time over the past 10 months to this effort. 
Jay Hawkins, in particular, has been key to making this conference report a reality. His tireless efforts, his unfailing good humor, and his patience have allowed this process to maintain steady forward progress to a highly successful outcome. 
The round-the-clock work, particularly over the past few days, of all the staff involved in the conference is greatly appreciated.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Workers' Pension Protection Act. This legislation will level the playing field for millions of American workers who currently participate in defined benefit multiemployer pension plans. 
As I am certain many of my colleagues are aware, there is a difference between multiemployer and single-employer pension plans. Multiemployer plans are maintained by a specific union, and supported by the various employers that union has organized, whereas single-employer plans are established by one company for its own employees. Thus, the Central States Teamsters pension fund covers individuals who work for employers the Teamsters have organized in the Midwestern United States. By contrast, General Electric has its a single-employer plan, or plans, that it established for its own employees. 
This bill is only concerned with multiemployer pension plans. It protects workers' benefits by making sure that multiemployer plans are funded so that benefits promised today will be available when workers retire in the future. Many of this country's multiemployer pension plans are underfunded by billions of dollars. It is true that a plan can be underfunded by billions of dollars but the relationship of assets to liabilities can still be relatively high. However, we are looking at plans that are not only underfunded by large amounts, but also where liabilities seriously outstrip assets. 
This legislation both increases funding and reporting requirements on multiemployer plans, so that we know when plans are becoming riskier, and improves protections and benefits. American workers rely upon their pensions to support them through their twilight years. Unfortunately pension plans are not infallible and too often, the American workers discover that their plan is bankrupt and that all pension payments are now in the hands of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC], the Federal agency charged with insuring defined benefit pension plans. What these workers may not realize is that under a single-employer plan, up to $33,132 per year is protected by the PBGC's pension insurance, but under the multiemployer pension insurance system, they can only receive $5,850. My legislation will not completely eliminate this unfairness, but it will slightly more than double the amount payable by the PBGC, by increasing benefits from $5,850 to $12,780. This change in the guaranty benefit amount would be the first increase to those benefits since the multiemployer program was enacted in 1980. 
Next, this bill will require plans to fund their current pension promises before making new ones. Pension plan trustees would be unable to grant benefit increases if a plan is less than 95 percent funded. This provision is needed to keep underfunded 
plans from going deeper in the red if collective bargaining ignores the underfunding problem. 
Third, this legislation will require multiemployer pension plans to use single, identified interest rate and mortality table assumptions in all calculations. As in the single-employer pension plan reform legislation of 1994, the interest rates and mortality tables must be standardized and must conform to the most recent data available. With this change, plans may not use one set of numbers when reporting the level of funding in their plan to the PBGC, and another set of numbers when determining liability associated with a withdrawal from the plan. That amounts to manipulating interest rates to game the system. We require single-employer pension plans to use a specific interest rate and a mortality table. I believe it should apply to multiemployer plans, as well. 
Fourth, the bill will require that plan trustees notify participants, annually and in plain English, of how well or poorly funded their plans are. Once and for all, multiemployer pension plan participants and beneficiaries will have a chance to learn how secure--or insecure--their retirement benefits are. It is one thing to tell a plan participant what his or her expected benefit will be upon retirement. It is quite another to let a participant know that their pension plan could have 45 percent more in liabilities than it has in assets, or that it may have accumulated $5 billion in underfunding. 
The PBGC has told us that notification to participants of plan funding has worked well for single-employer plans. Since it has been a success for the single-employer insurance system, we should extend the same protections to participants in multiemployer plans. With a better understanding of the worth of their benefits, workers can make informed decisions about their retirement needs. I think such notification is a vitally important participant protection for multiemployer pension plan participants. 
Finally, the bill will increase premiums imposed by the PBGC upon sponsors of multiemployer pension plans. Currently, premiums are $2.60 per participant but they have not been increased since the multiemployer guaranty program was enacted in 1980. By contrast, the single employer premium has been increased by Congress eight times since ERISA was passed in 1974. The minimum premium for fully funded single-employer plans is now $19 per participant, but some underfunded plans are charged hundreds of dollars per participant for PBGC premiums. If we are going to raise multiemployer benefits, it is also time to raise multiemployer premiums. Over a 3-year period, my bill will double premiums, increasing them to $5.20 per participant. 
Mr. President, I realize that it is the end of the session. I am introducing this measure now in order to permit review and comment by interested parties in advance of hearings I will be holding on this issue next year. This bill takes modest, but overdue steps to protect participants of multiemployer pension plans. I hope that those concerned with the safety and security of, and equity in, multiemployer pension plans will not hesitate to step forward to be heard. There are slightly more than 1,800 multiemployer pension plans in this Nation providing benefits to approximately 8.7 million individuals. This bill protects those workers and retirees--and they need and deserve our oversight. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to join me in sponsoring this important piece of legislation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this week Senator Leahy and I addressed the Senate about our concerns and disappointment with the recent order by the U.S. District Court of Minnesota which enjoined the Secretary of Agriculture from enforcing class I differentials in 28 of the current 33 Federal milk marketing orders. If the November 3, 1997, ruling stands, it will throw the entire milk pricing system into chaos threatening the continued existence of thousands of dairy farms nationwide. 
Mr. President, it is imperative that Secretary Glickman move immediately to seek a stay and file an appeal to the court's decision. I am joining several of my colleagues in a letter to Secretary Glickman to formally request that the U.S. Department of Agriculture appeal the decision. I urge others to contact Secretary Glickman to recommend that he act swiftly in this request as well.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I enthusiastically join my colleagues in offering legislation that would allow wind and biomass energy to continue to advance as commercially viable renewable energy sources. This legislation will allow wind and biomass energy to play a competitive role in the growing domestic energy market. 
Through the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress established a mechanism to increase investments in new or emerging energy technologies. In 2 years, this credit will expire. Companies developing wind energy, who require a 2-3 year lead time for installing new wind machines, were not able to take advantage of the available credit before it expired. Congress should extend the credit program to allow continued efforts to increase production of electricity from wind and biomass. 
To date, significant progress has been made in the development of wind energy, and this industry is poised to further increase its production capacity. With support from Congress through research and development funding and tax credits wind energy has become more competitive and the technology has improved in designs and operation. Generation costs from wind have dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt hour in 1980 to a low of 7 cents per kilowatt hour today for wind power. Investments in new technological improvements will further reduce the cost of this energy source and will enable the industry to play a key role in the new competitive electric utility environment. 
Likewise, biomass energy technologies, which are derived from any plant material and some forms of animal waste, are continuously improving in performance and cost. 
Madam President, I want to emphasize the importance of using renewable energy to meet our growing demand for energy. Renewable energy is important for several reasons: First, it does not produce harmful, life-threatening pollution; second, it is capable of providing ample energy to meet the huge amount of demand that is forecasted; third, it increases our energy and economic security; and fourth, since more than 2 billion people in the world live without electricity, it creates jobs in the United States. 
I thank my colleagues for working with me to extend the credit program for producing energy from wind and biomass.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Quality Child Care for Federal Employees Act. This bill was drafted with an eye toward several serious incidents which occurred earlier this year in federal child care facilities. At that time, it came to my attention that child care centers located in Federal facilities are not subject to even the most minimal health and safety standards. 
As you know, Federal property is exempt from State and local laws, regulations, and oversight. What this means for child care centers on that property is that State and local health and safety standards do not and cannot apply. This might not be a problem if federally owned or leased child care centers met enforceable health and safety standards. I think most parents who place their children in Federal child care would assume that this would be the case. However, I think Federal employees will find it very surprising to learn, as I did, that, at many centers, no such health and safety standards apply. 
I find this very troubling, and I think we sell our Federal employees a bill of goods when federally-owned leased child care cannot guarantee that their children are in safe facilities. The Federal Government should set the example when it comes to providing safe child care. It should not be turn an apathetic shoulder from meeting such standards simply because State and local regulations do not apply to them. 
In 1987, Congress passed the Trible Amendment which permitted executive, legislative, and judicial branch agencies to utilize a portion of federally-owned or leased space for the provision of child care services for Federal employees. The General Services Administration [GSA] was given the authority to provide guidance, assistance, and oversight to Federal agencies for the development of children centers. In the decade since the Trible Amendment was passed, hundreds of Federal facilities throughout the Nation have established onsite child care centers which are a tremendous help to our employees. 
The General Services Administration has done an excellent job of helping agencies develop child care centers and have adopted strong standards for those centers located in GSA leased or owned space. However, there are over 100 
child care centers located in Federal facilities that are not subject to the GSA standards or any other laws, rules, or regulations to ensure that the facilities are safe places for our children. Most parents, placing their children in a Federal child care center, assume that some standards are in place--assume that the centers must minimally meet State and local child care licensing rules and regulations. They assume that the centers are subject to independent oversight and monitoring to continually ensure the safety of the premises. 
Yet, that is not the case. In a case where a Federal employee had strong reason to suspect the sexual abuse of her child by an employee of a child care center located in a Federal facility, local child protective services and law enforcement personnel were denied access to the premises and were prohibited from investigating the incident. Another employee's child was repeatedly injured because the child care providers under contract with a Federal agency to provide onsite child care services failed to ensure that age-appropriate health and safety measures were taken--current law says they were not required to do so, even after the problems were identified and injuries had occurred. 
As Congress and the administration turn their spotlight on our Nation's child care system, we must first get our own house in order. We must safeguard and protect the children receiving services in child care centers housed in Federal facilities. Our employees should not be denied some assurance that the centers in which they place their children are accountable for meeting basic health and safety standards. 
The Quality Child Care for Federal Employees Act will require all child care services located in Federal facilities to meet, at the very least, the same level of health and safety standards required of other child care centers in the same geographical area. That sounds like common sense, but as we all know too well, common sense is not always reflected in the law. This bill will make that clear. 
Further, this legislation demands that Federal child care centers begin working to meet these standards now. Not next year, not in 2 years, but now. Under this bill, after 6 months we will look at the Federal child care centers again, and if a center is not meeting minimal State and local health and safety regulations at that time, that child care facility will be closed until it does. I can think of no stronger incentive to get centers to comply. 
Now, just as there have often been difficulties with Federal facilities ignoring State and local standards simply because of a division of power between the Federal and State governments, so, too, do divisions in the Federal Government--what we call the separation of powers--help create chaos in enforcement at the Federal level. Who has oversight of the facilities in the Federal Government, and who is responsible for monitoring and enforcement? 
Mr. President, this legislation respects the separation of powers within the Federal Government, but it also makes it very clear where the oversight and responsibility for meeting health and safety standards lies. For the most part, centers located in agencies within the executive branch--within, for example, the Department of Veterans' Affairs--will retain responsibility for monitoring and ensuring compliance. For centers within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, including the Library of Congress, this responsibility will lie with the Architect of the Capitol or his designee. In the judicial branch, monitoring and compliance will fall under the jurisdiction of the Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The GSA will continue to monitor centers it owns and leases in the judicial and executive branches. The costs of this monitoring are already included in this year's appropriations bills and will not add to the deficit. 
It should also be made clear that State and local standards should be a floor for basic health and safety, and not a ceiling. The role of the Federal Government--and, I like to think, of the U.S. Congress in particular--is to constantly strive to do better and to lead by example. Federal facilities should always try to meet the highest possible standards. In fact, the GSA has required national accredition in GSA-owned and leased facilities, and has stated that its centers are either in compliance or are strenuously working to get there. This is the kind of tough standard we should strive for in all of our Federal child care facilities. 
Federal child care should mean something more than simply location on a Federal facility. The Federal Government has an obligation to provide safe care for its employees, and it has a responsibility for making sure that those standards are monitored and enforced. Some Federal employees receive this guarantee. Many do not. We can do better. 
I urge swift passage of this legislation, and thank my colleagues for their attention to this matter.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we move another step closer to preserving our Nation's passenger rail system. The desperate call for action signals the importance of rail travel and the severe impacts a shutdown of Amtrak would have on the daily lives of millions of Americans. 
We live in a nation that prides itself on independence. For many Americans, their personal automobile grants them the ability to travel unincumbered for work and pleasure. But as we all know, this freedom is slowly ebbing as our Nation's highways and skies become more and more congested. Our roadways and runways are at capacity and growth opportunities are severely limited. 
A drive through and around any major American city today will leave most drivers frustrated by delays. This constant automobile congestion slows commerce, reduces worker productivity, and limits travel independence. In fact, highway congestion now costs the United States $100 billion annually, not including the economic and societal costs of increased pollution and wasted energy. 
The American solution has been to find alternatives. Our road options are limited. Ten-lane highways cannot be expanded, and new highways are difficult to site and result in the destruction of irreplaceable land and neighborhoods. 
Congestion in the air is also a major issue. Slots at airports are filled. Runways are backed up. Air space is busy. A recent safety study reported that 21 of the 26 major airports experienced serious delays, costing billions of dollars. New airports are expensive and only add to the problems we face today. 
Rail remains the one underutilized infrastructure available to our Nation. Railroads offer us the opportunity to move cars off the highways and planes from the air. Rail is efficient, cheaper and more environmentally preferable than our other options. We must now begin the careful process of retaining and rebuilding passenger rail in our country. 
Created in 1970, Amtrak serves millions of passengers each year. For 10 million households that have no car, and many communities without air or bus service, Amtrak is their lifeline. Amtrak connects 68 of the 75 largest urban areas in the United States, and serves many of the 62 million Americans living in rural areas. 
According to the Journal of Commerce, without Amtrak there would be an immediate need for 10 new tunnels under the Hudson River between northern New Jersey and New York City and 20 new highway lanes in New York. If Amtrak disappeared tomorrow, there would be an additional 27,000 cars on the highway between New York and Boston every day. 
In my home State of Vermont, passenger rail has been rediscovered. We launched a new passenger service, the Ethan Allen Express last year, to complement the already existing Vermonter. Both trains have been immensely successful, brining passengers from New England, New York, and across the Nation to our beautiful State. These trains have relieved highway congestion, given an economic boost to the State and offer travelers an alternative to driving or flying. Our dream in Vermont is to expand this service, linking a number of our larger cities and reestablishing rail service to Maine, New Hampshire, and Boston. 
And as we learned last winter in Vermont, rail keeps rolling regardless of weather. During the deep winter storms, as cars were snowbound and planes held on the ground, the trains were bringing business travelers and skiers to our State. We all remember when the eastern seaboard was hit with a major blizzard in in the winter of 1996 and the Federal Government was shut down for a solid week. But Amtrak kept running. In fact, my only means of getting to the Senate that week was on the train, as roads were blocked an planes grounded. 
Passenger rail service is the future. But many in this city have yet to recognize this reality. Amtrak has never been given the proper tools to bring the train into the modern age. The rail system operates on 1930's technology, with outdated engines, cars and maintenance facilities. 
While this system struggles, other nation's have invested heavily in technologically advanced high speed trains. France, Japan, and many other nations operate state-of-the-art trains, an efficient mode of travel in densely populated regions. Japan installed their bullet trains in the early 1960's, and Europe in the 1970's. The high-speed trains, cruising at 200 miles per hour or more, easily compete with cars, buses, and planes. 
Why has the United States fallen so far behind? Railroads in this country once had the prestige and financial capital to do nearly anything, but that changed over the years. Through mismanagement and limited public support we let our passenger railroads decay to the point of extinction. Today, we face the same choices. Should we support reviving and expanding advanced passenger rail through public financing or shut the system down? Let's not make a mistake that we would truly regret in the future. It's time to make this railroad work and maintain its role as a vital component of our Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
This Nation is on the verge of one of the most important transportation developments in its history. High speed rail should be operational from Washington to Boston by 1999. Other regions of the country are also working to develop high-speed train service, including California, Florida, and many other States. These trains easily compete with air travel and allow travelers a comfortable, fast and efficient means to reach their destination. 
High-speed rail will also aid Amtrak's bottom line. This new system will bring further profits to a business that badly needs the capital. 
Many critics will question the need for further public investment in Amtrak. As compared to other infrastructure programs, passenger rail gets little public support. Last year we spent $20 billion on highways, while capital investment for Amtrak was less than $450 million. In relative terms, between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, spending on highways increased 73 percent, aviation increased 170 percent, while spending on rail declined by 60 percent. 
Without proper reforms and additional capital funding the future of this railroad is at risk. I commend members of the Senate Commerce committee who have worked to deliver a solid reform proposal to the Senate. My hope is that the House will accept these changes and send this bill to the President before we adjourn for the year. The plan we have developed offers serious reforms that will enable the railroad to modernize while reducing operating costs. 
Our Nation needs passenger rail. Together, we must move forward to preserve this important transportation option. The investments we are committing to today will increase our Nation's investment in the Amtrak rail system, and allow it to succeed in its efforts to continue to operate into the future.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Vermont for raising what could be a very important issue to all of the people of this country who like milk. I don't understand how a court could do that, other than the fact that, when I read he was from Minnesota, I new why it was done. The judiciary sometimes gets a little prone to its own constituency. But I want to tell you, I want to raise the danger that this precedent sets. I urge Secretary Glickman to appeal the judge's decision and to make sure that this does not maintain an existence. 
If this ruling survives, it could be the final financial blow to many farmers throughout the country. It could also lead to higher prices consumers pay for their milk. Senator Leahy and I have stood on the floor many times defending Vermont's dairy farmers and dairy farmers across the country. We have fought to give both the dairy farmers and the consumers a fair and stable milk price. At times, debates on dairy policy have pitted one region against the other. In this case, a group of Midwestern milk producers hope to eliminate the pricing structure for fluid milk that dairy farmers and consumers rely upon for stable prices. 
This methodology of creating a system to provide differentials was created way back in our history, at a time when the original milk acts were considered, recognizing that it's incredibly important that we have fluid milk available to the families all across the Nation. One only has to remember back a few years ago when there was a tremendous drought in Minnesota and Wisconsin, in the area where these farmers say they can produce it for all the country. As a result of that, we had the huge price increases. We had to supply milk to other regions because they could not produce it sufficiently in Minnesota and Wisconsin. That is a demonstration as to why the original dairy legislation in the acts of the thirties made sure that this fluid milk would be available across the Nation at all times, understanding the need for fresh milk. 
If this ruling of the judge from Minnesota prevails, the entire country may ultimately rely on Minnesota and her bordering States for their milk supply. This would be extremely dangerous to consumers for prices and not being able to get it because of the lack of milk. 
I know that in Vermont, every morning--and I am sure it's the same at breakfast tables across the country--people enjoy fresh milk that was produced and packaged within a reasonable distance of their home and at reasonable prices. There are many other reasons for maintaining a healthy dairy industry in each region. The economic and social benefits ripple through each farming community. 
Mr. President, the present system for pricing fluid milk is currently under consideration from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. There is tremendous support for maintaining the current pricing structure for fluid milk. Recently, as Senator Leahy mentioned, 48 Senators and 113 House Members sent a letter to Secretary Glickman urging him to keep the current system. 
It is critical that the Secretary act quickly to request a stay and appeal this decision. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Leahy and myself in that request. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise again today to speak about the state of the District of Columbia public schools, an issue that is extremely important to me. And I am happy to say, that for the first time in the months that I've been bringing this issue to the attention of my colleagues, that there is some good news to report. 
Behind me there are two articles from yesterdays papers declaring the news that the advocacy group Parents United has settled its 5-year old lawsuit against the District over school repairs. I want to commend Parents United, Judge Kaye Christian, Gen. Julius Becton, and the many staff who were finally able to come to an agreement. The settlement outlines how repairs for these schools can take place as quickly as possible, with the least interruption of the school year as possible. 
On paper, that is a good first step. But in concrete terms, the only thing this deal has done is to stop unnecessary school closings, which are clearly having a detrimental effect on morale and achievement. What about the money and the orderly process for seeing that these repairs get accomplished? Look at Dr. Brimmer here and see what it boils down to: Congress. It boils down to us. 
Yes there is included in this settlement a commitment on the part of the control board to allocate money that the city borrows for school repairs, but let me remind my colleagues that unless the city has a sustainable dedicated revenue stream to be used for bonding credit, who knows how much the city will be able to borrow? In years past the city was considered essentially bankrupt, allowing for zero borrowing. How will the school system be able to execute repairs on schedule with an orderly process when they can't project a consistent budget? 
Let's look at the money that is needed to get the schools fixed. Based on a GSA report, and the D.C.P.S. 2010 long range facilities master plan--we need a total of $2 billion to get the D.C. schools repaired to code and modernized. The D.C.P.S. plan is a solid one, and it is broken into three phases: stabilization, functionality, and modernization. The total cost is estimated at $200 million a year over 10 years. Will Congress appropriate that kind of money? I think not--and history shows us so. 
Look at the money that D.C.P.S. had available--through congressional appropriation and city borrowing--for school infrastructure improvement over the last few years: In 1996--$14.9 million; in 1995--$21.1 million; in 1994--$9.5 million; and in 1993--$8.8 million. 
As you can see, Mr. President, this yearly allocation falls far short of $200 million. In fact, the average amount of money the District was able to spend on school repairs, over the last 10 years was $13.4 million. If we keep driveling money to the schools at that rate it will take the school system 150 years to meet their 10 year plan. How many children will have to suffer if we wait 150 years? 
There is a way for Congress to act responsibly. We must give the schools a dedicated revenue stream to bond with so that the $2 billion goal can be met. But at present Congress has its hands tied by its own actions. In 1974 when Congress created home rule we denied Washington the authority to be able to do what every other major city in an interestate area can do--and that is tax it non-resident workers. This is not some new fangled idea.It is what every other city in America can do to make sure its infrastructure and services are viable. I will speak about how Washington can accomplish this and a larger goal in a minute. 
But let's return to what happens when the schools don't have the money for repairs. The school year can't start on time. The upside of the severe disruption to the school year that has taken place is this September and October is that the focus of attention to the plight of our Nation's capital school system has never been greater. We have a lot of issues to deal with as national leaders, and bringing the focus to one school system is no easy task. But this is the school system of our Capital City--the school system that should be the flagship for education in our country, not the sinking vessel it has become. And as the leadership that created the control board, and created the emergency school board of trustees, and appropriates the city's funds each year we are responsible for turning this ship around. 
Now, let's look for a second at the academic ramifications of a school system in decay. Again, a piece of good news: the District of Columbia Public School system has a new chief academic officer, Arlene Ackerman, and I had the chance to meet with her last week and enjoyed that opportunity very much. Ms. Ackerman has done what any good manager would and prescribed an evaluation to see where the students in her charge are in terms of national standards. I have taken this information, which was released in the Washington Post last Thursday and let's see how that headline reads: 
`Tests Indicate Many Students in D.C. Won't be Promoted. . . .'. 
Now, I know this is appalling, but let me take you quickly through some of the actual test results in reading and math. These statistics are based on the Stanford 9 Achievement Test that was administered last Spring. 
As Arlene Ackerman said in her remarks when releasing these sorry statistics, `The lives of our children are at stake.' And let me state, for everyone listening, these children, the children of the Nation's Capital, are our children. Every Member of this body has a responsibility for their well being. And as you can see from these statistics, we are not living up to that responsibility. 
Is there a connection between Congress' annual appropriation process, the D.C.P.S. infrastructure emergency and these unfortunate academic test scores? You bet there is. As we saw earlier, every year that Congress appropriates far far less than the schools need for infrastructure is like giving a dying man a drop or two of water. Eventually the systems just wear out. In the process, you get low morale, low academic achievement and outraged parents and students. 
Look again at this article. That $487 million is only part of the $200 million a year I mentioned earlier. How are we going to get there? The city needs to have a dedicated revenue stream so that they can bond for infrastructure improvement. Where will that dedicated revenue stream come from? 
A nonresident income tax that benefits the tax-payer, the Washington Metropolitan Region and the District schools is the answer. With my proposal, the economy in our `Golden Crescent'--the area stretching from the District to Annapolis and as far west as Winchester, VA--gets an enormous boost. This bill creates an education and training partnership that would make it possible to fill the estimated 50,000 available jobs in the D.C. metropolitan area that rely on information technology skills. Filling these jobs would boost our regional economy by $3.5 billion annually. More jobs = a stronger tax base = more consumer spending = more home buying, and so forth. 
Leaders in the private sector know the direct correlation between those appalling test scores I just showed you and their bottom line. They know the cost in decreased productivity when jobs go begging for lack of skilled employees. They know how much it costs to start recruiting from all over the country and, some cases all over the world. 
The private sector I am speaking of resides in northern Virginia and southern Maryland. The payback to the counties in these States, if we fill these jobs and inject our local economy with that $3.5 billion a year will be manifold. Far greater than the outlay the nonresident income tax demands. And in the process we will be able, as a country, to feel pride in every aspect of our Nation's Capital. 
I know the pride I feel each time I fly back to Washington, especially at night, and see the beautiful monuments, all lit up. They symbolize this great country and the founding fathers who upheld the integrity and mission this country is built on. But I say to my colleagues, these monuments are made of stone. The living testament to the American system of government is it's children. Flesh and blood and the inheritors of all that our Founding Fathers dreamed of. If we as U.S. Senators cannot make the future a great one for the children of America's capital, then our pride in this city and its monuments is fraudulent. We must find a solution, and I challenge my colleagues to review my proposal or show me a better one. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cuban Women and Children Humanitarian Relief Act. The objective of this legislation, quite simply, is to remove some of the more objectionable aspects of the standing United States trade embargo on Cuba, especially those that imperil the health of women, children, and other vulnerable groups. The bill would remove existing restrictions on the sale to Cuba of American food, medicines, and health supplies. Under current law, it is all but impossible for American companies to sell these items to Cuba. 
Mr. President, I have long held reservations about the effectiveness of our trade embargo on Cuba. After all, we have maintained a trade blockade on Cuba for 37 years and have little to show for it in terms of moving the Cuban Government in the direction of freedom or peaceful coexistence. 
However, this bill is not about how best to pressure the Castro government. Nor is it intended in any way to signal a change in overall United States policy toward Cuba. What this bill is about is making sure that children and other vulnerable groups do not bear the brunt of the trade embargo. The impact of the embargo on these groups has become more severe since passage of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, which tightened the restrictions on food and medical shipments to Cuba. 
The respected American Association for World Health concluded that these new, tougher trade sanctions have caused `a significant rise in suffering--and even deaths--in Cuba.' In particular, the AAWH found that the embargo on food and medicines has led to malnutrition, reduced water quality, and the unavailability or short supply of routine medical supplies. 
I do not believe that the American people intended that the trade embargo against Cuba lead to such demonstrable human suffering. Whether one supports the overall embargo or not, surely we can agree that the pain that this policy inflicts should not be borne by children. 
All of which is not to absolve Fidel Castro of much of the blame for the deteriorating state of health in Cuba. The OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has noted that many of the medical products manufactured in Cuba are reserved for hospitals that cater to foreigners. This has apparently caused much resentment among ordinary Cubans who feel discriminated against in their country. 
But we, too, are the target of much resentment owing to our trade restrictions on medicines and medical supplies. If a Cuban cannot gain access to an important drug--50 percent of the most important drugs in the world are available only from the United States or United States-licensed firms--or no longer has safe drinking water because water treatment chemicals or water supply spare parts cannot be obtained, he can quite credibly blame the United States for his plight. In fact, Castro has made the most of this situation by pointing to the United States embargo as the source of almost all of Cuba's health problems. 
The State Department maintains that the United States trade restrictions have not blocked medical shipments to Cuba and that many firms have successfully met the conditions required to obtain a permit for such trade. However, the reality is that the requirements to obtain such a license are so stringent that few drug companies are willing even to consider sales to Cuba. Those that do often find themselves investigated for technical and inadvertent violations of the embargo and ultimately abandon efforts to sell to Cuba. Moreover, relief groups such as Catholic Relief Services and Church World Services have found the licensing requirements cumbersome, complex, and costly. 
Sales of foodstuffs are barred altogether. And there is no way around it--no licenses, special permits, or other recourse. I think it's worth noting that our current embargos against Iran, Iraq, and Libya do not bar the sale of food or medicines to those countries. 
Mr. President, the American people are not mean-spirited. We want our Government to be tough-minded in protecting our interests but do not want innocent people to suffer. Even in the case of those countries adamantly opposed to United States interests and values, such as Iran and North Korea, we have reached out with humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters and famines. We should treat Cuba no differently. We should not allow our political objectives undermine the health and well-being of those most in need, especially children.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Veterans' Disability Benefits Relief Act. This legislation would address an unfair provision that double taxes veterans who participate in military downsizing programs run by the Department of Defense [DOD]. 
Mr. President, since 1991, in an effort by the DOD to downsize the armed services, certain military personnel have been eligible for either the special separation benefit [SSB] or the voluntary separation incentive [VSI] program. However, SSB or VSI recipients who are subsequently diagnosed with a service-connected disability must offset the full SSB/VSI amount paid to that individual by withholding amounts that would be paid as disability compensation by the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]. 
Additionally, veterans who participate in the DOD's downsizing by selecting an SSB lump sum payment or a VSI monthly annuity payment, are forced to pay back the full, pretax amount in disability compensation--offsetting money that the veteran would never see with or without a service-connected disability. This is a gross injustice to veterans by double taxing their hard-earned compensation. 
My bill would ease this double taxation for all members who accept an SSB or VSI payment package and make these alterations retroactive to December 5, 1991. Thus, service members not able to receive payment concurrently since 1991 will be reimbursed for their lost compensation portion that was taxed. The cost of this bill was estimated by CBO to be only $195 million over 25 years. This is a fraction of a percentage of our annual spending on compensation and benefits for former military personnel. I urge Congress to correct this injustice to our Nation's veterans and provide these veterans with the proper compensation they deserve.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Daniel Urban Kiley of Charlotte, VT, recipient of a 1997 National Medal of Arts. The National Medal of Arts is our Nation's highest honor in the arts, recognizing individuals and organizations who have made outstanding contributions to the excellence, growth, support and availability of the arts in the United States. Mr. Kiley is the first landscape architect to be honored with this prestigious award. 
Mr. Kiley, 84, has been called `the most celebrated landscape architect of this century'. His many works include the setting for Dulles International Airport, the grounds for the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, the interior and exterior landscapes for the East Wing of the National Gallery of Art, and the Navy Pier in Chicago. Yet, despite his work all over the world, Mr. Kiley has stayed in close touch with the people and landscapes of Vermont. His work can be seen at Twin Farms Inn in Barnard, VT, the Lake Champlain Basin Region, and even at my own farm in Shrewsbury. 
Daniel Kiley's works have been likened to `a walk through nature,' reflecting his central tenet that designs should grow out of a landscape, not be forced upon it. His designs have been sought out by the leading modern architects and his unique vision celebrated and taught throughout the world. 
In addition to his long career as a landscape architect, Mr. Kiley served as an Army Captain in World War II. He was selected by President Truman and General Eisenhower to find a site to try the Nazi War criminals, and his selection of Nuremberg as the site as well as his courtroom design earned him the Decorated Legion of Merit. 
Once again, I rise to honor Mr. Kiley's many contributions and accomplishments, far too numerous to list today. As a Vermonter, and as one of the millions of Americans who have enjoyed Daniel Kiley's designs, I extend my most heartfelt congratulations on his receiving the National Medal of Arts, and I wish him many more years of continued success.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues an important matter, which I hope can receive consideration before we leave this fall. 
Last week, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources unanimously reported out a bill, S. 1294, the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997. This measure is a modest, but extremely important, effort designed to assist students attempting to finance their higher education. 
The measure enjoys broad bipartisan support. The House companion bill, H.R. 2335, was approved by a vote of 43 to 0 by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. This measure, with language identical to S. 1294, as reported by the Labor Committee, was subsequently approved by the full House under suspension by voice vote. It has also been endorsed by national associations representing students and institutions of higher education.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the House measure is now being held at the desk and is available for immediate action by the Senate. It has been cleared on the Republican side of the aisle. Unfortunately, due to objections from the other side of the aisle, we are unable to consider it. 
I want to take this opportunity to discuss the provisions of this legislation and the need to move expeditiously on it. This legislation does two things: 
First, it permits individuals to consolidate all their student loans--both Federal Direct Loan Program [FDLP] loans and Federal Family Education Loan Program [FFELP] loans--into a FFELP consolidation loan. Under current law, students who have both direct and guaranteed loans may only consolidate them into an FDLP consolidation loan administered by the Department of Education. 
The problem is that FDLP consolidation is not an option right now. Since August 26, the Department has suspended its consolidation program in an effort to deal with the backlog of 84,000 applications which had piled up prior to that time. 
Second, it assures that students and their parents will enjoy the full benefits of the educational tax credits contained within the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 by excluding these tax credits from consideration when student financial need is being assessed. 
Let me talk for a moment about why it is important to offer a loan consolidation option to those students who, right now, have nowhere to turn. The student loan consolidation program allows students to consolidate multiple student loans into a single loan that has several repayment options. The benefits of consolidation include the convenience of making a single monthly loan payment. In addition, the repayment options can reduce monthly payments. For many young families, these loans reduce their monthly payments enough to allow them to qualify for a mortgage for their first home. 
In my view, we need to make every possible effort to assure that consolidation is a benefit to students--not just another obstacle course. A New York Times article about the series of problems which has plagued the FDLP consolidation program operated by the Department of Education under contract with Electronic Data Systems Corp. brings to life the individuals whom this legislation is trying to help. 
Consider the following account regarding Shannan Elmore: 
It seemed like a simple enough thing to do: consolidate 10 different Government-sponsored college loans due over 10 years into one jumbo loan payable over 25, slashing the monthly payment to $350 from $448. That was one of the last things standing between Shannan Elmore and mortgage approval for the house--the one whose concrete foundation her husband had proposed in front of--that she wanted to build near Boulder, CO. But Mrs. Elmore, a 30-year-old chemist who graduated in May 1996 with a master's degree and $43,000 of debt, said it took eight months for the Electronic Data Systems Corporation to do the paperwork--far too long to satisfy the mortgage lender. During those months, Mrs. Elmore said, she called frequently only to be put on hold--for as long as 45 minutes--and received one promissory note missing the very page her lender needed to see. She said she was still trying to clear up a loan that E.D.S. thinks it paid off twice and for which it is double-billing her. The Elmores eventually qualified for a mortgage, but for a different house.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Department of Education officials have been working diligently to resolve the problems with the consolidation program and have indicated that it will reopen by December 1. I believe we would all welcome seeing the program back on its feet. In the meantime, we need to give students another option right now. 
We also need to help alleviate the pressure on the direct consolidation loan program which will inevitably occur when it reopens--only to face the pent-up demand built up over a 3-month period. Prior to the shutdown, applications were running approximately 12,000 per month. 
This legislation is intended to provide immediate relief to students and is designed specifically for that purpose. It modifies the current FFELP consolidation program to assure that loan subsidies are maintained, to provide for the same interest rate in effect for FDLP consolidation loans, and to protect borrowers against discrimination. 
The bill does not, nor is it intended to, address every issue which has been raised with respect to the loan consolidation provisions of the Higher Education Act. In anticipation that these issues would be fully debated and addressed in next year's reauthorization of the act, the consolidation provisions of this legislation will expire on October 1, 1998. 
Finally, this legislation also includes important provisions dealing with the calculation of student aid under the Higher Education Act. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 contained two educational tax credits designed to help students and their families pay for the rising cost of higher education. Under current law, the need analysis formula will consider students and their parents who receive the tax credit as having greater resources to pay for college, thereby reducing their eligibility for student financial aid. As a result, students and their families will find their financial aid reduced and that the amount they expended for higher education remained relatively unchanged by the educational tax credits. 
If the change in the need analysis formula included in this legislation is not made, approximately 69,000 individuals will lose an estimated $120 million in student financial aid. 
I do not believe that this needed relief for students should be further delayed, and I urge my colleagues to withdraw their objections so we can get this measure to the President. 
Mr. President, I want to just please urge those who are opposing the consideration of this bill to at least take the time to fully understand the ramifications of their failure to allow this bill to come up. I am sure that when they do so, they will recognize that this is not something which should be left undone before we leave here this fall.  
Exhibit 1 AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION, 
Office of the President, Washington, DC, October 28, 1997. 
Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the undersigned to express our strong support for S. 1294, the `Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997.' This urgent legislation contains two important provisions, each of which provides significant benefits for students. 
First, the bill amends the student aid need analysis section of Title IV to exclude from parental or student income the amount of any tax credit claimed under the `Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.' This is an essential conforming change that is necessary to fulfill the intent of framers of the tax bill regarding the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime tax credits. 
Second, the bill provides temporary, but much-needed, relief for tens of thousands of borrowers whose access to Direct Consolidation loans has been limited due to the problems experienced by the Department of Education in implementing the Consolidation program. While we hope the Department will soon eliminate the massive backlog of applications, and that it will be able to accept and process applications soon, it is important to provide additional consolidation options for borrowers who desperately need help now. S. 1294 will provide several significant borrower benefits: 
The bill allows borrowers to consolidate their student loans not only through the Direct Consolidation program, but also through the lender of their choice in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). 
It lowers the interest rate on FFEL Consolidation loans, and sets a maximum cap on interest at the same rate as is currently in effect for Direct Consolidation loans. 
It equalizes the treatment of certain interest exemption benefits for all borrowers by extending the Direct Consolidation program's treatment of these exemptions to the FFEL Consolidation program. 
The bill provides adequate non-discrimination provisions that go beyond current law in FFELP in limiting lender discretion. 
We respectfully request that you join us in supporting this important legislation, which provides a broad array of much-needed student benefits. 
Sincerely, 
Stanley O. Ikenberry, President.

Exhibit 2 
From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 1997  
Dropping the Ball in Juggling Loans; a Lot of Fumbles by E.D.S. in Processing Student Debt  
Dallas, Sept. 30: It seemed like a simple enough thing to do: consolidate 10 different Government-sponsored college loans due over 10 years into one jumbo loan payable over 25, slashing the monthly payment to $350 from $558. That was one of the last things standing between Shannan Elmore and mortgage approval for the house--the one whose concrete foundation her husband had proposed in front of--that she wanted to build near Boulder, Colo. 
But Mrs. Elmore, a 30-year-old chemist who graduated in May 1996 with a master's degree and $43,000 of debt, said it took eight months for the Electronic Data Systems Corporation to do the paperwork--far too long to satisfy the mortgage lender. 
During those months, Mrs. Elmore said, she called frequently only to be put on hold--for as long as 45 minutes--and received one promissory note missing the very page her lender needed to see. She said she was still trying to clear up a loan that E.D.S thinks it paid off twice and for which it is double-billing her. The Elmores eventually qualified for a mortgage, but for a different house. 
Mrs. Elmore is one of tens of thousands of recent graduates who have endured months of red tape as E.D.S. has struggled during the last year to fulfill its contract with the Education Department to run the Government's four-year-old effort to gain control of the nation's student loans. The delays have resulted in a Congressional hearing, prompted calls for legislation and given a black eye to both the Education Department and to E.D.S., the giant computer services company that is based in the Dallas suburb of Plano. 
At the hearing, held Sept. 18, Marshall Smith, Acting Deputy Secretary of the department, testified that it had taken E.D.S. almost five months, on average, to complete each loan consolidation, creating a backlog of 84,000 applications. To give E.D.S. time to catch up, the department ordered it to stop accepting new consolidation requests in August. 
This very public stumbling has put expansion of the Government's so-called direct student loan program in jeopardy. Republicans who opposed the Clinton Administration's 1993 effort to move student loans away from banks and into the hands of the Education Department are back in force. 
`What we said in '93 has come home to roost,' said Representative Howard P. McKeon of California, chairman of the subcommittee of the Committee on Education and the Work Force that held the recent hearing. Critics of the program said that it was doomed to create inefficiencies and bottlenecks. 
Under the direct-loan program, student loans are issued by the Government, instead of by banks or other private lenders. The program is supposed to simplify life for students, who often have to borrow from more than one bank and then keep track of loans that are sold to lenders in other parts of the country. 
The program is also supposed to trim Government administrative and interest expenses paid to lenders in the separate student loan operation in which repayment is simply guaranteed by Washington. And it provides students with more lenient repayment methods--allowing them to pay based on their income. The direct program has proved popular with students: it now represents about $20 billion in outstanding loans, about 16 percent of the total student debt, and is being used by 36 percent of all students borrowing for college expenses. E.D.S. issues the direct loans and oversees their consolidation. 
To help ease the consolidation logjam--and, not incidentally, slow the direct program's forward motion--critics of Government lending have scheduled a committee vote Wednesday on a measure that would allow students to consolidate loans through a bank even if one or more of the loans had been issued by the Government. That option is not currently available to them. If the measure is approved, it would go to the full House for consideration. 
Both E.D.S. and the Education Department say the logjam results from an unexpectedly large influx of consolidation applications and from a surprising amount of complexity in the process. E.D.S. said it had based its winning bid for the contract on department specifications that had forecast much less work. The department said it expected 7,000 to 8,000 applications each month; the actual rate was 12,000 a month. 
But analysts that follow E.D.S., along with an executive of the Maryland company that previously held the contract, suggest another explanation--that an E.D.S. eager to win business may have underbid the job in 1995 by underestimating how many workers would be needed. E.D.S. has had to add 77 customer service representatives to the 100 it originally assigned to the contract, and last year it replaced the managers running the project. 
Education Department officials acknowledge that they do not have the expertise to guide such a complicated computer effort. `A lot of the problems we run into with government is we don't block and tackle correctly,' Thomas Bloom, inspector general for the department, testified at the Sept. 18 hearing. The General Accounting Office, the Congressional watchdog, has repeatedly questioned the department's technical ability to handle financial aid information. 
George Newstrom, an E.D.S. corporate vice president for government contracts, said the company did not improperly underbid. `We don't do that,' he said E.D.S. would have had enough employees to do the work if the Government's estimates had been correct, he said. 
But E.D.S. has acknowledged that it miscalculated on other contracts that were bid around this time. In August, E.D.S. said that it had re-evaluated profits related to about a dozen contracts booked in 1994 and 1995, lowering the numbers. The changes cost the company $80 million in pretax income. 
Investor concerns over those errors combined with disappointing quarterly earnings to drive E.D.S.'s stock from a 52-week high of $63.375 last October to $35.50 today. The company is in the middle of a revamping that will shed 8,500 of its 100,000 jobs. 
E.D.S. dismissed at least one of the managers responsible for the troubled contracts, according to Myrna Vance, E.D.S.'s corporate vice president for investor relations. 
Mrs. Vance said the student loan account was not on the problem list in August. It is too early to tell whether the need to assign additional service representatives will mean lower profits there, she said. 
The company's February 1995 bid to the Education Department was submitted at a time when, analysts say, E.D.S. was in a period of flux and managers were especially eager to win contracts. 
E.D.S. was still adjusting to bruising competition from I.B.M., which had barged onto its turf in 1991 with aggressive bids for contracts that had long gone to the Texas company. Also, top E.D.S. management was distracted by the company's planned 1996 spinoff from the General Motors Corporation, which had bought the company from its founder, Ross Perot, in 1984. The spinoff would remove E.D.S. from G.M.'s protective wing, leaving it to stand or fall on its own. 
E.D.S., long the industry leader in handling computer services for big clients, finished 1995 with $12.4 billion in revenue, up from $10 billion the year before. But according to a Merrill Lynch analyst, Stephen T. McClellan, the company was finding it increasingly difficult to keep up the double-digit earnings growth it had come to regard as its due. Worse, I.B.M. was gaining on E.D.S. for total contracts won and would roar past in 1996. 
It was in this atmosphere that E.D.S. prepared its $162 million bid to issue and consolidate direct loans over a five-year period. The bid was at least 50 percent lower than the one submitted by the Maryland company that had been doing the job, the CDSI/Business Applications Solutions unit of Computer Data Systems Inc. E.D.S. soon won a second five-year contract, worth $378 million, to service the loans. 
Thomas A. Green, president of the CDSI unit, said that his company had already started to see a surge in interest in the direct-loan program--and the Education Department should have know that. `We were sending out applications all the time, so it was clear that the popularity of the program was growing,' Mr. Green said. `They weren't blind-sided at what it was going to be when they took over,' he said of E.D.S. 
Mr. Green also said his company was never as backlogged as E.D.S. has been. He said CDSI consolidated 144,000 loans in the 22 months between January 1995 and November 1996, when it finished its work. The average consolidation took 65 to 70 days, he added. 
That compares with an average of 142 for E.D.S., according to Mr. Smith, the Education Department official. E.D.S. has processed about 54,000 loans since taking over last September, he told the House panel. 
One of those affected by the delays is Robyn Higbee, who says she went back and forth on the phone for six months to consolidate two of her husband's law school loans totaling $18,500. Mrs. Higbee struggled with this as the family moved from Virginia to California, her husband studied for the bar exam and started a new job, the couple bought their first home and she gave birth to a baby who required heart surgery. 
`It was just something that was totally unnecessary,' Mrs. Hibgee, 25, said of the loan complications. 
Randolph Dove, a spokesman for the company in its Washington-area office, while not familiar with the details of Mrs. Higbee's and Mrs. Elmore's cases, said that E.D.S. regretted the difficulties any students have had. `We've been working very hard and have a lot of people dedicated to resolving this,' he said. 
Over all, E.D.S. has recovered from its dry spell in winning contracts. I.B.M. won $27 billion in new business last year, compared with E.D.S.'s $8.4 billion, according to Greg Gould, a computer services analyst at Goldman, Sachs, but this year E.D.S. has already won or is close to signing $16.4 billion worth of contracts. Also, gross margins are up for the work E.D.S. managers are bringing in--25 percent rather than the 16 percent on contracts in 1994 and 1995, Mr. Gould said. And top management has increased its control of underlings who may have been tempted to bid too low to win a contract, he added. `There's that winner's curse,' he said. `You want to win and you just lower your price until you win the contract.' 
The prognosis for direct student loans is murkier. E.D.S. expects to have the kinks out of its system and its backlog erased by Dec. 1, Mr. Dove said. Students can then start applying once more for consolidations, he said. 
But the concern over the logjam is undercutting the Government's plans to expand the program. Representative McKeon, who introduced the legislation now before the education committee, concedes that there are not enough opponents of direct loans to kill the program outright. But his bill would at least end the Government's monopoly over consolidation that restricts all students who have any direct loans. 
For E.D.S.'s part, Mrs. Vance said that the publicity would not have much impact on the company's prospects. `One contract is not going to set a trend or be a deterrent for new business,' she said. 
The Education Department, however, is considering whether to cancel the $378 million contract with E.D.S. for servicing the loans. Such a move could come because applications for new loans are, oddly enough, now running below expectations. A cancellation would not be related to the problems with the consolidations, a department spokesman said, adding that another company's servicing contract is also in jeopardy. 
But even some of the lawmakers who mostly blame the Education Department for the program's troubles are asking whether E.D.S. should be punished by being docked part of its pay. Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan, said he might favor doing that. 
Even without that penalty, however, E.D.S. will feel some pain, Mr. Hoekstra said, adding, `I wouldn't want to be identified as the vendor that forced the Federal Government to shut down consolidations in the direct-loan program with a backlog of 84,000 kids.'

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for the past few days, the Senate has been considering the conference report to accompany the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. While there are several areas of controversy, I would like to highlight one area that I believe has not been given sufficient consideration: funding for the National Guard. 
This bill contains a couple of disturbing provisions, not so much for their immediate impact, but for their long-term consequences. First, the proposal to add a representative for the Guard and Reserves on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which I strongly support, has been watered down to call for two two-star advisors to the Chairman of the JCS. Mr. President, this is essentially the same role that the head of the National Guard Bureau has today. I do not see this as an enhancement of the Guard's status in the highest circles of decisionmaking. And I'm told that in the Pentagon, two two-stars don't equal a four. I am afraid that the current pattern of decisionmaking is responsible for the shortfall in resources for the National Guard that we see in the legislation before us, and if it is not altered in a significant manner, the National Guard is likely to have greater problems in the future. 
The other provision that I would like to draw my colleagues attention to is the cut in Army National Guard personnel endstrength of 5,000. Mr. President, we all understand that over the next few years, endstrengths will come down for all the services. But what this bill does is to pick out one component of the military and require it to make a significant cut without calling on other components to begin their agreed-upon reductions. In fact, this bill forces reductions in the only part of the U.S. Army to actually meet its endstrength requirements. I am not sure that all my colleagues realize that because the Army National Guard is actually over its required endstrength by about 2,000 people, the legislation will force the layoff of more than 5,000 young men and women who are currently serving their country. Whereas if similar cuts were to come in the active component, the cuts would be implemented in large part by eliminating unfilled positions. This does not seem to me to be the way to maintain a dedicated cadre of military professionals. 
Finally, I speak out today because I am concerned that this legislation may be taken as a sign by some as a change in Congress' attitude toward the National Guard. I very strongly believe that the future of the U.S. Armed Forces must include a greater role for the Guard and Reserves, not a diminished one. As defense resources shrink, as the nature of our employment structures change, and as we develop better tools for keeping our weekend warriors up to speed as top quality practioners of their military arts, we must put more of our faith in that part of the U.S. military that is closest to the people--the National Guard. 
For too long, Congress has been seen as the primary bastion of support for the Guard and Reserves--not the Pentagon. An example of this is the administration's request for no new procurement funds for fiscal year 1998 for the Army Guard and Air Guard, out of a total procurement budget request of $42,883,000,000. This is not only unrealistic--it is dangerous. And until the administration sends up a more balanced request, Congress will have to continue its vigilance on behalf of the Guard. But this is not the way it should be, Mr. President, and I am disappointed that the bill before us today did not take advantage of the opportunity to change this situation. 
It is my impression that a great debate continues to rage on the future structure of our military forces. I trust that this bill will not be taken as Congress' comments on that discussion, and that renewed energy will go into finding a better solution to these dilemmas in the coming years.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to `Jeopardy' and its efforts in educational outreach. The show has been successful in providing more than just entertainment for its audience. In over 3,000 episodes spanning 14 years, `Jeopardy' has challenged viewers to expand their horizons and learn more about some fundamental fields of study. 
`Jeopardy' seeks and demands attentive participation. Accordingly, this forum has often been used by schools throughout the country to improve students' performance in a wide array of subjects. 
The show will be taping in 2 weeks worth of episodes from Washington, DC, at Constitution Hall. The first week will pay tribute to the educational accomplishments of our Nation's best and brightest children. The second week will spotlight members of the political community to raise more than $150,000 for worthy causes and stress the value of education. 
It seems clear that `Jeopardy' realizes the significance of learning for people both young and old. I salute `Jeopardy' for reaching beyond the television screen to provide quality programming with truly profound educational benefits for every community across the Nation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to continue a discussion that my colleague, Senator Leahy, began earlier, with regard to the Federal Communications Commission proposed rulemaking on regulations for wireless and digital broadcast facilities. 
University of Vermont instructor and landscape designer Jean Veissering recently stated `We have a real spiritual connection with hilltops. They tend to be almost sacred ground. Building something jarringly out of character upon them seems almost like a sacrilege.' Mr. President, I share Jean's sentiments completely. In addition, it is the beautiful views of the majestic mountain ranges that in many ways defines what Vermont is all about. 
Vermonters take great pride in their heritage as a State committed to the ideals of freedom and unity. That heritage goes hand and hand with a unique quality of life and the desire to grow and develop while maintaining Vermont's beauty and character. Ethan Allan and his Green Mountain Boys and countless other independent minded Vermonters helped shape the Nation's 14th State while making outstanding contributions to the independence of this country. Today, that independence still persists in the hills and valleys of Vermont. Vermonters have worked hard over the years to maintain local control over issues that impact them directly. 
Throughout my years in Congress, I fought hard to protect the ability of Vermonters to step out of their kitchen doors and see an unobstructed view. Thousands of Americans travel to Vermont each year to take in the splendid nature of the State. 
However, Vermont could have looked quite different if it were not for some foresight on behalf of several Vermonters. In the 1960's, the State of Vermont was entering into a period of unchecked development. In response, Governor Dean C. Davis created the Commission on Environmental Control in May of 1969. The commission drafted a set of recommendations to help manage the precious resources of the State. 
As the attorney general for the State at that time, I was one of the primary drafters of an environmental land use law which would later become known as Act 250. Act 250 was specifically written to control development, not to stop development, and in turn, this act has led Vermont to economic prosperity through balanced environmental protection. 
After reviewing the Commission on Environmental Control's recommendation and the proposed legislation, Governor Davis made one very basic, but important change in the legislation. The proposed legislation had called for a State agency to administer the act. The Governor was adamant in his belief that the control should be as close to the people as possible. It is that control which the FCC's proposed rulemaking is looking to preempt. 
Governor Davis' recommendation led to placing the permitting process in the hands of local environmental review boards with appeal rights to the Vermont Environmental Board. Thus, the act is administered by men and women who are directly involved in their communities and thoroughly familiar with local concerns. 
When reviewing an application for new development, the local environmental review boards take into account the economic needs of the State along with regional concerns. The review board's underlying goal is to direct the impact of development toward the positive. The positive approach has led to a high priority on preserving the environment, protecting the natural resources, and maintaining the quality of life of all Vermonters. 
On October 9, 1997, the State of Vermont Environmental Board filed comments with the Federal Communications Commission that stated: `Far from being an impediment to personal wireless service deployment, Vermont's Act 250 demonstrates that the path to economic prosperity is through balanced environmental protection, not preemption of such protection.' I share the board's sentiments and feel that the FCC should take no further steps to preempt Vermont's Act 250 with respect to personal wireless service facilities. 
Mr. President, the Green Mountain State has unique topography, dominated by rolling valleys and tall mountains. In turn, the citizens of the State have taken many steps to help preserve the beautiful views and pristine environment. The determination of the location of visible transmission towers should remain within the jurisdiction of local control. I feel that the Telecommunication Act of 1996 recognizes and protects the interest of local and State government in the area of land use regulation. 
As the attorney general of the State of Vermont at the time of the enactment of Act 250, I am proud of the role I and many other Vermonters played in the subsequent management of the precious natural resources of the State. I support Act 250 and feel that the placement of communications towers should be left in the hands of the residents of Vermont not by a Federal agency. 
I have written to the Chairman of the FCC with regard to my concerns about this proposed rulemaking. In addition, yesterday the Senate confirmed William Kennard to be the next Chairman of the FCC. Upon his confirmation, I wrote a letter to Chairman Kennard personally inviting him to the State of Vermont to see first hand how this proposed rulemaking would impact the State. I hope that he will join me on a tour of the State which will demonstrate to him the importance of local control with respect to the placement of broadcast facilities. Further, I look forward to explaining how Act 250 has allowed for the development of wireless communication in the State while protecting the environment. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, I want to commend Mr. Leahy for introducing this very important legislation for the State of Vermont. I am pleased to be a cosponsor and I look forward to working with him to protect Vermont's interests unique landscape.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of the Senate the tragic situation we have going on right now in the school system of the Nation's Capital. 
Nearly every day for the past month an article has appeared in the Washington papers portraying the State of emergency and dysfunction in the District of Columbia's public school system--the shutting down of schools. 
Here are some of the facts: 
For the fourth year in a row the schools in this city have opened late by at least 2 weeks. This year they are continuing to be closed by the fact that there are repairs that are essential and necessary to be made. 
The reason they have opened late is because of an infrastructure emergency--repairs and renovations. These needs are estimated by the GSA to be about $2 billion. And this is almost all for code violations. It has nothing to do with their acceptability from educational function purposes. 
The Congress of the United States is responsible for the schools of the Nation's Capital, the students who depend on these schools, and the repairs these schools need. 
What are we doing about this? 
I, for one, am ashamed of the way we have not done anything that is responsible to this point, other than what the Appropriations Committee has done out of necessity but not the way that it ought to be done to be responsible. 
I ask my colleagues to take a look at the human result of schools opening late and then closing again. 
I ask you to take a look at this. This came from the Washington Post. I will read it to you. The sign says, `Why should students suffer? For adult incompetence.' 
Those adults are us. We are the ones that have the primary responsibility for the city. We took it back. We took home rule away basically. 
This student is from a senior high school and holds a sign. These students were all forced out of their school and forced to be trucked, bused, whatever else, to some other place to be able to receive education until such time as that school is fixed. All this student wants to do is to go to class and start paving the way for her future. Who are the adults that this poster refers to? They are us. We cannot deny that. I hope we begin to understand that. 
Times have changed. We took back home rule basically. 
Why is the city in this mess? Why can't they get the revenue stream they need to bond so that they can responsibly repair these schools on some sort of a schedule, to get them all done so they can be done when the school year opens, and to do it not in a piecemeal fashion as the Appropriations Committee has been forced to do by having emergencies to appropriate money to do this? 
We have to have a plan. If somebody else has a plan to do it, fine. But we cannot let this situation go on where year after year we are going to be doing this, shutting the schools down and trying to find ways to open them. We created this problem. This is another important thing to remember. 
In 1974, when we gave home rule to Washington, DC, a very, very astute Member of the Virginia delegation--I commend him for his foresight because Lord knows what would have happened if they had all this additional money to spend with what they did have--but he got legislation passed which said that you can't tax the nonresidents that are working in your city. This is the only city in the country under this situation that does not have that authority. 
Sure, the District could levy an income tax on its own residents, but due to the inability to tax the nonresidents, and especially because of the situation in the city--the workers were fleeing out of town; crime was the No. 1 issue; schools second--people were leaving in droves. A lousy educational system, a lousy police system, and so we went from about 50 percent of the workers being residents down to about 30 percent. 
As money drained from the District, crime went up, as I said, and the school system deteriorated causing the well-known national phenomenon known as `urban flight.' 
But the urban and middle class population stayed close to the District of Columbia in the suburbs because it is the crown jewel of this metropolitan region. Being the Nation's Capital, the District provides the jobs, the tourism, the prestige and therefore high-earning capacity to an enormously affluent population residing in the surrounding Virginia and Maryland counties. 
But like a tiger with no teeth, the District, under current law, has no ability to levy any fair recompense from those who benefit daily from its services, its roads, and all else, and, namely, their jobs. 
Let me point out, every other city in an interstate circumstance like D.C. does have the ability to gain revenues from nonresident workers to support the maintenance of their schools, and whatever else. 
In the absence of such a dedicated revenue stream, Congress has tried to keep the city afloat through the annual appropriations process. But in some ways that is like giving a man dying of thirst a drop or two of water every year. Eventually, the biological systems just give out from the stress of such bare-bones maintenance. And that is what has happened to the school system here. It is in the process of giving out. 
Listen to the beginning of the article from yesterday's Washington Post.  
District schoolchildren lined up somberly in the cold mist early yesterday outside Emery Elementary School in Northeast Washington, waiting to be taken to makeshift classes at a nearby school and a neighboring church. Their school was one of five closed late last week. . . 
This is dated October 28th, so this is well after school should have begun. where asbestos is being removed during boiler repairs. 
That is what has been going on. We just cannot blind ourselves to it. And I know when you talk about D.C., most everybody and Members just say, `Well, that's not our problem.' But it is. That is the message I want to give them today. 
In 1995, Congress created the Control Board and later the Emergency School Board of Trustees thereby taking back most of the authority over the management and delivery of education which the Senate previously had. And we therefore took over the responsibility of the schools of this city. This Emergency School Board of Trustees deals specifically with the school infrastructure problem. 
Earlier, the Control Board asked GSA to estimate the need, and outline a plan for repair and renovation. And the report came out in September of 1995, showing a $2 billion sum, mostly for code violations, in order to make the schools physically safe for the children to be in. 
The thought of appropriating $2 billion from the Congress, to do this in an orderly fashion, is of course impossible to think of. And why should they when all they have to have is the power that any other city, under the circumstances, has to take really a 1 percent tax on the nonresidents in order to be able to raise enough money on the bonding to fix the schools? 
Why shouldn't the people that benefit from the jobs in this city take part in helping the city, like those benefiting in every other city under these similar circumstances do? 
We have on our shoulders the burden of these schools. The average District of Columbia public school facility is 65 years old. 
We have also taken on our shoulders the fact that 48 more roofs need to be replaced. That is in addition to all of those that have been replaced up to now. We have taken on ourselves the burden that 72 of the school boilers need to be replaced. We are heading into winter right now and already they are blowing up or failing. So we will see these boilers starting to blow up more on the days ahead. The colder it gets the more they will be going, and we will get more articles in the Washington Post and more condemnation for our failure to act. 
The control board has tried to meet the demands. Under the direction of Gen. Julius Becton, 61 school roofs have been repaired or replaced since January 1997 but that is all from emergency money from the Appropriations Committee--not a sound way to do it. Over the past 2 years, $86 million has been appropriated for such repairs. Also, I have been able to raise a similar amount by being able to find things that were going to raise money within the city like the privatization of Sallie Mae and Connie Lee, so we have put a lot of money into fixing these schools up, but to do it piecemeal one or two schools at a time--it will be 40 years before we are done at that rate. The District needs a dedicated revenue stream to be able to bond to meet the $2 billion challenge. We need that stream to responsibly meet our responsibilities. 
I have a plan to do that. If someone else has a better plan, fine, bring it forward, let's take a look at it, but let us not fail to meet our responsibilities. 
My proposal to meet this challenge is laid out in the legislation S. 1070, which proposes a nonresident income tax to provide that dedicated revenue stream to fix the schools, to provide that $2 billion. Incidentally, I want to reassure, and I don't know how many of my colleagues listen to us when we are here, but I know a number of our staff do because they called up in a panic thinking they would have to pay more taxes. I want to reassure them that that is not the case because already in the law they are required to allow people to take that as a tax credit for either the Virginia or Maryland taxes they pay, so no one is going to pay any more taxes. That will all be able to be taken as a credit against the taxes of Maryland and Virginia. 
For all of those hard-working residents of northern Virginia and southern Maryland I say you will not have a difference in your tax. I want to emphasize that. 
My proposal is also to take a reasonable approach to the issue of education and training, to create a reasonable partnership dedicated to fix the 50,000 jobs that are out in this area that are going begging because the region does not provide the necessary skills for them to take these jobs. 
If we go up to 3 percent we can provide a revenue stream for the District to help them float municipal bonds or to provide money to improve their educational system. I know the Presiding Officer from North Carolina had spectacular results in taking care of regions, and providing the educational skill and training in regions, and I know this will work here if we have the funding to do it. 
The bill represents a novel and equitable approach. The taxpayer suffers no economic detriment. The taxpayer's community in the Washington metropolitan area will receive substantial additional education training benefit. Workers for the thousands of available jobs will be provided new business which will be attractive and substantial new tax revenues will be raised. This is a win-win win-win. 
In this process, Congress will live up to its responsibility to meet that $2 billion challenge through the simple act of giving the District of Columbia the ability to act like any other city in a similar interstate situation. By giving up our responsibility we will not have to bear the shame of knowing that those adults the marching students referred to, `Why should students suffer--for adult incompetence,' that we would no longer be placed in a position of having to respond to that. 
I thank my colleagues. I urge them in joining me to make the issue of our Nation's Capital school system a top priority for us.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution to designate the fourth Friday in April, April 24, 1998, as National Child Care Professional's Day. 
For the more than 12 million children under the age of five--including half of all infants under 1 year of age--who spend at least part of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents--it is important that we recognize the skills and dedication of the child care providers who take care of them. Child care professionals take care of our Nation's children in homes and centers throughout the country. They assume this responsibility for little pay, long hours, and few, if any benefits beyond the hugs and smiles of the children for which they care. 
As the public dialog on child care moves to the forefront, we must keep in mind the people who are caring for our children, while their mothers and fathers work. If we want to move child care from babysitting to early childhood education we have to concentrate much of our efforts on professional development for child care providers. And we have to support efforts to make child care a valued profession--one that attracts the best and brightest and pays enough to keep them caring for our children. 
Since 1990, the costs of child care have risen about 6 percent annually. This is almost triple the annual increase in the cost of living. At the same time, there are strong indicators that the quality of child care has significantly decreased during the same period of time. Parents are paying more bet getting less. 
The quality of child care in America is very troubling. A recent nationwide study found that 40-percent of the child care provided to infants in child care centers was potentially injurious. Fifteen percent of center-based child care providers for all pre-schoolers are so bad that a child's health and safety are threatened; 70-percent are mediocre--not hurting or helping children; and 15-percent actively promote a child's development. Center-based child care, the object of this study, is the most heavily regulated and frequently monitored type of child care. There are strong indications that care for children in less regulated settings, such as family-based child care and in-home care, is far worse. 
Unless we are willing to provide the support and assistance that is needed to help child care providers improve the services they provide to our children, there is little real hope for enhancing the quality of child care. 
Since the 1970's there has been a decline in child care teacher salaries. In 1990, teachers in child care centers earned an average of $11,500 a year. Assistant teachers, the largest growing segment of child care professionals, were paid 10- to 20-percent less than child care teachers. The 1990 annual income of regulated family child care providers was $10,944 which translates to about $4 an hour. Nonregulated family child care, generally comprised of providers taking care of a smaller number of children, earned an average of $4,275 a year--substantially less than minimum wage. 
With these wages, it is easy to understand why more child care providers do not participate in professional training or attend college classes to improve their skills. The costs of applying for and receiving certification as a qualified child care professional are minimal, but understandably out of reach for many child care providers. 
Think about it. At the most important time in the development of a child's brain, more than 12 million children are being cared for by people who are paid less than the person who picks up your garbage each week, are required to have less training than the person who cuts your hair, and less skill-based testing than the person delivering packages to your house. Child care providers play an important role in a child's development, for they help fine-tune the child's capacity to think and process information, social skills, emotional health, and acquisition of language. 
That is why this resolution is so important. Good child care enables parents to work and maintain economic self-sufficiency--the goal of last year's welfare reform legislation. This resolution is a small step to increase the public's awareness of the need to support and recognize the vital work provided by child care professionals. 
On April 24, 1998, I hope each of us will visit a child care center or family-based child care provider in our State. Lead efforts to celebrate the contributions that child care professionals make to our society, our economy, our families, and most of all--our children.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for a very eloquent statement on where we are and where we ought to be. 
I think it is incredibly important that those of us who are as dedicated as she is and as I am--perhaps those of us in the middle, as so often happens in this body--have to take a look at what we can do to pull things together. 
Now, I am personally convinced, having talked with a number of Democratic Senators and a number of Republican Senators, that there are at least 60 Senators who want meaningful campaign reform. However, we have postured ourselves at this time and particular moment in a situation where that will not occur. I am pleased in a way that we are going into a brief period of recess. I am dedicated, as I know the Senator from Maine is, to using that period of time to try to find, if we can, a common ground. 
I think it is important for us to take a look at what we really need to do and where the real stumbling blocks are. We are two political parties, Republicans and Democrats. Some things advantage one and some things advantage another. So we have to find ways to reform the campaign finance system and do whatever is necessary to make sure that we can find something that both sides can--not willingly, but certainly with the public pressure out there now--do something. We can find a way to do that. 
What needs to be done? The Senator from Maine has done superb work in trying to find a middle ground on one issue with the Democratic Party, and that is how to handle the situation with unions--and we would say all groups--to make sure that the people that are involved, that have to contribute the money, or do contribute the money, have a say in how that money is spent; first, so that they know how it has been spent in the past so they can better judge what happens in the future, but also that they have full disclosure and the ability to say no, or the ability to at least say `not my money,' which is what our amendment does. I think that is a very big step forward. 
Now, there have been all sorts of technical problems raised with this, that, and the other thing. But the substance of it is one in which all America can agree. When you are in the situation where you have money taken from you, you ought to have at least a say as to where it is going and, even more important, to say `not my money.' `You can spend your money and the rest of the money, but not mine.' I think that is a pretty simple philosophy with which many Americans would agree. 
The next area we have to take a look at--and this is critical for the Republicans and it is also the center of debate nationwide--is what happened at the White House with all this money pouring in, hundreds of thousands over here, and all that so-called soft money. We have to do something about that. But to say that, especially under the Constitution, we can just ban it, or we can set up rules where you can't use any of it, that is not going to work. It is not going to work because people have the right under our first amendment to be able to spend money on political campaigns, but how much and for what purposes, that can be controlled, as we have found. 
I will tell you, the money will find a way, some way, to be spent. If we don't have it spent for `party building' as `soft money,' it will be in `issue advocacy' or `independent expenditures.' So the best thing to do is to make sure that there are limits placed on it, that there is full disclosure, and that there are ways to make sure that these funds are not abused or become dominant in the process. There are ways to do that. They are not ones that everybody is going to readily agree upon. But on the other hand, from a first amendment perspective, the way people want to help a political party ought to be something that we can find a solution for. So I hope now that we are in this situation where it is obvious that no final decision can be made, no way will be found in the next few hours for us to solve this, that we step back and work together. The Senator from Maine and I are both dedicated to finding those Senators in the middle that are willing to help us pull something together so that we can get at least 60 votes. 
I hope now that we can move back to the regular legislative process in the interim, to move legislation along which is necessary to be moved along, and, hopefully, as the Senator suggested, the leaders will get together and we can find a way to pull that middle together. There may be kicking and screaming in order to do that, but possibly we can find a way to let this Nation know that we want campaign finance reform, we want the process to be one we can be proud of, one which is acceptable to the American people, and one which allows everybody to know what is going on. I thank the Senator for her statement. I am sorry that we are in this situation, but I think it is important that we take a breath of fresh air and come back in the next week or so and, hopefully, make some progress. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise today to introduce a bill to assist in the preservation of Asian elephants. The bill, the `Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997', is modeled after the highly successful African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988 and the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994. It will authorize up to $5 million per year to be appropriated to the Department of the Interior to fund various projects to aid in the preservation of the Asian elephant. 
Since the challenges of the Asian elephants are so great, resources to date have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of habitat and the consequent diminution of Asian elephant populations 
Among the threats to the Asian elephant in addition to habitat loss are population fragmentation, human-elephant conflict, poaching for ivory, meat, hide, bones and teeth, and capture for domestication. To reduce, remove, or otherwise effectively address these threats to the long-term viability of populations of Asian elephants in the wild will require the joint commitment and effort of nations within the range of Asian elephants, the United States and other countries, and the private sector. 
On April 22, 1997, I introduced the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act of 1997 (S. 627). By the late 1980's, the population of African elephants had dramatically declined from approximately 1.3 million animals in 1979 to less than 700,000 in 1987. The primary reason for this decline was the poaching and illegal slaughter of elephants for their tusks, which fueled the international trade policy. Today, as a result of the bill, the African elephant population has stabilized, international ivory prices remain low, and wildlife rangers are better equipped to stop illegal poaching activities. 
I am a strong proponent of the protection and conservation of endangered species. If we do not act now, the world's future generations may not be able to enjoy many of the species of wildlife now in existence. This small, but critical investment of U.S. taxpayer money will be matched by private funds and will significantly improve the likelihood that wild Asian elephants will exist in the 21st Century. It is my hope that the Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997 will hopefully see the same successes that the African elephant bill has seen.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997. This bill will provide emergency relief to the nearly 70,000 students nationwide whose efforts to consolidate their student loans have been thwarted by the collapse of the Department of Education's Direct Loan Consolidation Program. In addition this bill makes conforming changes in the Higher Education Act to ensure that students who receive the Hope Tax Credit are able to receive all of the financial aid to which they are entitled. The Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act of 1997 is the companion bill to H.R. 2535 which was favorably reported by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce on September 24, 1997, by a bipartisan vote of 43-0. 
The rapidly rising cost of attending college is producing students with overwhelming student loan debt loads. The College Board reports that tuition at 4-year private institutions has risen by 89 percent over the past 15 years while median family income has risen by only 5 percent. Students are responding by borrowing at record levels--in fact, student borrowing under Title IV since 1990 exceeds student borrowing in the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's combined. Between 1993 and 1995, graduate and professional student borrowing increased by over 74 percent. 
In order to ease the burden of repaying these debts, Congress created the student loan consolidation program. This program allows students to consolidate their student loans into a single loan that has a variety of repayment options. Current law allows students to consolidate all of their Direct Student Loans and their Federal Family Education Loan Program [FFELP] loans into a Direct Lending Consolidation loan administered by the Department of Education. A student may consolidate his or her FFELP loans into a FFELP Consolidation Loan but may not consolidate his or her Direct Loans into the FFELP Program. As a result, borrowers who wish to consolidate both Direct Student Loans and FFELP loans into a single loan must go to the Department of Education. 
Last August, the Department of Education announced that it had accumulated a backlog of 85,000 applications for consolidated loans and would cease accepting new applications until this backlog was eliminated. This decision places more than 70,000 students in limbo with no place to turn for help. This bill will provide temporary authority to allow them to consolidate all of their loans, both FFELP and Direct through the FFELP program. 
In addition, this legislation makes technical corrections to the need analysis provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to conform with changes made to the Tax Code earlier this year which provide students and parents with higher education tax credits. The bill addresses an oversight in the tax legislation which will result in some students receiving reduced student aid under Title IV of the Higher Education Act simply because they qualify for and receive the new tax credits. By adopting this change to the need analysis formula now, the Department can begin the process of revising the student aid application forms well in advance of the 1999 academic year.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Vermont Educational Television, or Vermont ETV as it is known, on the occasion of its 30th anniversary. The station, which is a member of the Public Broadcasting Service, will begin to celebrate its long track record of success in October. A series of brief clips will be shown throughout the year to take a look back at some of the more memorable moments in its programming. 
Vermont ETV understands that learning is a lifelong process. Through community support, this station is able to provide exceptional programming 24 hours a day with something for every age group. Some of my favorite shows are produced locally by Vermont ETV, presenting a unique perspective for issues and events important to people in the region. The station's impeccable selection of shows provides both an entertainment and educational value for all Vermonters. 
Of noteworthy importance is their efforts to address the needs of pre-school children through the Ready To Learn and Early Education Initiative. In close cooperation with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as well as the Department of Education, these programs are designed to assist children and prepare them for the challenges they will face in school. Vermont ETV is dedicated to providing children, from a wide array of backgrounds, with the opportunity to start off on equal ground. 
Vermont ETV is one of the finest examples of a successful community partnership, with almost 78% of its budget financed through donations from the public. I believe that Vermont ETV sets the standard similar stations in other States should strive to emulate. That is why I have been an active supporter for over 20 years. I would like to extend my congratulations and best wishes to Vermont ETV, its employees as well as its supporters, for many more years of continued success.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to remark on the passing of a valued friend of the U.S. Senate, Michael Gutowski, a specialist in private health insurance issues at the General Accounting Office. Michael died suddenly and unexpectedly on September 23 at the age of 53. He was stricken during a meeting with Labor Department officials while gathering information for a report on the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that I requested. 
Over the past 10 years, Michael directed a remarkable series of studies, almost 50 in all. Many focused on gaps in private health insurance coverage, gaps that make affordable coverage under reasonable terms unavailable to many groups and individuals. Michael's reports were remarkable in a number of ways. First, they succeeded in keeping the Congress up-to-date on the evolution of the private health insurance market. Second, the reports, while based on thorough and often innovative data collection techniques, were not just a tabulation of statistics. Michael had a remarkable gift for weaving data into a clear and articulate story, one that was immediately comprehensible and compelling. 
During my tenure as chairman, the reports, testimony, and briefings Michael developed for the Labor and Human Resources Committee have consistently informed our deliberations on health care policy. We have benefited from the research he led regarding employer strategies in purchasing health insurance, children's health insurance, the role of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and State insurance regulation, and the implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. In all these areas, he drew on his wide knowledge of the real world insurance marketplace. I know that his contribution to other congressional committees and Members on a diverse range of housing, health policy, economic, and workers compensation issues both at GAO and the Congressional Budget Office have been equally valued. In 1995, Michael received the Assistant Comptroller General's award for studies related to health care reform. 
Michael was an economist by training but a humanitarian by heart, warn and generous with an unquenchable sense of humor. Michael was very devoted to his wife Lois, and his children Laura and David. In extending condolences to his family, I want them and his colleagues at the General Accounting Office to know that we, too, in the Senate will miss him. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of GAO reports by Michael Gutowski be placed in the Record.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Special Separation Benefits [SSB] Improvement Act of 1997. This legislation would address the unfair provision that double-taxes veterans who participate in the special separation benefits downsizing program run by the Department of Defense [DOD]. 
Since 1991, in an effort by the DOD to downsize the armed services, certain military personnel have been eligible for a special separation benefit [SSB]. However, since the inception of this program recipients who are subsequently determined to have a service-connected disability must offset the full SSB amount paid to that individual through the withholding of disability compensation by the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]. Because of these cost cutting provisions, veterans who participate in the DOD's downsizing by selecting an SSB lump sum payment are forced to pay back the full, pre-tax amount in disability compensation--offsetting money that the disabled veteran would never see. This is a gross injustice to veterans by double taxing their hard earned benefits. 
My bill would ease this double taxation for all members who accept an SSB package, and make these alterations retroactive to December 5, 1991. Thus, service members not able to receive payment concurrently since 1991 will be reimbursed for their lost compensation portion that was taxed. The near-term costs of this bill were estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be less than $500,000 through the year 2000 and about $2 million in 2002 --barely a fraction of a percentage of our annual spending on compensation and benefits for former military personnel. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting the double-taxing of veterans' benefits by the Government.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on Friday, September 26, 1997, I introduced legislation which amends title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA] to permit investment advisers registered with State securities regulators to continue to serve as investment managers to ERISA plans. At the end of last Congress, the Investment Supervision Coordination Act, landmark bipartisan legislation that adopted a new approach for regulating investment advisers, was passed and signed into law. Under this legislation, beginning July 8, 1997, States are assigned primary responsibility for regulating smaller investment advisers and the Securities and Exchange Commission is assigned primary responsibility for regulating larger investment advisers. Prior to the passage of the legislation, the issue arose that smaller investment advisers registered only with the States--and prohibited from registering with the SEC--would no longer meet the definition of investment manager under ERISA because the current Federal law definition only recognized advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a temporary measure, a 2-year sunset provision was included in the securities reform legislation extending the qualification of State registered investment advisers as investment managers under ERISA for 2 years. The purpose of this provision was to address the problem on an immediate basis while concurrently giving the congressional committees with jurisdiction over ERISA matters the opportunity to review and act on the issue. We have reviewed this issue and have developed the legislation that I am introducing today to permanently correct this problem. 
Without this legislation, State licensed investment advisers who, because of the securities reform legislation, no longer are permitted to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission will be unable to continue to be qualified to serve as investment managers to pension and welfare plans covered by ERISA. Without this legislation, the practices of thousands of small investment advisers, investment advisory firms and their supervision of client 401(k) and certain other pension plans will be seriously disrupted after October 10, 1998. 
For business reasons, it is necessary for an investment adviser seeking to advise and manage assets of employee benefit plans subject to ERISA to meet ERISA's definition of investment manager. It is also important, for business reasons, to eliminate the uncertainty about the status of small investment advisers as investment managers under ERISA. This uncertainty makes it difficult for such advisers to acquire new ERISA plan clients and may well cause the loss of existing clients.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I don't anticipate taking very long. I want to raise a very important issue relative to the District of Columbia. First of all, I want to commend the subcommittee chairman. I served just ahead of him in that capacity. I know of the tremendous responsibility he has, and I have admired the way he has been handling his job. I have also admired the way they have put the bill together this year to help the city of Washington. 
But there are problems that are really beyond the possibility of the subcommittee to correct. These are what I want to discuss today. First of all, let us remember what the important issues facing this Nation are and reflect and look at the District of Columbia with respect to those. The District of Columbia, as we all know, is the Nation's Capital. But I think sometimes we Members have a tendency to forget that we are responsible now for the city of Washington. We, in 1974, turned the city over to home rule. As that experience turned out to be rife with difficulty for the residents of D.C., Congress made efforts to become more vigorously involved with the city's governance. By getting more directly involved, particularly with regard to the education system, we therefore made ourselves, the Members of this body and the House, directly responsible to the people of the District of Columbia. And furthermore, we became more directly responsible to the people of the Nation overall that we would have to do what is necessary to make this Capital a capital we can all be proud of. 
Can you be proud of the United States Capital when the top issue in this Nation right now is education and here in Washington we continue to have some of the lowest educational scores and standards in the country? We are doing our jobs as leaders in a major metropolitan area; how can we turn this city into a model for the Nation to show how we can take the cities and help them become educational enterprises that are functioning well and that are delivering our young people into society with the skills they need to be able to make this Nation strong? 
This is a national problem of the highest priority. But let us take a look at the District of Columbia and where we stand as far as what we are doing for it and the distance that we have to go. As I said, I had the job that the Senator from North Carolina has, the chairmanship of the subcommittee, and I took that responsibility very, very seriously. Working with Congressman Gunderson on the other side, we developed an educational program for the city. We worked long and hard at it. We got it approved, and it is in law. It sets out the goals and methodology and the means for us to take this city and turn it from the worst--and I will explain that later--in educational results of any city in this country. 
Second--and I will talk about that even more quickly--we also have about the worst infrastructure of any school system in this country--the worst. So if we are going to make real progress in turning this education system around we have a long way to go. 
We set the framework a couple years ago when we took over the city. We created, first, the Control Board, which now has more of the mayoral responsibilities, or is more analogous to a board of aldermen. They then created a school board to take a look and see what they could do to take this city and to change it into a city that we could be proud of. 
We have all recently noted that the schools didn't open on time. Children were ready to come in, but the roofs were leaking, books had not been delivered. What happened? We had an amount of money for emergency repairs that had been appropriated--but that money, about $86 million came from the remainder of existing funds, and other one-time piece meal funding, not through a dedicated, sustainable revenue stream. It will just not be the right way to go to meet the needs we have, particularly with regard to infrastructure. 
Take a look at this chart. You can see that if this situation is not the worst in the Nation, it is pretty close. 
Look at these statistics from a General Services Administration study, which I will make a part of the Record, which goes through these infrastructure categories item-by-item to show where this city is. 
Exterior walls: The national average for having problems is 27 percent. We have 72 percent of our exterior walls and windows which are bad and not meeting codes. 
Next one: Roofs. This probably has improved a little since we spent $70 million fixing roofs this fall. But a year ago, only 27 percent of the schools in this country had poor roofs--but in the District we had 60-some percent of the roofs that were not meeting code. This does not mean they are beautiful; they just do not meet the code and safety violations. 
Heating and ventilation, and air conditioning: The national average, 36 percent below code; Washington D.C., 66 percent. 
Plumbing: Sixty-five percent of the plumbing doesn't meet code in D.C.'s schools--65 percent. 
Electrical and lighting: Fifty-three percent of the District's school's are in code violations in this category 
Life safety codes: Fifty-one percent of our schools are in violation of life safety codes. Would you trust your own children to that? I think not. 
Power for technology: This is where we are doing the best, fortunately. But, still, 41 percent of the schools don't have power to utilize technology. 
I am talking here about the Nation's Capital, the city that we would like to point to to show as an example of how a school system should be run. 
Keep that in mind. 
Let's take a look at this next chart to see what is going to happen. 
For 3 years in a row we have had the schools not opened on time because of violations. Well, this is according to the GSA. The amount of repairs, cost of repairs to meet code, plus some other essential repair: $2 billion--that is with a `b'--2 billion dollars' worth of repairs that are necessary in order to get our schools in compliance with the safety codes and other codes. 
We managed to get $86 million available this year. That was the high point. We put $50 million the year before. Divide $86 million into $2 billion, and you will see that somewhere between 20, 30, or 40 years from now depending on what you spend each year, those schools are going to be in code--our Nation's Capital. 
That is inexcusable. You tell me how we are going to get $2 billion to be able to fix those schools. Is this subcommittee going to appropriate $2 billion? Of course not. 
I went from the Appropriations Committee to the Finance Committee, because I knew that was where the action was going to be. There is a lot of money out of there--$35 billion for education. 
So to the Finance Committee, I said, `Hey. We ought to fix these schools.' So I had an amendment to get $1 billion--only one $1 billion--to get half the job done. I came within one vote of passing that in the Finance Committee. That was one of those meetings in the middle of the night where nobody was quite present. But, anyway, I came within one vote of getting it. I finally got $50 million. That would have paid part of this year. 
We went to conference. And they said, `No. We would much rather create more jobs in the city. We would much rather give things like tax credits for buying new houses, and all of these kinds of things.' So I went after the $50 million. But I did get a commitment from the head of OMB. I will get into that in the later part of the discussion here. But he agreed with me that we ought to do something, and that he would go with me and travel and talk with the Governors of Maryland and Virginia. I intend to do that, and see whether we can work something out. That will get to the solution which I will get to a little later. 
Now let's take a look at where we are as far as the achievement of our young people and take a look at this, if you want to get depressed. 
This chart shows where the District of Columbia is in red. We put the District of Columbia in red each time where it belongs. And this shows the Northeast average; the national average levels. These are fourth grade students scored at or above basic reading achievement levels. And it was down 6 percent from 1992. We took these from 1994. Twenty-eight percent of the children in the District of Columbia were passing the assessment for reading. In 1993, it went down 6 percent to 22 percent. 
If we are going to make the District of Columbia the model for the Nation to follow, we are kind of headed in the wrong direction. 
So what are we going to do about that? I will also get to that in a little bit. Right now I think it would be appropriate to go to the next phase where I am going to offer the amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thought that last sentence might stir up some anxiety. So I wanted to make sure that I reassured Senators that I would withdraw it. 
But I did want to reemphasize that I intend to meet with the OMB director and with the Governors of Maryland and Virginia, and lay out this plan which will help the District. But it will also help the two surrounding States. So hopefully we can get an 
agreement to go forward with this, if we could, one, raise the $2 billion to take care of the infrastructure problem; and, two, share 50-50 the ability to create the kind of skilled training that is necessary in this metropolitan area in order to provide skilled workers for the 50,000 jobs that are available in this region which are not being filled at this time. 
Before I go on, I want to say that the things which I am saying here and recommending are not things that Jim Jeffords decided when he was losing his mind or something, as somebody would think about standing up here and trying to help the District of Columbia. But this book everyone ought to be required to read in the Congress, which is `The Orphaned Capital,' and it is by Carol O'Clanahan, at the Brookings Institution. 
This was done on behalf of the city to explain the mess we are in, and possible solutions as to how to get out of the mess. 
So, again I want to emphasize that what I am trying to do today is to challenge the delegations from Maryland and Virginia, or anybody else, to say show me if you have a better way to come up with $2 billion so that we are not embarrassed by having our schools shut down. Let me tell you why they will end up shutting down again if we don't come up with something. 
There is a group called Parents United. And they are upset with the fact that their kids are going to schools that are unsafe. So each year they go to a judge who is very friendly to them and who likes to make us look stupid. So that judge shuts the schools down each year. And they have about 20 to 40 years to go, depending on how much we put up each year with these code violations. 
So they will pick on a number of code violations. The boilers are about to blow in several of the schools. So maybe this winter the Christmas holidays may get extended, if they decide to go and get the boilers fixed, although I hope they will be able to fix the boilers without that. 
But anyway, they will each time go, and they will get the court to order the schools to be repaired. But as you say, with $2 billion to go in doing it with $50 million to $80 million a year, it will take a while. I don't want to have to spend the rest of my time here being embarrassed every year about why these schools are not being opened. 
So let's take a look at what the positive side of the events are. Let me tell you what we have here, just to give you some credence on what I am saying. Look at this Washington Post editorial the shortage of workers in this regional area for the information technology jobs available. 
But, as I mentioned earlier, there is a serious labor market shortage in this area. We have a burgeoning development of technology-based jobs--not only in the information industry but in every sector of our economy. These jobs are available in a location that's nice and convenient to the Capitol. There are 50,000 jobs out there right now that cannot be filled. And these are $20- $30- and $40-an-hour jobs that cannot be filled because the schools, the high schools in this area, even though we have some good ones out in the suburbs, are not graduating people from high school with the capacity they should have to take these jobs. I want to mention this to give you an idea of the dimension of the problem. 
If we could fill these jobs, it would increase the revenues in the area available by $3.5 billion annually. We are talking about an enormous amount. Keep that figure in mind. That is the potential that we could do. Keep also in mind the fact that in this city now two-thirds of the workers are living in the suburbs. That is up by one-half from several years ago when everybody flooded out of the city. 
I will remind you. Why did they flood out? Two reasons: One, crime; and, back and forth between number one and two, the schools. The schools are lousy. I am not going to bring my kids up here. I am taking them to the suburbs. 
So now two-thirds of the workers go out. Do you know what 
they take with them? They take with them $20 billion a year--$20 billion a year that goes out to be taxed by Virginia and Maryland. Do you want to know why Virginia and Maryland are going to get upset? Because if I try to take some of that, wow. That is going to be revenue out of their pockets. 
That is why I want to emphasize that if we increase the revenues by $3.5 billion, it will help reduce the impact of removing it. And we are not going to take all of it anyway. How much comes back in from people working out? One percent of that. One percent comes from workers working out of the District--outside the District, coming back into the District. It is a huge disparity. 
Another fact that I want to mention--this one is very, very important to remember. Washington, DC, is the only city in America which is in an interstate area where its workers cannot--cannot--be taxed on their wages before they go home. It is the only city in America that is in that situation. All of the cities that are in an interstate situation have taxes on the nonresidents. So part of the work revenue stays. The highest I think is 4 percent. The average is around 2 or 3 percent. Just keep that figure in mind because you have a huge amount of money that flows out of the District into Maryland and Virginia, which grab hold of it and throw into their treasury. Everybody would like to be able to do that. 
So that is the situation we are in. 
Now the question is, How can we make an equitable system, granted that this city is restrained? How are we restrained? Let me tell you how that happened. Back in 1974, when the District of Columbia went to home rule, a very astute Member of the House said, `Hey. Every other city in this country grabs money from the workers.' 
And that Representative was from Virginia, naturally, and offered an amendment which passed that said the District of Columbia is prohibited from taxing workers, nonresident workers. And that is still in the law. So right now, unlike any other city in America in a similar situation, the District of Columbia cannot tax the nonresident income. 
Well, it seemed to me that under that circumstance it would be appropriate to take a look to see if we could not just nick it and take some money back to float the bond for the $2 billion needed for the infrastructure code repairs. 
That is what this amendment does. But in addition to that, to be more wise and also make it more appealing, my amendment will take money from the nonresident workers, the tax money that goes to Annapolis and Richmond, and bring it back into counties of Maryland and Virginia that border the District of Columbia. 
So in the final analysis we start out and ease it in, phase it in so that it would have a slow differential in the impact it has on those States starting off with money to repair the schools. That will take about 1 percent. We could phase that in in a couple years. One percent would take care of the bonds to raise $2 billion. Then, if we can go to 3 percent, split that so that it equals half the money going to the suburbs and half to the District of Columbia--that is including the infrastructure repairs--we can then create what needs to be done, a system to be able to coordinate the schools in these areas to find out where best to have skill training. For instance, I would recommend we take UDC, the University of the District of Columbia, and make it into a skill training center. Give it a new purpose. It could be used for those purposes. And these grants would be given out in cooperation with the Department of Education and the Department of Labor. I did not want to give it to the Federal Government, but that does make it necessary for interstate compacts. So then we could create the system. 
Let's take a look back at the Washington Post. What it is talking about is where the jobless could be given jobs. I want to give validity to what I am saying. They are aware of this. The business community is also aware of what I am trying to do and very supportive, and the educators are, of course, too.  
I have spoken with the leaders of the exploding high-technology industry from Virginia and Maryland, and they note that the boom has been so dramatic that they're worried about finding enough people to work for them. Then note the plight of the District, where businesses evaporate and unemployment is the highest in the region. The obvious but so far elusive solution: match the District of Columbia jobless with Northern Virginia jobs. 
So this is known as an area of need. So what I am recommending with this amendment is that we ought to work together as a region. And this can be done nationally. I would say the Senator from North Carolina, when we discussed this some time ago, pointed out in North Carolina they have developed these things, and the South has been very astute. We in the Northeast and the rest of the country ought to be aware of what they are doing. They are working together in a region. They are inviting businesses to come in. They are creating skill training in order to make sure that they can get the jobs and get the businesses to locate in their States to provide them with what is necessary. 
Now, I am hopeful that when the other States look at this they will realize, if we come in and just take a little bit of the money, which any other city in this country could do that is in this interstate situation, we must make sure we turn this city around and move it in the right direction, first, by fixing up the schools. 
Now, certainly I am embarrassed, and I hope all of my colleagues are embarrassed, by the fact that this city has the worst school infrastructure in the country and that such a huge number of our schools are unfit. With $2 billion, I hope they would take notice and join me in trying to do something about it. 
But I also point out that it does not make any difference to me how we do it. I would challenge the Senators from Virginia and Maryland, if they do not like the fact that some of the money may be taken from their State capitals and moved down into their counties near here or some into the District of Columbia, then suggest another alternative. I urge any of my colleagues to figure out how we can raise $2 billion over the next couple years so that we can get these schools fixed so we do not have to go through the difficult period of time each year of being embarrassed by the District of Columbia school system. 
In winding up, I urge that we will get your attention because I think it is easy for us, as so many Members do when I talk to them, to say, `Oh, that's Mayor Marion Barry's problem. He made a mess out of it.' That may be true. But that is not the solution. We are responsible. We are the ones who have to come up with a solution, and if we do not do it, then I am sad for the kids in these schools. I am sad for the city, and I am sad for all of us who will be embarrassed, instead of having the Nation's Capital pointed to, as it could be, as a model to follow, and ridiculed and we feel so sorry for those kids. 
Now, let me talk a little bit also about other things that can be done to help the city and that are being done. I have lived here now close to 25 years. I have lived right in the District. I have not gone out to the suburbs so I know what's going on here and I have seen it improved; I have seen it getting better; but I feel very responsible for it. And so I hope that we will see as we move forward that we can change this city around. I am hopeful that we will have that responsibility, recognize it and do something about it. 
In addition to what I have already told you about, I would also like to mention what the private sector has been doing to assist. We ought to keep our eye on the private sector because they are showing us their ability through volunteering. 
Let me talk about two programs that I have been working with the private sector. One looks at one of the most difficult problems the Nation has, and that is reading. You saw the record, the horrible record of the District of Columbia in reading. We have started a program called `Everybody Wins!' This is a lunchtime volunteer reading program that pairs caring adults with elementary school children in Title 1 schools to help them learn to read and learn the value of reading and education. Senate volunteers go every Tuesday to the Brent School to read over here on the Hill and the House volunteers go down to the John Tyler school. All in all we now have around 300 House and Senate staff who read in the program. We began `Everybody Wins!' up here on the Hill to generate awareness with the private sector and others of how fantastic a program it is and how easy and effective it is to get involved and this year we will have about 1,200 volunteers all across the city who are reading to kids in first through sixth grades to make sure at the end of the third grade they know how to read--a great program. It is a non-profit educational foundation funded by the private sector, with the whole effort led by the PGA Tour and the Tour Wives Association. The PGA Tour is under the leadership of Commissioner Tim Finchem, who is really making children and education a priority, and I commend him for all his help. We have been able to raise some money each year at a fundraiser called `Links to Literacy.' The entire House and Senate leadership from both sides of the aisle joined me and Senator Kennedy in spearheading this event. We will have another fundraiser this spring where `everybody wins' so that we can make progress toward our goal of having every elementary school child in the D.C. public schools read with an adult volunteer once a week at lunchtime. 
Secondly, the area of greatest difficulty--and here is another area where the District of Columbia leads the Nation, I think--is school dropouts. Forty percent of the kids in the District of Columbia system who start do not finish, and that I 
tell you is very much related to the serious crime problem because 80 percent of the people that are in jails are school dropouts. 
I traveled out to San Diego and visited a program there which was set up by the private sector called `Operation FitKids.' This program was founded by a man named Ken Germano who works in the fitness industry and who is passionately dedicated to underprivileged kids. He figured out a way for the fitness industry to donate used equipment to schools to create safe, educational fitness centers in the middle and high schools. Now you have to have the biggest and best equipment in order to attract people. I know I watch television. Every couple weeks there is a new way to tread the mill and those kinds of things. My colleague Senator Kohl has joined with me to bring this great program to the District of Columbia. This summer we were able to have half a million dollars worth of equipment that has been donated to four of the middle schools and high schools in our city's worst areas to help young people with a place to go to exercise and to communicate with each other and to learn life-long healthy habits. To make this work we had to form a partnership with a local university and American University stepped right up to the plate and we now will have a big launch event this Fall to get the word out about how more people can get involved. 
Another area. Representative Cass Ballenger has been working with the private sector and contractors, saying, will you help? Will you help do things with a little money? In other words, try to get donated whatever is needed to help fix these schools. And they say yes. Ballenger said, well, the problem is we can't do much about it because of the Davis-Bacon Act. And hopefully at the same time we do this we could get an agreement to lift the Davis-Bacon Act, or at least the size of contracts which are needed to be met so that we could take that money and do it with much less by being able to get around the Davis-Bacon Act. 
So the private sector is ready to help. I am certainly ready to help. A number of my colleagues are. But it is up to the rest of the Senate and the House to really say we are going to make this capital the best in the country, not the worst. And right now we are embarrassed, and I am embarrassed, but I am hopeful a year from now we will be on the road to progress and I am going to do everything I can to make sure that we are on that road. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to yield back the remainder of my time. I withdraw my amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Senator Frist, especially for his most recent discussion. 
We have been concentrating on one small part of this bill--small in the sense of the number of pages or words relative to the rest of the bill, and by outlining and expressing the tremendous advancements we made in many of these areas in this bill, which has kind of gotten lost in the dialog, especially in the off-label use which has been a very contentious issue. But I think the resolution which you and Senator Mack, working with Senator Kennedy, myself and others have come up with is a tremendous step forward in preventing such things that have occurred in fen/phen and things like that, and making sure we exchange knowledge and that we work together to improve what can be improved. 
I deeply appreciate the comments of the Senator and all the work the Senator has put into this bill. Your expertise and your knowledge has been a reward to us and has given us confidence that we have done the right thing. You have done a fantastic job and it is deeply appreciated. I yield the floor.

Mr. President, the goal of this legislation is to ensure a strong and efficient FDA. 
The modernization and revitalization provision included in S. 830 makes for a better FDA--not a weaker one, as some have suggested. 
Like many of my colleagues, I have had the opportunity to meet with industry groups here in Washington, and with consumers, patients, and physicians--both here and at my home in Vermont. All of these interested parties have made important points about how to modernize the agency while ensuring that its stellar standards for public safety remain as strong as ever. Though the large industries regulated by FDA are by and large not present in Vermont, all of us use their products. The people and the patient advocates in Vermont have told me that more needs to be done to ensure their timely access to the best therapies available. 
I believe we have accomplished that with this bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Maryland for raising this very important point. As with the 1992 law, I intend that the FDA's performance goals that have been worked out between FDA and industry in the PDUFA reauthorization be covered in a separate letter. The letter will be sent by Secretary Shalala to Chairman Bliley and me, as well as the distinguished ranking members of the House Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, and our committee, Mr. Kennedy. 
This letter is referenced in the findings section of the user fees provisions of the bill. It will spell out in detail the performance goals that FDA has agreed to meet for each of the 5 years of the reauthorized user fee law. 
I consider the provisions that will be in the Secretary's letter and attachment to be as mandatory as if they were in the statute itself. I expect the FDA will treat them as such just as it has with the provisions in the 1992 letter.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I share the Senator's goal of ensuring a strong FDA and believe the modernization and revitalization provisions included in S. 830 make for a better FDA, not a weaker one. Like you I have had the opportunity to meet with industry groups here in Washington and with consumers, patients, and physicians both here and at home in Vermont. All of these interested parties have made important points about how to modernize the agency while ensuring that its stellar standard for public safety remain as strong as ever. Though Vermont doesn't have any of these large industries regulated by the FDA, all of us use their products. The people and the patient advocates of Vermont have told me that more needs to be done to ensure their timely access to the best therapies available. I believe we have accomplished that with this bill. 
I think that the Senator from Washington would agree that it's important to put aside once and for all that consumers, patients, and physicians universally oppose this measure. Vermont patient groups and their members--and I'm sure you have heard from your constituents--have told me that they support this effort to modernize the FDA. The Vermont Epilepsy Association, the Vermont Medical Society, the Vermont Association for the Deaf, the Vermont Board of Pharmacy, the Vermont Alliance for the Mentally Ill, and the Epilepsy Foundation of Vermont have all urged passage of the measure. At the national level we have heard from innumerable groups that support S. 830 and urge its passage. For example, the National Health Council--which includes the Arthritis Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Leukemia Society among its over 100 member organizations--took out a full-page advertisement in the Roll Call newspaper urging that the Senate move forward with this legislation. 
I agree with my colleague from Washington and you can be assured that if problems do arise, I would act quickly to address any threat to the public health. Simply because we are authorizing PDUFA for 5 years does not mean that we cannot change other sections of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. It could also turn out that some of these reforms, like expanded third party review for medical devices, will become such a success that the FDA will want to extend the program beyond the pilot phase. 
Effective and aggressive oversight is one of the most important tools of the Labor and Human Resources Committee for making sure that the FDA can keep pace with the rapid changes in medical technology and still be a public health agency that is the envy of the world. I thank the Senator for her commitment to working toward real reforms that strengthen the FDA and the contributions she has made in crafting this bipartisan measure.

His steadfast and articulate objection to the 20th, relative to section 404, has been done sincerely and very well done on that issue. I believe that we have a good bill, but we remain open to suggestions, as always, as to how the bill can be improved. I am extremely pleased that the Senate has overwhelmingly approved S. 830 yesterday. I believe this is an important step forward for ensuring a stronger and more efficient FDA. 
Throughout this process, we have had the benefit of input from all interested parties on how best to modernize the Agency, while ensuring that its stellar standard for public safety remains as strong as ever. I am extremely proud of the strong support of this legislation expressed by the health community. For instance, the National Health Council, a coalition of over 100 health and patient organizations, has urged the Senate to move forward with this legislation. We have also received support from physician groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
We must remember that drugs and medical devices delayed at the FDA are often lives lost. 
When cardiac defibrillators were first developed in the late 1980's, they brought new hope and opportunity to many of the 350,000 Americans who would otherwise suffer sudden cardiac death each year. 
But the first version of this technology required opening the chest and separating the ribs to apply this technology to the heart. This procedure carried a 4.2 percent mortality rate. 
Improvements to this defibrillator technology were widely available in Europe two years before patients could benefit in this country. The new technology did not require cracking the patients chest, but only a small incision to allow the technology to be threaded through a vein into the heart. 
During this unnecessary 2-year delay, it is estimated that 1,056 Americans died from complications related to the more invasive technique. Delay does cost lives. 
And far from allowing dangerous products on the market as Senator Kennedy has alleged, section 404 of this bill keeps intact FDA's authority to investigate technological issues which raise new safety and effectiveness questions, does not limit FDA's enforcement authority, and does not touch FDA's regulations which require that medical device applications be truthful and not omit any material facts. 
Section 404 does quite appropriately keep FDA out of regulating the practice of medicine. That is important and we should fight to protect the intent of this provision. 
Patients will also benefit from other provisions of the bill including the registry of clinical trials, fast-track approval for drugs treating life-threatening diseases, expanded access to investigational therapies, and the incentives established to investigate pediatric uses of drugs. 
I want to thank the patient, consumer, and physician groups, and all the others we have worked with, for their commitment to working toward real reforms that strengthen the FDA and the contributions they have made in crafting this bipartisan measure. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

This is an incredibly important amendment that Senator Mack and Senator Frist have worked out with the FDA and the minority. That is going to give a great deal of assistance to people in this country who are in need of help in straightening out a relatively difficult area with such preciseness. The Senator from Florida did a good job.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and I thank them profusely for their vote, for their support in the committee, and all the work that has gone into this. But, as we all know, there are people who work behind the scenes, those who are probably more responsible for this vote than we on the floor are. I just want to take a moment to thank the staff. 
In the office of Senate Legislative Counsel, Robin Bates, Elizabeth Aldridge, and Bill Baird worked tirelessly to produce countless bill drafts and amendments. And how they came out with them as expeditiously as they did, I'm not sure. 
The staff at CRS, especially Donna Vogt, and at GAO, including Bernice Steinhardt deserve thanks for their willingness to provide essential information and documents on extremely short notice. We must always remember to appreciate these organizations that provide so much assistance to the Congress. 
The staff to the members of the committee contributed greatly to the success of this bill. In particular, Vince Ventimiglia with Senator Coats' staff worked closely with ours in a true partnership on all aspects of S. 830. 
In addition, Kimberly Spaulding with Senator Gregg, Sue Ramthun with Senator Frist, Saira Sultan with Senator DeWine, and Kate Lambrew-Hull with Senator Hutchinson all played important roles in fashioning compromises on key provisions of this bill. Also, Mark Smith with Senator Mack's staff worked very hard to make the agreement on off-label dissemination of information possible. 
I would also like to thank the many staff of the administration who have worked on this legislation. 
In particular, I want to thank Bill Schultz, Diane Thompson, and Peggy Dotzel, of the FDA. 
Similarly, three staffers for members of the minority on the committee played pivotal roles even before committee markup took place in making this bill a bipartisan success. 
Lynne Lawrence with Senator Mikulski deserves special mention in recognition of her hard work in the last Congress on FDA reform and her willingness to put her future career plans on hold to commit herself again to the long hard job of bringing this bill to the floor this year. Jeanne Ireland with Senator Dodd and Linda DeGutis, a fellow with Senator Wellstone also provided invaluable assistance. 
Of course I would like to thank the Labor and Human Resources Committee majority and minority staffs who did the most work on this. In particular, I want to recognize Susan Hattan who stayed on with the committee after Senator Kassebaum's retirement. 
She, and another Senator Kassebaum staffer, Jane Williams, who is now on the staff of Representative Fred Upton, worked long hours last year to put FDA reform on the Senate agenda and brought a bill to successful committee markup in the last Congress--we stand here today in large part due to their hard work. 
On the minority staff, I would like to thank Nick Littlefield and David Nexon and two minority fellows Diane Robertson and Debbie Kochever. Finally, I would like to thank the majority staff director Mark Powden, Jay Hawkins, and majority fellow Sean Donohue. 
I want to take a moment to elaborate on my comments regarding one of the majority staff who has worked so diligently on this measure--Jay Hawkins. Jay joined my staff in January--literally hit the ground running--and I don't think he has stopped moving since. 
He has set a new standard of dedication for professional staff to find the best solution in a difficult and controversial policy arena. He has been saluted by other Senators' staffs, from both majority and minority offices, for his willingness to include them in all aspects of this effort. 
Mr. President, part of the job description for Senate staff is to take abuse. Jay unfortunately received more than his share, but it said more about his critics than him. 
More recently--a little more than a month ago--Jay lost his mother to her 4-year battle with cancer. My friend, Senator Hatch, acknowledged on the floor just yesterday this hardship Jay faced and was eloquent in his praise for both Jay and for his mother--Donna Lotz Hawkins. Mrs. Hawkins was not unfamiliar with challenge and adversity. She was an experienced mountain climber and conquered some of the world's most difficult mountains in the Alaska range, the Tetons, the Alps, and the Himalayas. She was a dedicated ocean swimmer and conquered the white waters in Waikiki and Maui. 
It is clear to us who know Jay that he too has the spirit of taking on the task when faced with adversity and challenge. We know the source of that sense of commitment and we cannot thank him enough for his efforts on this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we close debate on this issue, I want to say if I listened to this and didn't understand the law and the protections in it, I would go home and be depressed that I was backing such legislation. However, knowing the law and knowing the process, I still come away totally opposed to this amendment. 
First of all, let's take a look. We have had about 36,000 devices approved over the past 6 years. Out of that, there would have been six recalls. So this is not an issue that is something which has proved to be a failure in the law. 
Second, what we are dealing with here is the definition of false and misleading. Actually, the regulations cover the important aspects of it. But false and misleading means if you knew or should have known. They want to get into the practice of medicine. They want to say if this person has this device, and it is the same as the device with the premarket approval, they should be looking around and deciding and finding out all the possible and conceivable uses out there, and then they could be required to run clinical trials on all these. 
The purpose of the 510(k) process is to allow something that is identically the same, having gone through all this, not to have to go through it again. This would send fear through the device industry because it may know it is impossible to get anything improved again without expending thousands and thousands of dollars and waiting 2 or 3 years. That is totally unnecessary. The law fully protects the consumer now. This is totally unnecessary and will increase the cost to consumers and decrease the availability of devices to them in a timely manner. That is why I am opposed to it. 
It has been greatly overexaggerated as to what kind of problem is created here. 
Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. This amendment I believe will address the concerns of several Senators who have a concern regarding the effect of this legislation on FDA's authority to regulate tobacco. I believe we all have the same intent. 
In drafting S. 830, my intent was and is to improve the efficiency and accountability of the product review process at FDA. In drafting section 404, we modified a provision in the FDA reform bill from the 104th Congress in an effort to more accurately capture our policy intent--my point is that the subject matter is section 404 has been under consideration in the Senate Labor Committee, as well as in legislation introduced in the House, for several years. The concern over FDA's tobacco authority came to our attention only after the markup of this bill in committee, in June of this year. 
Section 404 introduces needed elements of due process to certain, very limited aspects of medical device reviews. None of the language in S. 830 is intended to address FDA's tobacco authority. Late in the course of negotiations on this bill, FDA raised the possibility that section 404(b) might be interpreted to limit the agency's future tobacco regulation authority. At the time we told the agency we did not agree with their interpretation but eventually offered to insert the rule of construction now before us in the substitute to make absolutely clear our neutrality on the tobacco issue. Subsequently, FDA and others have raised the possibility that section 404(a) of S. 830 could also affect FDA's authority in this area. As you mentioned, the Congressional Research Service, American Law Division, has evaluated S. 830 and determined that it, in fact, does not interfere with any tobacco authority FDA may have. This analysis was made part of the Congressional Record on September 5. 
None of the provisions of S. 830 or the substitute should be interpreted as taking a position, one way or the other, on whether FDA has any authority under current law to regulate tobacco products, which as you know, is the subject of ongoing litigation in the Federal courts. The intention of the rule of construction in the substitute is to make clear that the Federal courts can continue 
to determine FDA's authority over tobacco without any interference from this act. Thus, the language in section 404 has no effect on whether or not FDA has authority over tobacco products, it only relates to a procedural aspect of reviewing 510(k) medical device submissions. 
To sum up, I am pleased to offer an amendment extending the rule of construction to all of section 404 on the basis outlined in my preceding remarks--to keep the bill strictly neutral on the question of FDA tobacco authority, that is that we are not prejudging the outcome of any pending litigation on any tobacco authority the FDA may have. Further, it is my view that if this provision is included in the final FDA reform bill as reported by the conference committee, the conference report should include language which reinforces this point.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate is immediately resuming consideration of S. 830, the FDA reform legislation. In a moment we will begin two consecutive rollcall votes on or in relation to the pending amendments offered by Senator Durbin. Following those votes, additional amendments are expected and therefore rollcall votes will occur throughout the day. 
Under the consent agreement there are 5 hours remaining for debate prior to a vote on the pending substitute amendment. I hope that once the debate time has expired, the Senate will be able to proceed to a vote and then passage of this important legislation. 
The majority leader has also stated that this week the Senate will consider the D.C. appropriations bill and any appropriations conference reports that become available. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senator's amendment at best duplicates the third-party conflict-of-interest protections in the bill and at worst unnecessarily constrains the agency. The ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, and the FDA join me in opposing this amendment. 
Section 204 of the bill provides a full statutory directive to the agency adopt measures within 180 days of enactment to prevent conflicts of interest that may be involved with both an individual reviewer and with the reviewing organization. As with Senator Durbin, this was a critical concern for members of the committee. 
Section 204 provides full discretion to the agency to develop appropriate standards. The agency will not be limited in any way in developing these guidelines. In fact, the agency has already developed extensive conflict-of-interest guidelines as part of its existing third-party program, including protections from situations such as if the third party or any of its personnel involved in 510(k) reviews has any ownership or other financial interest in any medical device, device manufacturer, or distributor. 
The Senator's concerns have caused us to reexamine the important issue of preventing conflicts of interest. We commend him for doing so, but I urge a no vote.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I disagree entirely with the statement made by the Senator from Illinois. The Senator's amendment strikes the agreement reached on these provisions among the bill's sponsors, the FDA, and Senator Kennedy. The FDA should have the discretion to decide when it makes sense to require device tracking or surveillance for a product. 
Current law requires tracking for certain product types and gives the FDA discretion to require tracking for other products. It is simply not necessary for every current and future device in the mandatory category to be subject to the tracking requirement. This provision allows FDA affirmatively to indicate which products in the mandatory category should be subject to tracking. FDA may use its discretion to add new products to the list of products which must be tracked, or put a product back on the list for tracking if evidence indicates the need. 
The FDA is overburdened. We want to free them up to do the things that need to be done. 
The FDA has publicly stated that it is unnecessary for all devices in the mandatory category--postmark and surveillance category--to be subject to its postapproval evaluation. 
I urge defeat of the amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. My colleague from Rhode Island is a welcome addition to the Labor Committee. He has been active and has made some good suggestions for improving this legislation, but this is not one of them. 
This amendment sounds like simple good Government but in fact would gut the provision and 20 years of effective medical device regulation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me try to remove some of the confusion that I think must exist. Certainly the Senator from Massachusetts most eloquently has expressed his feelings, but his feelings and the law are not necessarily the same. 
I point out, first of all, that false statements, all these kinds of problems, are certainly reachable. Let us get back to where we are. Let us remove first a couple of the things that have been invoked here in the discussion. Fen/phen, for instance. Fen/phen deals with drugs, not with devices. So do not get that confused with this particular situation here. 
In addition to that, I point out that because of the off-label use of drugs, this committee appropriately put in place a system which would have probably even prevented fen/phen but at least would have made it possible for the FDA to intervene through the knowledge that they might not have had. So I want to take that completely out. That just raises insecurities in people which is inappropriate under this legislation. 
Second, with respect to the debate on devices, I think it is important that we take a look at what we are talking about here. Devices are different from drugs. Devices have to do with things which are implanted in you or are used like the neck collar, whatever else, which do require approval. 
There are two ways to approve these matters. One is the PMA, the premarketing approval. 
The amendment that they are asking for would require not only the premarketing analysis but would move the same kinds of standards which are in the premarketing approval process over to the 510(k) process. 
Why is that? First of all, the premarket approval is the one which requires all the clinical trials and tests and which makes it very clear as to whether a device is going to create a threat. 
Let us put that into dimension here. Just in the 510(k) process, there were over 5,000 a year. Over the last 6 years that has been about 30,000 devices. There have only been five or six that have created any problem which required mandatory recall. 
So that evidence is with respect to two points: First, these are rare things and, second, there is the present ability to handle those situations. 
So by putting in these words `false and misleading,' you take this device basically and move it back in under the premarketing approval process because, if you have to approve everything, if you have the duty of going out and inquiring among doctors, `Are you using this device which has already been approved?' and you say, `I have something which is substantially equivalent to be used for that purpose,' they would have the burden of going out among the doctors and finding out what the practice of medicine is and whether their device was being used for something other than what it was approved for under the premarketing approval process. 
That means a huge increase in costs to each of these companies that are trying to get something on the market to compete with the one that is already on the market. This creates huge delays. And for what reason? For no real purpose because it is only going to be used for that use intended unless 
somebody decides to use it otherwise. 
So I think we have to remember here there is authority under the law for those people who abuse the process. But one of the purposes of the 510(k) was to reduce the time so that competition can get out there with a better device and bring the costs down because there would be no longer a monopoly in that situation. 
The second purpose is to relieve the FDA from having to recheck and reexamine a device which is substantially or equivalent to the one that has already been studied and require the FDA to go out and examine all the doctors, all those kinds of things and create a huge burden on the FDA. 
So our purpose here in the bill is to make sure that we have an efficient, effective FDA with adequate resources to do their job. So I want to make it clear as to what the discussion is supposed to be about. I also remind you that the 510(k) process only applies to those devices which are not life threatening, so they are not the devices that would do the kind of horrendous things that the Senator from Massachusetts has alluded to. 
I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, first, let me very briefly review where we are. There has been considerable debate up to this point. I think it is important for me as the chairman of the committee to remind people as to where we are. 
We have before us a 152-page bill, which is the first real overhaul of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the last 30 years. We have taken little tweaks here and there, but it has not been thoroughly reviewed and brought into the modern world. 
Out of that 152 pages, we are now spending most of the time debating on 2 or 3 pages. That is why the minority ranking member has praised the bill, but then picked on one--basically, we are here because of one provision, which is 404. On some standards, we cannot agree on the precise wording. 
So everybody agrees on almost all of this bill. The amendment that is being offered by the Senator from Illinois does get into a very, very important area, and we do not disagree with that. We praise him for having given us the opportunity to review, to restudy, and determine as to whether or not the provision he is striking with his amendment and replacing is necessary or appropriate. We have concluded--I say `we' because I am sure that Senator Kennedy joins me in this statement--that we adequately take care of the conflict of interest in this bill. 
Let me go through what his amendment attempts to do and what the bill provides. First of all, the Senator's amendment, at best, duplicates the third-party provision that we have in the bill now and, at worst, it unnecessarily constrains the agency. 
Section 204, conflict of interest protections, which is being stricken and replaced, provides a full statutory directive to the agency to prevent conflicts of interest that may be involved with both an individual reviewer and with the reviewing organization. As with Senator Durbin, this was a critical concern for members of the committee. 
Section 204(b) reads: 
Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary shall adopt methods of accreditation that ensure that entities or individuals who conduct reviews and make recommendations under this section are . . . free of conflicts of interest. 
Section 204 provides full discretion to the agency to develop appropriate standards. The agency will not be limited in any way in developing these guidelines. 
We believe the FDA is the one that can best understand what will be effective in this regard. The agency has already developed extensive conflict of interest guidelines as a part of its existing third-party program. The notice of April 3rd, 1996, has almost a full page of Federal Register type laying out the standards, including restrictions if `the third party, or any of its personnel, involved in 510(k) reviews has any ownership, or other financial interest, in medical device, device manufacturer, or distributor.' 
That is a quote from the wording. 
The agency has not identified any difficulties in the implementation of the conflict of interest guidelines, and it has expressed no concern about the conflict of interest provisions, as drafted. We have reviewed the FDA standards that appeared in the Federal Register on Wednesday, April 3, 1996, at page 14794, and believe that they adequately and appropriately address the problems which we are reviewing here. The agency's strict guidelines resulted in the elimination of 30 of the 37 applicants that originally sought accreditation. That means, obviously, that the FDA policy is effective, and it has outlined and again recognized--as the Senator from Illinois is aware--that there are problems that must be protected against. And we agree with him on that. 
The Durbin amendment attempts to set standards but in fact may constrain the agency. In fact, the standards cited are reportedly outdated and do not reflect recent revision. This may explain why in the second part of the amendment Senator Durbin effectively gives the agency discretion to craft appropriate guidelines. Section 204 provides a full statutory directive to the agency to prevent conflicts of interest that may be involved with both an individual reviewer and the reviewing organization. Therefore, it appears to us that the amendment, although well-intended, may even make it more complicated than necessary, and that we will end up perhaps with a less effective system than is already contained in the bill. 
Madam President, I ask, if we yield back time, what happens to that time? May we be advised on that?

I think at this time I will just again restate that we believe that the bill as written adequately covers the problems of the conflict of interest situation. 
We commend the Senator from Illinois for really focusing attention on this and bringing it to our attention again so that all of my colleagues hopefully will understand that the bill--this is agreed to I believe also by Senator Kennedy--is effective in accomplishing the goals of the Senator from Illinois. 
So, again I commend him for what he has done.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I now return to the Durbin amendment. 
Section 605, is also the subject of bipartisan agreement, with FDA's concurrence. By way of brief explanation, device tracking is intended to facilitate a product recall. 
Current law requires tracking for certain product types and also gives FDA discretion to require tracking for other products. It simply is not necessary for every device in the mandatory category to be subject to the tracking requirement. This provision allows FDA to affirmatively indicate which products in the mandatory category should be subject to tracking. 
FDA may use its discretion to add new products to the list of products which must be tracked or put a product back on the list for tracking if evidence indicates the need. 
This provision is needed because today, FDA will often indicate to a manufacturer that a product need not be tracked, even if it is in the mandatory category. While this many be good policy in the specific case, it puts both the FDA and the manufacturer in an undesirable legal situation. This provision allows FDA to exercise proper discretion and removes any potential cloud of legal liability which exists today. 
It is inconceivable that FDA would not require tracking in the tragic cases identified by the Senator. The provision in the bill is logical, safe, and necessary. Further, the GAO report cited by the Senator refers to areas of FDA control totally unrelated to device tracking and surveillance. 
SECTION 606: POSTMARKET SURVEILLANCE 
Some have asked why we have made the FDA's postmarket surveillance authority discretionary. I am pleased to address that question and I think my colleagues will understand the good reasons for doing so. First, let me clearly state the FDA is in full concurrence with the appropriateness of this policy. I should add that FDA has actually required relatively few products to conduct postmarket surveillance. It is important to differentiate between this authority and the medical device reporting [MDR] and user reporting programs which are unaffected by this provision. The Medical Device Reporter Program is the keystone to the postapproval system for identifying hazardous or defective medical devices on the market place. The MDR Program, coupled with FDA's authority to force product recalls and the device tracking provisions are a strong web of protection for the consumer. User reports, submitted to FDA and manufacturers by hospitals and physicians, are an additional layer of information on the status of medical devices in the healthcare system. 
Postmarket surveillance has a different purpose--to gather additional data to provide the extra assurance in the relatively rare situation where FDA has approved a product, yet still believes that the product should be subject to a limited period of postmarket evaluation. This is because for certain types of devices, problems may arise years after approval--problems which may not be detected in even the most elaborate clinical trial but could be dangerous to the individual, or even life threatening. 
It is instructive to consider the history of this authority. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 included a provision requiring a manufacturer to conduct postmarket surveillance for any device first marketed after January 1, 1991, that is a permanent implant the failure of which may cause serious adverse health consequences or death, is intended for use in supporting or sustaining human life, or potentially presents a serious risk to human health. 
In other words, if you have something which can prevent death or serious injury, you certainly want to try it and use it, but you want to keep track of it to make sure if it proves to be the reverse in certain situations, that you at least know that and then can take appropriate action. 
In addition to this mandatory surveillance, FDA was authorized to require postmarket surveillance for any device when the agency determined that surveillance is necessary to protect the public health or to provide safety or effectiveness data. All manufacturers subject to mandatory postmarket surveillance were required to submit protocols for FDA approval within 30 days of first marketing the device. The FDA was required to determine the adequacy of the principal investigator and the protocol and to approve the protocol after review by an appropriately qualified advisory committee. 
In practice, the provision for mandatory surveillance, like the one for mandatory tracking, is so broadly worded that it is causing a good deal of uncertainty about those devices which are subject to this requirement. In some cases, companies and the FDA are technically exposed to unfair liability when the FDA does not require surveillance for products where it is, in fact, not necessary. We simply give FDA the discretion to require postmarket surveillance on any product it deems appropriate. This provision in no way suggests that FDA should cease to require surveillance for the types of devices it is currently covering under the existing authority. Indeed, we expect that FDA will by and large continue to require surveillance for most if not all of the products currently covered in the mandatory category. The committee and FDA believe this will be an appropriate way to bring clarity and efficiency to this important agency function. Indeed, FDA Director of Surveillance, Larry Kessler, recently said that he hoped Congress would join FDA in moving toward doing more discretionary and less required postmarket surveillance. 
They want to ensure that they can use their time as is most appropriate and most effective and efficient for their work, and not be required to do things which their judgment has found not necessary to take their time. 
So, for that reason I must oppose this, and as I pointed out, Senator Kennedy, as well as the FDA, would concur in opposition to this amendment. 
I think now I will take some of the time to go back and discuss the 404 situation here, why we are here. Senator Kennedy has taken extensive time last night and today. Certainly this is an important issue. It is an extremely important issue.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with the medical device amendments of 1976, Congress intended that device classification and approval decisions be made based on the intended use of devices as described in labeling. In the 20th century, major strides in medical technology have revolutionized the practice of medicine. Thanks to achievements in such fields as fiber optics, imaging, biomaterials, electronics, and biotechnology, today's medical technology is faster, more efficient and more productive than ever. These achievements have provided benefits to individual patients and to society at large--benefits such as better health, more cost-effective medical treatments and the return of patients to productive lives more quickly. Today more than ever, medical technology is advancing at an astounding rate. Around the world, medical providers and device innovators are working together to bring better, more cost effective therapies to patients. 
That is what we are involved with here. So we want to keep in mind, and this is why we sometimes have an interesting dilemma, where you have something which the patients' groups are plotting and which the consumer groups sometimes take an opposite position on, based upon their fears that this process may lead to something getting on the market which might cause a problem and they do not have the confidence that is built into the oversight part. I urge people to understand, the devices we are talking about are important to health. If we delay, as has been the case here, delay after delay after delay, unnecessarily so, then those who need it, those who are trying to improve their health, are denied it because some are so concerned that the delays which are deemed, really, unnecessary, lead to people having devices denied them. 
Over the years, FDA has made premarket regulatory decisions based on uses for devices that are unrelated to the intended uses set forth in labeling. S. 830 includes two provisions that express the committee's specific intention to limit FDA's review of premarket submissions to the proposed labeling before the agency. Considerations like cost-effectiveness, relative effectiveness, or whether the product effects some improvement in a patient's quality of life, are irrelevant to a premarket review unless such claims are included in proposed labeling. Simply put, the FDA should not exceed its jurisdictional responsibilities by incorporating into the review process claims not before the agency for review consideration. 
For premarket notification submissions, the labeling proposed in the submission will be controlling of a device's intended use. If the intended use is the same or sufficiently similar to the intended use of a predicate device, then the device may be found to be substantially equivalent to the predicate. No considerations outside of the proposed labeling for the 510(k) device should bear on the question of whether or not the proposed labeling of the newer device is compatible with the labeling of the predicate device. 
For premarket approval applications, the determination of whether or not there is a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness must be based on claims in proposed labeling if such labeling is neither false nor misleading. The FDA may fairly consider all facts which are pertinent to proposed labeling in PMA's in determining whether or not the labeling is false or misleading. Facts which are pertinent to proposed labeling are those which directly relate to claims in such labeling. For example, proposed labeling which states that a device is for use in treating atherosclerosis cannot be false or misleading because another device is more effective for that purpose. Nor can the proposed labeling be false or misleading because another device provides the same treatment benefits but is less expensive to purchase and operate. However, the failure to state a material fact about the device itself will make labeling in a pending PMA false or misleading. 
This provision, which has strong bipartisan support, provides a much needed element of due process to product reviews. We preserve all of FDA's enforcement authority and leave the agency wide discretion in making judgments about new products. 
What is at stake here? The ability of FDA to hold up a manufacturer's product on the basis of how a product might be used in the future--even if the company does not seek authority to market a product for those future uses. 
I think it will be helpful to delve a little deeper into the technical issues related to this amendment dealing with one part of section 404--it is worth a brief explanation of how FDA clears for marketing new products which are similar to older, legally marketed products, this is the 510(k) process. The agency considers whether the new product is substantially equivalent to the older one. In this process, FDA asks two questions. First, does the new product have the same intended use as the older product? Second, are there issues raised by technological differences in the new product compared to the older one? 
On the first question, FDA must not be allowed to second guess or impute new intended uses that the manufacturer does not claim--essentially acting as judge and jury on that question. That is what our bill does. This is simply too subjective a question to allow FDA broad latitude. This bill would not allow that. If the product before FDA claims a legitimate intended use and the product can perform that intended use, this part of the test is met. 
But what if the new product has technological features not present in the older product which give rise to different safety and efficacy concerns? Under the bill, and it would certainly be my intent, FDA should and can demand data on those concerns or else not clear the product for marketing. That is what they do today, and that is what they would do under the bill. Further, if FDA determines that a manufacturer is promoting a product for a use that is not approved, all of its enforcement authority is available to correct that situation. 
Section 404 simply establishes a proper balance in the product review process and focuses FDA's authority on the more objective ground of technological considerations.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I am sorry to have to report, we have been trying in this last 45 minutes to see if we could move some amendments that everybody has agreed to and to show that we are really trying to bring this bill before this body and to make progress so we can decrease the amount of time that will be needed at the end as we move through the cloture process. 
Unfortunately, we have not been able to get that agreement. So such amendments as those of Senator Murray, Senator DeWine, and others, that would have been approved by unanimous consent by will have to wait for some future time in hopes that we can get agreement. 
I want to point out there are a large number of amendments pending on this bill, many of which are agreed to, others that probably will fall by the wayside, it should not be that difficult to finish work on this bill. However, if we continue to have this delay, without any cooperation to move the process forward, then it is going to foul up our very crowded calendar. That is unfortunate, as we all want to get the legislation done, get the conference reports on appropriations bills passed, and other pending legislation which is essential, so that we do not have to shut the Government down. If we fail to get the cooperation of the minority in even agreeing to things that everybody agrees to, it is unfortunate. 
Let me point out some of the Senators we would have helped today: Senator DeWine, for instance, and Senator Dodd; their amendments should have been agreed to. They have shown great leadership in advocating greater research into pediatric uses of new and existing drugs. Their amendment reflects Senator DeWine's successful effort to marry the mandated approach in the administration's regulations with the incentive-based approach underlying Senator DeWine and Senator Dodd's provision. Senator Murray has worked diligently to protect the health and safety of children. Her amendment, which everybody agrees should be approved, modifies the national uniformity provision clarifying that the exemption requirement is applicable to the health and safety of children. 
Other amendments by other Members that we could have adopted today will have to be done at some later time as long as the minority continues to block progress on the 152-page bill, of which 150 pages are agreed to. That does not make much sense. Why do we have this delay over a provision on which there is a disagreement, and general knowledge that the disagreement will have to be taken care of in the conference committee. The White House will insist that we come up with something different than is in the bill and the House has already taken a different position. Why should we delay the meeting of that conference committee? 
I urge the minority to let us vote--they are holding up an extremely important piece of legislation. The only advantage in doing this is to raise more public attention to one issue--that the minority is willing to tie up the Senate over one sentence in this bill in full knowledge that further work will be done on the issue in conference. 
So let's move this bill along, get it to conference. The House is moving expeditiously, so we can go to conference probably at the end of next week if we can get this bill done. I urge the minority to change the tactics of delaying any progress on this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I could not help but come in and join you, associate myself with your remarks for Bob, because I worked with him both in the House and the Senate. I agree with everything you said. He did so much to assist all of us who wanted to benefit those in the most needy situations. I agree with you. If it wasn't for him--and also of course Patricia Morrissey on my side, those two who worked so very closely together all during that period of time--we would not have accomplished so much. Bobby was incredible. I know he is going to have even, perhaps, a more useful role now that the basic work is done in the profession he is going into. But he is one wonderful person. 
You are to be commended for recognizing that and utilizing him, of course, to benefit all of us. I thank the Senator for his comments.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, while we are waiting for a final draft of the amendment I intend to offer, I thought in the meantime I might just as well talk about it, and then we can take care of it when it is ready. 
Senator Torricelli and I had a very interesting time earlier this week in helping celebrate the aftermath of the reenactment of the Battle of Antietam which occurred this past weekend, which reenacted one of the most, if not the most, violent battles in the history of warfare in the Civil War. 
It was a remarkable experience, because not only were there thousands of people participating in the reenactment, but there also were over 100,000 people who watched the reenactment of that incredible battle which was, they say, the most bloody of the Civil War. 
It reminded me of this Nation, as we march on toward the end of this millennium, that we do have an obligation to make a commitment to ourselves in this interim before we go to the next millennium to ensure that we have learned the lessons of history, especially in this Nation, now the most proud and important and strongest Nation in the world, of how we formed and how we lived our lives up through the time it was created in respect to its modern form of people arriving from Europe and other places, and the struggles that we had which were not easy ones. 
We are still, in a sense, living some of the aftermath with respect to some of the biases and problems of discrimination in this Nation against those in the black community, who, as we all know, came over here as slaves, and then the great Civil War between the North and the South fought, to some extent, based upon the principles of the States rights, and yet also the very, very difficult question of abolishment of slavery in this country. 
I have had the opportunity over the course of time to study a great deal about that war, for Vermont was very dedicated and, in many ways, was the leader in the sense of commitment, for it was early on that Vermonters participated in a higher number per capita than any State in the North. In battle after battle, Vermonters were at the head of the troops. In fact, Lincoln at one time commented after reviewing the efforts of Vermonters, `Just tell them to follow the Vermonters.' 
When I was first in the Senate, our Vermont Legislature, in commemoration of the 100th year of the Battle of Cedar Creek--I guess it was a little longer than that, 120th, or something like that, because that was 1864, so I wasn't quite here yet, obviously. But anyway, they, in a sense, passed a resolution telling the Vermont delegation that they should go to the Battle of Cedar Creek and locate a monument which was erected there many, many years ago which commemorated the Vermonters. I will mention a little bit about that in a moment. 
We went there and had to locate it. It was at the back of a private house, and we found that it was all grown up and trees were winding in and out of the fencework around it. So we took immediate steps to get permission from the landowner and then transferred that information back to our legislature. 
But it brought to mind that before the memorabilia and memorials all disappeared, it would be important for us to try and see what we could do to retain them and make them available for future generations. 
So I introduced a bill to commemorate, in a sense, the battle in 1864 which led to the election of Lincoln, but also I became so entranced with Stonewall Jackson that I began to study the Stonewall Jackson campaign which occurred earlier in 1862 and recognized and realized from reading that it was the Jackson campaign in the Shenandoah Valley that led to a whole new concept of how to conduct war. 
In those battles, Stonewall Jackson took advantage of modern movement by the railroads. So he would appear in one place in Virginia, lodge a battle and then hop on a train and move to a totally different area, and in wonderment, he would appear miles and miles away and have another battle. 
So I came to the conclusion that it would make it very interesting if we could save those battlefields and to create a sort of historic trail with the Park Service so that people could, in a few days, start and follow the Stonewall Jackson campaign and move up through the Shenandoah Valley and then turn around and come back. 
That idea grew. Then attached to that at that time came the thought that we ought to take a look at conserving all battlefields that had a meaningful part of our history. Thus, the Battlefield Commission was created and the coin and all to try and fund it. That happened. 
Now we are coming, as I started to say, to the end of our century, the end of the millennium, and still much needs to be done to be able to make sure that the history and the battlefields which were the main battles of the Civil War are not lost for future generations. 
We have found that many of them are up for sale or the lands around them or critical pieces of land that were involved with those battlefields are up for sale. 
Thus, shortly we will be introducing an amendment to make sure that we do not lose the opportunity to provide the funding and the direction to the appropriate Federal officials to make sure that there are funds available to ensure that we can maintain the integrity of the main battlefields of the Civil War. 
I know my friend from New Jersey, who was with me as we thought about this and met with people this past week, joins me in this. I now yield the floor and allow him to participate in this discussion as we await the final draft.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my amendment is a critically important amendment to make sure that we preserve the Civil War battlefields for those people who will be in the next millennium to better understand this Nation. 
Mr. President, I am proud to be joined today by Senator Torricelli in offering this amendment of national historic significance. 
The American Civil War is thought by many historians to be the fundamental event shaping the character of the United States. This amendment takes a giant stride at preserving our history by establishing that it is these funds that be made available to protect the threatened American Civil War battlefields. 
I am proud to say that there is in this land a great wellspring of caring for the places where freedom was won and defended. Millions of Americans have, in recent years, become aware of the hallowed ground of our Civil War battlefields, have visited them, read of them, many have written of them. 
The clear and eloquent message I hear is that these treasured places should be saved, intact, for future generations. The preservation message goes forth from Gettysburg, Antietam, Manassas, Cold Harbor, Malvern Hill, Cedar Creek, Petersburg, Stones River, and dozens more Civil War places. 
When battlefields become severely threatened there quickly develops a continuity of Americans that spreads nationwide. The American people care about their history, look on these places as national treasures, and speak eloquently and effectively for their preservation. 
Preserving our Nation's battlefields is a subject very close to my heart. My efforts to preserve our Nation's historic places actually began in my State of Vermont several years ago when the Vermont Legislature unanimously passed a resolution asking Congress to save the places where Vermonters fought in the Civil War. The resolution was presented to me, and I went to work finding out all I could about the battlefields and what was needed. It quickly became apparent that the Civil War battlefields were in need of protection. 
Over 7 years ago, Congress responded to the growing awareness of our Civil War heritage and the concern for the sites where that heritage took form, by passing legislation that created a national Civil War Sites Advisory Commission. Composed of distinguished historians, supported by a staff of National Park Service experts, the commission for 2 years studied the remaining Civil War battlefields. Civil War sites were visited, public meetings held, and in the end a report was written. The report presented a plan of action for protecting what remain of the Civil War battlefields. It is a plan that has recognized the need to act, a plan that I strongly favor. 
Mr. President, as a proud American, preserving our great history is an opportunity I am always ready to seize. Congress should do what we can to help meet the recommendations of the Civil War Advisory Commission by preserving the country's most endangered Civil War sites. 
In fighting to preserve Civil War battle sites, we have aimed to create the chance for our citizens to travel from battlefield to battlefield and to relive the brilliant Jackson campaign of 1862, and the successful Union campaign of 1864. By preserving these sites, we will allow people to enjoy the beautiful surroundings such as the Shenandoah Valley and give area economies an important boost. 
Several years ago, I had the privilege to travel from battlefield to battlefield with several Civil War historians and Civil War buffs. We saw those battlefields pretty much as they were during the Civil War. We relived Jackson's battles of the 1862 campaign, one of the most studied campaigns in history. We also retraced the Union campaign of 1864. At that time the election was not looking so good for President Lincoln, and the Union was in dire need of battle victories. General Sheridan marched the Union forces up to the valley and won a series of battles culminating in the Battle of Ceder Creek. Many historians believe that this was the turning point in the war. 
Mr. President, I came away from this trip with the strong feeling that it is my responsibility as U.S. Senator to help preserve this part of our national heritage. Bruce Catton, one of our Nation's most eminent historians has written:  
Any historian who confronts a gap in the record of bygone days knows moments of despair when he complains bitterly that no one took the trouble to dig out and assemble all of the facts while those facts where still available. To use unlimited resources in as broad and as all-inclusive as it possibly can be, to do it while everything is still fresh, and to do it with no other earthly motive than a desire to establish the full truth--this is the sort of thing that only governments can do, and they almost never dream of doing it. 
Mr. Catton's words are more important than just an expression of the historian's frustration at not having access to `all the facts.' His words constitute a challenge, a challenge to government to preserve and protect the fragile bits and pieces of our Nation's history that remain with us today, but which tomorrow could vanish forever. 
Just this past weekend, the Battle of Antietam or Sharpsburg, as it was referred to by the Confederates, was relived as over 15,000 civil war enthusiasts reenacted this bloody battle before over 100,000 spectators. On this day, 135 years ago, over 23,000 brave Americans lost their lives at the Battle of Antietam. The number of casualties was three times greater than the number of Americans killed at Normandy on D-day. Left for the dead on the battlefield, but surviving, was a young captain from Massachusetts who became one of the nation's most respected Supreme Court Justices, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. General McClellan sent a message to Washington of a great victory, however the Confederates escaped across the Potomac and retreated into the lower Shanandoah Valley with little interference. Many believe that the victory prompted Abraham Lincoln to unveil his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862. 
Mr. President, if we persist, we could give to future generations of Americans a gift of history, the opportunity to see, to walk, the hallowed ground of one of the most beautiful places on earth where this Nation's history was written. If we fail, we must answer to future generations who go in vain to seek places of our heritage. On October 19, 1864, with victory in his grasp, Jubal Early declined to launch a last attack. Early believed his valiant Confederate troops had won an adequate victory for the day along the banks of Cedar Creek. `But this is the Sixth Corps,' an aide protested, `and they will not go unless we drive them.' Early did not attack and his day was soon lost. 
To those who would act too cautiously here, I say, `But this is the eleventh hour. The battlefields will be lost unless we act now and decisively.'

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I think I would like to talk a little bit about where we are right now in the process. 
We had an agreement this last weekend which would have allowed us to dispose of this bill without the necessity of going through the cloture process. But then fen/phen happened. All of a sudden the Nation is alarmed and concerned, and reasonably so. But to bring the pharmaceutical fen/phen issue into the device issue is disingenuous. The situation with fen/phen is that two different, approved drugs were used in combination on the basis that doctors found out that when used in combination they were more effective in achieving their purpose of reducing weight. It was determined by some astute doctors who noted that there were some problems being caused with respect to heart valves that there was a relationship between those problems and the drug combination. This was brought by the doctors to the attention of FDA, and the FDA immediately alerted the marketplace and called for a prompt in-depth evaluation. On the basis of further data the companies voluntarily removed them from the market. 
Now we are talking about a very, very different issue when it comes to the device issue discussed by the Senator. For instance, let's go back to fen/phen. If a drug company had to test its drug in combination with every other drug that is on the market with which it might reasonably be expected to be used in combination, it would take decades before anything would be approved. Right now I have had a whiplash. I am taking two different drugs to manage the injury. But I don't think anybody has done a study to figure out whether Ibuprofen and the other drug I am taking is going to create some problem for me. I hope they don't spend all of that time researching that question because we would never get anything approved. That is certainly the case with the devices, we must not allow the FDA to endlessly question device manufacturers about how physicians might or might not use their product in the future, especially if the manufacturer does not seek permission to market or promote for that use. 
Again, we had an agreement going into this week that we would argue this device thing out, and then we would vote on it. Now that is off because of fen/phen. So we are now in the a post-fen/phen situation. 
But let us remember that we just had a vote. It was 94 to 4 that we ought to go forward. Why? Last week we were delaying consideration over 6 pages of a 152-page bill, we are now talking about 2 pages of a 152-page bill. I agree that section 404 is an important issue. We need section 404 to correct problems at FDA. 
Also, I am concerned that my good friend from Massachusetts is getting into an emotional argument about the security of people in this Nation, and that somehow we are threatening their security by this particular provision--I have been chastised in my own State, and perhaps the country, saying I am threatening the lives of all Americans with this bill. That is life in politics. You have to take that. 
Let me talk about the issue that we have with respect to the devices. 
While the past has been marked by advances for both patients and the economy, the present is increasingly troublesome, and the future is by no means assured. For both premarket-approved products and the 510(k) product--that is, nearly identical products--the FDA's review requirements have become more burdensome and are taking more time. This has resulted in the delay of approving new devices. That is the issue here. Should we have to wait years to get something which will help us, help our health, help save our life, because FDA wants to explore hypothetical uses of the product by physicians, acting on their own initiative? 
This has resulted in the delay of approving new devices. Furthermore, the current regulatory system is not keeping pace with medical innovation. U.S. patients face delayed access to the newer, more advanced generations of devices. In some cases, Americans are going abroad to take advantage of these technologies. U.S. device firms are themselves moving production and research facilities to other countries. 
A study conducted by Medical Technology Consultants, MTCE Ltd., found that patients in the United States wait up to three times as long as their European counterparts for Government approval of new medical devices. The study also found that higher risk, breakthrough medical devices were approved in Europe within 80 to 120 days, provided the manufacturer has passed an EU facility inspection, which is completed within 120 days. Similar devices take an average of 773 days to be approved in the United States. New lower risk devices entered the European market with no delay once a manufacturer has passed the initial facility inspection. Similar devices take an average of 178 days to be approved in the United States. 
The FDA already takes four times as long to approve breakthrough medical devices as is allowed by U.S. statute--it has to do them faster--according to the Health Industry Manufacturers Association, HIMA. The approval times for these devices have nearly doubled since 1990. The FDA's record on approving incremental improvements to existing devices is similar, with approval times also nearly doubling since 1990. Manufacturers will not continue to research and develop devices in the United States--they will all be overseas--if they face such egragious delays. Patients presently have to wait for devices stuck in the FDA's pipeline, and manufacturers have little incentive to bring new devices into that pipeline in the first place. 
According to another study conducted by the Wilkerson Group, a New York-based independent consulting firm, FDA delays in approving devices will lead to the loss of U.S. jobs to nations where approval processes are more streamlined--an estimated 50,000 jobs over the next 5 years. Governments in Ireland, the Netherlands and elsewhere have already begun to highlight the impediment of FDA regulatory delay in their marketing materials to attract United States businesses overseas. Such actions will erode our Nation's medical research infrastructure over time. 
So we are going to be getting them all from Europe. That is not going to help us obtain better health care for our citizens. 
I would say one of the problems we have had, and the reason we have PDUFA and everything else, is to try to help the FDA be more efficient and effective in getting through their duties. It is important that we become more effective and efficient in reviewing these devices. I point out we here in this country have a wonderful record, but it can be a better record. 
Certainly another thing I would like to point out--why are the patients' representatives in favor of amendments that we have and consumers opposing them at times? Because consumers, obviously, are looking at it from a different perspective. They are not ill. They don't need it. So they say, `Don't do anything that might hurt us. It is better to be safe and take a long time and delay it, than it is to put it on the market.' That's fine. But if you are a patient, you say, `Hey, wait a minute. I am willing to take a little risk. I am willing to take a little risk. I'm in bad shape.' So you have to keep those things in mind when you listen to the arguments. In most all the cases, the patients certainly are on one side, in a sense, and the consumer is on the other. 
With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, we are here to discuss yet again the need for cloture on S. 830, the FDA Modernization and Accounting Act. We have already had 14 hours of floor debate on this measure and we have not yet discussed this amendment. This will be the second time that cloture has been voted on regarding this measure. The first vote was 89 to 5 to invoke cloture. The Senate has spoken. And, yet, we are here to repeat ourselves again and again. 
My colleagues have already heard repeatedly from both sides of the aisle about the strong bipartisan commitment to crafting this measure, about the months of negotiations, deliberation and collaboration with the administration, the minority, and outside groups. Literally dozens of accommodations have been made and agreements reached. No one disputes that this is a good bill. No one should dispute that we have moved forward, or that we should move forward, with our debate on the remaining issues. Now we 
should move forward on that debate. 
This measure accomplishes two very important objectives. First, it modernizes the way that the Food and Drug Administration accomplishes its mission. It streamlines the review and approval process for medical devices, pharmaceutical, and biological products. In so doing, it helps to ensure that the best and safest medical technology available in the world would be available to the American people. In so doing, it helps ensure that the best medical technology jobs will continue to be available for the American people. 
Second, this measure authorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act--or PDUFA, as it is known. Everyone agrees that PDUFA has been immensely successful in helping FDA do its job better and more efficiently. 
Mr. President, congressional authorization for PDUFA expires in 15 days. At the end of September this successful and innovative program will be at serious risk. It is the height of irony that a program like PDUFA that was designed to reduce delay at the FDA is now at risk of becoming bogged-down in a procedural delay on the Senate floor. 
I would argue that the time for delay is over, and that the time for the Senate to do its work it was sent here to do is now. 
Almost 50 amendments have been filed on this measure. And, frankly, virtually all of them are nongermane, or they have been worked out, or they can be worked out. A single provision remains that may require some extended debate, and we should move to its consideration and an up-or-down vote on it as soon as possible. 
Last week we spent almost 15 hours talking about uniformity for cosmetics. We have an agreement on that provision, thanks to the efforts of Senator Gregg. 
I say that we should move on. I say we complete this debate, and finish this measure, and let's vote. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. To inflame this issue into being one of false information and filing of misleading information is totally incorrect. The issue here is not that. The issue here, on each of these medical devices, is whether or not they must file every conceivable, possible use that FDA thinks might be made of it. FDA 
should focus rather on the use that it is intended for or any other use that the manufacturers know it will be intended for. There is nothing involving false or misleading information. That, of course, is under the control of the FDA and that would be a serious matter with the FDA. It could, and should deny approval of a device where a manufacturer deliberately files false and misleading information. 
Let us set the record straight. Manufacturers cannot file false and misleading language. To raise that as the issue is to really differ from what the important issue is, and that is how long do Americans have to wait to get access to important, new medical devices. In Europe it takes much less time and it is much more expeditiously handled. We can have the same kind of treatment here while ensuring that they are safe and effective for their intended use. For any device that is intended for a particular use and it is known by doctors to be effective for another use, that's fine. That is the practice of medicine. Doctors sometimes find other, valuable uses for medical devices. That is how medical practice and innovation proceeds--and we don't want the Federal Government telling doctors how to practice medicine. 
But for the manufacturer to search out every conceivable use and then to study every conceivable possible use ends up in delays of these devices coming onto the market. That means that Americans, doctors and patients, are unable to utilize medical innovations that are more readily available in Europe. So I wish we would get away from making this into a `false and misleading language' filing. There is no such issue here as that. The question is how much right does the FDA have to require a manufacturer to understand and get involved with the practice of medicine where some other use might be made. That is the issue. 
I think there are ways we can solve this, but not just by raising it to the issue of emotionalism. That is not the solution here. There is no problem having false or misleading information filed on a medical device approval application, because that is against the law. I yield the floor.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill Center, VT on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. It is the oldest maple research facility in the country with a mission that embraces research, demonstration, and education. 
The center employs basic, as well as, applied research in studying various aspects of the sugar maple tree, its products and methods to improve syrup production. In addition, the facility monitors long-term meteorogical as well as air pollution data in close cooperation with a number of State and Federal agencies. Operations on site demonstrate the latest technologies from which the public and industry can learn the best methods available for manufacturing. The center's state-of-the-art laboratory promotes crucial communication among researchers. 
Over the years, research conducted at the center has provided new techniques for efficient sap collection and evaporation systems. It has, and will continue to play an integral role in the success of our region's maple sugar industry so very critical to the local economy. 
I am sure that the impact of work completed at the center is realized not only in New England, but across the country, as many have had the pleasure of tasting the fruits of their labor. As a Vermonter and one of millions of Americans that enjoys maple sugar products each year, I would like to extend my best wishes to the Proctor Maple Research Center for many more years of continued success.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I spoke at length yesterday. I will try not to beat that record, but I do want to make a few comments. 
First of all, if you take $100 million and divide it by 250 million, you come up with about 38 cents a person and that represents what the endowment costs. I think we have to put in focus what we spend on the arts and why we spend it there. 
We had some excellent presentations yesterday and we had some this morning on different views of how the money for the Endowment ought to be spent. I guess if you analyzed the Senate, we would have probably 70 or 80 people who say, `OK, let's spend the money, but we have a different way to spend it.' 
A number would spend it with more going to the States. Some would spend it with all going to the States. Others would spend it in different proportions. But I guess that if it was just a question of whether there ought to be that much money out there available, that we would have a big vote, 70, 80 votes in the Senate, and that is what we need to do--analyze and figure out whether the way we are spending it is the best way. 
That, I think, is what is being asked of this body, and I think is being asked of the people throughout the country: Are we spending too much on administration? Are we directing too much of the money to the big cities? Are we spending too much in other areas rather than out in the States? So I hope we keep that in mind as we go forward and examine the amendments that we will be faced with. 
I would also like to point out some of the very excellent points that were made by other Senators yesterday. I think Senator Bennett from Utah probably made one of the best presentations I have heard on why the Endowments are so important and what it does mean to have your particular program get the stamp of approval. As he stated, it is like the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for a program. What this does is allow you to not only utilize the money, the small amount of money you get from the Endowment, but to use that as a fundraiser to be able to let people know, `Hey, this is a good program and it has the sanction of the Endowment and, therefore, you should help us put that program on.' It was an excellent presentation. 
We have had others this morning, Senator Tim Hutchinson and others, as well as Senator Hutchison of Texas saying, well, yes, it is a good program, but more of it ought to be distributed to States and a lot less of it ought to be spent from Washington. 
I spent my time yesterday stating that I might have an amendment which would spend more of the money in the area of education, indicating that the studies demonstrate that those people who participate in programs of art and music do substantially better on SATs than those who do not. I think that is something we should take note of. And there are a lot of reasons for that. 
Some of the basic problems we have in education is the lack of discipline and respect by students. Both of these qualities come along with the arts and the programs with the arts--I delineated a number of those programs that I have viewed as I traveled around the country where students have done exceptionally well, from the east coast to the west coast. When the authorization bill came out of the committee, we suggested that NEA ought to look at trying to evaluate and assist the rest of the country, understand which programs do work, what programs are helpful in improving the access to the arts in education. 
Also, as I pointed out yesterday, there are many programs which have been successful in the cities around the country in helping those who are impoverished. I mentioned one program in New York City where there was a horrible situation--so many young people had come from homes of violence, where a member of a family had been killed. Through art and art therapy they were able to bring out the horrible experiences in that child's life and begin to open up a vista of perhaps a life without violence and fear introducing instead hope and other positive things like that. 
I think there is a general consensus--or close, a substantial number of Members of this body--that we ought to keep the Endowment but perhaps take a look at how those funds are utilized. So I expect that the Senator from Alaska will have an amendment along those lines. 
Also, I would like to just raise a few things. I did not talk about the importance of the Endowment in extending the benefits of the arts and the benefits of museums around the country. 
For instance, the Portland Arts Museum moves out to support the Northwest Film Festival, showcasing the works of artists from Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Washington; the Paul Taylor Dance in New York received a grant to tour through Alaska, Texas, and 
California; the NEA-supported Educational Broadcasting Corporation in New York to put `Great Performances' and `American Masters' on TV for the enjoyment of millions. The New England Foundation for the Arts received a grant to bring the `Dance on Tour' program to Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Massachusetts. The YMCA in Chicago received a grant to expand its Writers Voice centers--writing workshops for young people--to Georgia, New Hampshire, Florida, and Rhode Island. 
States have little incentive to fund projects which benefit people outside its borders, yet it is those partnerships which enrich our Nation. These are examples of why national leadership is important. So I hope that as we move forward we remind ourselves that there are many activities of the Endowment other than some of the areas of controversy that we have heard of. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes. If the Senator will yield, my understanding was when we went home this weekend that we would be ready to close the bill and have all amendments with time agreements. Now my understanding from the minority is that they are not in agreement on one particular provision of the substitute. Thus, I would believe we should go forward with the cloture vote. We are ready, though, with a number of amendments for which I believe we have agreements. We could address those in the interim while we try to work out the final amendment.

Mr. JEFFORDS. First of all, Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New York, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, for his excellent presentation on the history of the Endowment. I think it is important that we dwell on that a while, or just a few minutes here anyway, because we have heard some rather severe condemnations of a program of which, in the final analysis, after review, would show has been very helpful in enhancing the availability of the arts in this Nation. I find it problematic that even though we seem to have eliminated all of the policies that have caused problems as part of the 1996 appropriations act, to some, they still seem to exist. Let me talk a little bit about that, after again, thanking the Senator most sincerely for that historical presentation, which was most helpful. 
Back in 1996, when we passed the appropriations legislation, we placed prohibitions on policies that have caused difficulty with the Senator of North Carolina and others, on the utilization of funds from the Endowment. First, we placed a prohibition on subgranting. Now, subgranting was a practice in which the Endowment itself would give a grant to an institution and that institution would in turn make grants for other things or to individual performances. An example of such a practice was raised with regard to a program mentioned by the Senator from North Carolina with respect to the Whitney Museum. It is illustrative because it points out how far we would have to go in order to satisfy those who are concerned about painting the Endowment out to be making inappropriate grants--some time, some place, somewhere, some performance will be what someone might call pornographic. Most often, it is that subgrant or another activity, separately funded, which was not issued by the Endowment, like the example of a performance at the Whitney Museum. The Whitney Museum did get a grant for its building, but not for the performance that the Senator from North Carolina mentioned. Now, the Senator from North Carolina would say that because a performance was done in that building, which had received a grant for its construction, it should have been prevented because it, in his determination, would have been offensive. That is an unrealistic standard and I would hate to think that of the programs that we fund in the United States, that we would go to the extent of censoring what people there participated in or what happens in our places of enjoyment, museums, or any place else. 
Another thing we did to prevent some of the types of programming which had become offensive was to prevent seasonal support. Institutions must now specify what specific projects they will support with the funds they receive from the Endowment. And also, even more important from the perspective of trying to prevent the kinds of performances which the Senator from North Carolina was pointing out, was to prevent grants to individuals. 
In the House when the issue of some of these grants was raised, Jane Alexander, the Chairman of the NEA--and I will make this a part of the Record--pointed out in the House definitively that they were not grants made by the NEA. Still, those are the ones that are used to condemn the NEA.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to point out that we should not get off track of what the Senator from New York has attempted to do, and that is to remember why the Endowment was created and what is the importance of the arts, what is the importance of the Federal support for the arts. 
We have a huge Nation, a wonderful Nation, and a nation with diverse cultures with wonderful things occurring from one coast to the other, from the North to the South. The arts help us understand life and the NEA help the Nation learn about the good things that are going on in the arts across the country--the good things that will help us understand where we are going, what our society is about, and what we need to do to be happy, to have a good life, and to be able to solve our problems. 
The purpose of the Endowment is to allow those areas--those things that are successful, those things that appeal to us, that make our culture rich--our art--to be shared from State to State. The Federal role encourages this exchange and supports all States by collecting, disseminating, and allowing programs to tour all around the country, making sure that programs which are important and essential to education or to assist those in depressed areas that are impoverished are shared. 
So I will be offering an amendment which will say that at this time in our Nation we recognize that we have two very serious problems, and they are very closely related: 
Education. We know that we must improve education in our Nation. It is essential that we do that. It is essential because in this day and age competition from international economies has created real problems for us, with jobs in the thousands leaving this country and going to others, threatening our Nation's ability to compete right now. For instance, we have 190,000 jobs in the technology area that are going unfilled because we do not have the young people or older people with the skills necessary to perform those jobs. We had one CEO who testified before the Labor Committee who said that he had seriously considered, like others are moving centers of their manufacturing from this Nation to other nations because people there have the skills, they are ready, they are available, and the cost is cheaper. 
So one of the purposes and an important function of the Endowment is to try to see how we can help solve that problem of education. 
In addition to that, we also have the problem of welfare reform. Some of the greatest problems this Nation faces are in the inner cities with our poor, with violence, and with the incredible problems that people face trying to find direction and meaning in their lives. What can you do? How can you escape from the pressures that you have in the ghettos? 
I have traveled around this Nation and have observed education and welfare programs. Many of these are programs were enhanced by programs put on or financed in part by the National Endowment for the Arts. Let me give you a few of those to demonstrate what I mean. 
The thing I would like to talk about first is education; and learning. It is so much easier to understand and to learn if what you are doing is relevant, or in some way relevant, to your life, making it a little bit better, or giving you a way to make it a little bit better. 
Let me go through some of the programs that I have witnessed. These were funded by the Endowment, or assisted by the Endowment. Let me take you to the inner city of New York City in the Hispanic area where some of the highest crime rates and some of the highest poverty rates exist. 
I visited Ballet Hispanico on a weekend morning where young kids of 5, 6, 7, or 8 years old received instruction in ballet, participating with all the enthusiasm that young kids can have, knowing that when they left there they were going to have just a little bit more hope. This program provided a way that they could see a window through all of the chaos that they live in to be able 
to take them to a better life. 
A more dramatic exhibition of that, also in New York City was a program that I visited--again, a program which was supported by the Endowment--where I saw these young children all drawing kind of frantically on the papers that were in front of them. I asked, `What is going on here?' The teacher informed me that each one of those children had lost a member of their family, by violence, that they had blocked off reality, and they could not communicate about what happened to them. But by drawing and by artistic expression they could let their feelings out, they could break through, there was hope for those children that their life could break away from this poverty and violence which they were in. 
Also, one only has to go to listen to the Harlem Boys Choir or so many other demonstrations of what has gone on with the individuals who have participated in NEA funded activities. I also went out to San Diego, CA, and went to a school out there which was an incredible one, a music magnet school, but again in one of the depressed areas of San Diego. This was a middle school of seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, where they had an orchestra, a band, a jazz band. Almost everyone in that school had arrived there in the seventh grade without any skills in music. When I listened to them play, it brought tears to my eyes. To think that these young people when they came to that school did not see a purpose in life but perhaps now saw that there could be some beauty in their lives. I could go right here to Washington, DC. In Washington, DC, we have a school that is under the tutelage of the Kennedy Center. I was amazed with that one. I found they had artists there who were teaching, but they weren't teaching art. They were teaching math, and they were teaching science. How were they doing that? I went, and I watched these young kids making little pianos. They were learning how to measure them, construct them, and learning their geometry. Then they learned how the sounds came out differently from the little thing they hit it with. They could make music. They understood why the frequencies were different and why the frequencies were made different by the lengths of those strings. 
What happened to those students? The math rates went up in that school--not so much for the reading scores, but the math rate went climbing upward. 
So we know that using the arts, there are ways in which we can break through to things which are interesting and relevant--music as well as the performing arts and the graphic arts. 
So we have a way to realize improvement here. So that is why my amendment would say that what we need in this country is to identify each of these programs all throughout the country and to let other people know in other States what programs are working, what are the ones that break through to those young kids who had suffered from violence and loss in their families. Which ones broke through to help? Is there further evidence of how this could work? 
Statistics based on College Board figures, the organization that performs the SATs, show a difference between those students who participated in music and the arts as compared with students who did not. They found there was a dramatic difference. With those who had 4 or more years in music or art, verbal SAT scores went up almost 60 points and math SAT scores went up over 40 points. To a young person who is hoping to break out of poverty, to not get caught on welfare, the thought that by participating in music and art, the window of opportunity could be enlarged and the doors of college or university could be opened wide to them gives you an idea of what can happen if we structure the NEA better so that it identifies, helps fund and allows us to share throughout this broad Nation of ours those successful programs. 
I have done a rough analysis and summary of just a few of the successful kinds of programs that we have like this in this country. They are very different. Some use the arts secondarily. Some in different ways teach math or science. Roughly 1 percent of our schools are good; 1 percent are doing the job; 1 percent of our 
students are getting that kind of education that we need. Ninety-nine percent need to learn from somebody, somewhere, or somehow how they can improve their results. The way they can do it is by being able to know where those programs are, who has them, so that they can identify and look at them and replicate them. 
I think the Endowment, by helping identify, perhaps in cooperation and coordination with the States and the Department of Education, can make those programs available for others to see and to utilize. 
One of the advantages of this great Nation is that we have people who are innovative, who can design and find ways to solve these problems. The disadvantage we have over foreign nations is that of replication, getting the people who are in charge of the programs, who are trying to design these things well to become aware of successful programs that already exist. 
Let me give you an example of how we differ from other nations, and we have to analyze it as to whether we should be looking at this problem and see if we can correct it. I think we should. We have a program in the area of work force improvement called TECH PREP. It is in combination with the secondary schools and junior colleges or community colleges, and how they can work together and bring some of the courses down into the high school and to pull the students up to the level where when they graduate they will have the ability to get those jobs that I was talking about those $30-, $40-, $50-an-hour jobs paying $100,000 or $90,000 that are available in this Nation. 
Malaysia came over and took one look at our program, TECH PREP, and said this is a great idea. Look how well it is working. They went back and overnight Malaysia adopted our TECH PREP program. We are still at 1 percent. About 1 percent of the schools in this country have the TECH PREP linkage with other higher educational institutions. 
Those are just examples of why it is necessary for us to have programs and methodology to be able to share those great things which are occurring throughout the Nation so that they can be available to all. Those things will not be readily located or identified or provided unless we have some way to collect, to identify, to evaluate, and to let others know about them. I believe the Endowment could help us immeasurably in that area. 
Mr. President, I have gone on longer than I wanted to. I suppose I will be back tomorrow when we take this up. I hope that my colleagues will share some other examples of NEA-funded programs that demonstrate the advantage of a Federal system which tries to enhance the arts and our culture, enhances enrichment and educational activities as well as to show what positive results can be achieved by giving young people, at an early age, an interest in learning. The NEA has been successful in these areas. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. This amendment goes under the presumption that the Federal Government controls these programs. The fact that the author of the amendment has already taken three-quarters of the money out of his amendment and continues to give it to the States recognizes that. 
The additional funds that would go for these programs will no longer go to these programs, but will go directly to local governments--Goals 2000; school-to-work; technology; reading, school improvement programs like `Reading is Fundamental'; arts education; magnet schools; women's equity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 
Drug-free schools will just go to local governments. Indian education, bilingual education, vocational rehabilitation--50 percent going to rehab will instead go to local governments to do with as they want. Vocational education, they will do the same. Yes, it goes to education, but there is no maintenance of effort here, therefore, the local governments may well decide to replace their present educational money.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
First, filing a cloture motion sort of indicates a serious situation which requires its action. I am pleased to report that I am more optimistic now than I have been at any time that a vote will not be necessary to have cloture and that we are all working very long and hard upon resolving the remaining questions. The most difficult one that we were facing appears to be resolved. So it is my firm belief that by the time we come before this body again, other than today's debate, we will have an opportunity to expeditiously pass an FDA bill for the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that we have it passed in time to prevent the problems which might occur by failing to do so. 
Legislation to reform and modernize the Food and Drug Administration has been under consideration by Congress for over 3 years. At least six hearings have been held over the past 2 years in the Senate. 
Last year, our measure was reported out of committee but never reached the floor for full consideration. This year, we have held hearings and worked through months of negotiations with my colleague from Massachusetts and with the administration.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this legislation is the result of a well-considered process to consult with all points of view and to benefit from the expertise needed to craft legislation on this complex matter. The substitute before us today stands on the shoulders of four hearings and a committee markup of a comprehensive Food and Drug Administration reform bill in the 104th Congress. 
This year we held two more hearings, taking testimony from Food and Drug Administration, industry experts, physicians, and consumer groups--and I emphasize `and consumer groups.' Staff held dozens of meetings with Food and Drug Administration, experts and patient groups, discussing in detail every issue of this bill. The negotiation process with Food and Drug Administration, and the minority started in the drafting phase of the bill and continued up to and right through the markup, and has continued right up to this moment. This has been a process marked by openness and consultation. 
The philosophy of this bill is to codify recent efforts of the self-reform of the Food and Drug Administration, and a great deal of that is self-reform which we are codifying, and to provide the Food and Drug Administration with the tools to do even better in certain areas. 
We recognize that Congress cannot micromanage an agency like the Food and Drug Administration, nor do we want to. But we must set realistic performance goals to ensure the public is protected and well served and that the industry is fairly treated. In an era of flat or declining resources, we must give the Food and Drug Administration the management tools it needs to manage an increasing workload without the expectation of ever-increasing appropriations to assist them. 
The first title of S. 830 establishes in statute that the mission of the Food and Drug Administration is to protect the public health, promptly and efficiently review clinical research, and take appropriate action on the marketing of regulated products in a manner that does not unduly impede innovation or product availability. 
From the 1906 Food and Drugs Act through the 1990 Safe Medical Devices Act, food and drug law has emphasized the duty of the Food and Drug Administration is to protect the public against unsafe or ineffective products. This legislation, as reflected in the mission statement, strengthens protection of the public from unsafe or ineffective products and provides a better balance in the law by ensuring timely access to safe and effective products. It is simple: Safe and effective products can be made available more quickly--and they should be. That is what this bill does. 
The legislation reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, commonly referred to as PDUFA, to allow the continued collection of user fees from prescription drug manufacturers for 5 additional years. PDUFA I represented a consensus among the Food and Drug Administration, the prescription drug industry, and Congress that the industry would pay user fees to augment the resources of the Food and Drug Administration devoted to the review of human drug applications. PDUFA I has succeeded in substantially reducing review times for human drug applications, bringing those drugs to the market sooner than before. 
At some point in the debate I would like to engage a colloquy with Senator Mikulski, a cosponsor of S. 830, to discuss the importance of the performance enhancements that PDUFA will bring to the drug review process. We have all benefited from Senator Mikulski's determination to bring the Food and Drug Administration into the 21st century for the benefit of her own constituents who work at the FDA, for the betterment of the burgeoning biotechnology sector in Maryland, and for the parties throughout America who are served by the technologies developed by those companies. 
Title VII of S. 830, or PDUFA II, would build on the original 
legislation by codifying new commitments from FDA to implement more ambitious and comprehensive improvements in the regulatory process. PDUFA I focused on reducing the length of time taken by FDA in reviewing an application. The committee commends FDA for successfully meeting, and at times exceeding, the performance goals established at PDUFA I. However, while review times for submitted applications have improved, the period of time taken to get the drug through the drug development phase has recently increased from 5 to 7 years. Appropriately, PDUFA II will focus on shortening overall development time. 
It will streamline interaction with the FDA during the highly regulated drug development phase and also establish new performance levels and procedures for FDA that are designed to reduce the time required to show that a drug is ready for FDA review. 
The bill provides improved access to new treatments and important information needed by patients. Section 102 establishes a statutory right for any person, acting through a physician, to request an investigational drug, biological product, or device for diagnosis of a serious disease or condition. This provision builds upon current FDA programs that have proved so successful for aids and cancer drugs, and this is an area that is critical to all of us. 
This section of the bill includes modifications urged by the FDA and patient groups, that codify important patient protections. These provide patient access under their physician's supervision, to unapproved therapies, under the existing emergency use, and investigational device and drug treatment exemption programs. 
Another important provision advocated by the patient groups as one of their top priorities is section 808, which establishes a registry of clinical trials, both publicly or privately funded, of experimental drugs and biological or serious life-threatening medical conditions. 
Registry information must be understandable to the general public and include the purpose of experimental protocol, trial eligibility criteria, and sites and contact points for people wishing to enroll in a clinical trial. It is critical that those people who are suffering from the diseases of this nature be able to find out how they can get involved and be able to take part in a program which is designed to bring them back to health. Patients, health care providers, researchers, and the public would access the registry through toll-free telephone communications and other informational systems. This provision was included in the bill as an amendment offered by Senator Dodd, based on legislation introduced by Senator Snowe and Senator Feinstein. We are all grateful for their leadership in this area. I should add that Senator Dodd, who is a cosponsor of S. 830, must be recognized for his early and unflagging support for enacting broad-based reform this year. He has worked incredibly hard and has been one of the most steadfast leaders in bringing forth a bipartisan bill. 
Yet another provision designed to speed new drugs to patients who need them is section 613. The FDA currently has a number of mechanisms aimed at streamlining the development and approval process for new therapies for serious and life-threatening conditions. Section 613 establishes a statutory mechanism for identifying breakthrough drugs early in the product development phase. It provides sponsors of such drugs a reasonable opportunity for early interaction with the agency to further help streamline the development and approval process for such drugs. 
This provision is intended to clarify and to coordinate some of FDA's mechanisms for new drugs and biological products that are intended for the treatment of serious and life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such conditions. It defines and clarifies a process pursuant to which sponsors of these drugs may interact with the FDA, and includes provisions that will ensure that these processes are well known and well understood. 
I want to mention other changes made in the substitute that have been the subject of discussion between the committee markup and floor consideration. 
I want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to know what we will be voting on and that they will have an opportunity to review this and, hopefully, fully understand it. Certainly, my staff, and I am sure Senator Kennedy's staff is available to enlighten them if they have questions. I urge all members to take a look at the bill that is now before the Senate. 
The third-party review provision has undergone substantial revision since its was first debated in the 104th Congress. This provision has been developed under the leadership of Senator Coats, who has played an important role in advancing FDA modernization throughout this process. This year, he has played a special role in the development of S. 830 from its inception and provided wise counsel on how to achieve the best possible reform at the FDA. The third-party review pilot in this bill moves important expansion to the current FDA third-party review program for medical devices. 
I should mention that two amendments to the provision on third-party review for medical devices offered by Senator Harkin in committee, which were not agreed to, did form the basis for subsequent compromise reflected in the substitute now before the Senate. To meet the Senator's concerns and the concerns of others, the bill sponsors have agreed to statutory language establishing the right of FDA to review records related to compensation arrangements, and excluding from third-party review class III products, products that are implanted for more than 1 year, products that are life sustaining or life supporting, and products that are of substantial importance in the prevention of impairment to human health. 
This was an important provision which brought peace of mind to many and allowed us to come forward with the bill in the form we have now. 
These changes in scope and the additional safeguards to protect against conflict of interest broaden public confidence in this pilot and provide FDA with a needed tool to manage an increasing workload of medical device reviews. 
Two other critical provisions to improve the medical device review program will make the review process more efficient and collaborative for high-technology products--those which offer the greatest benefit for patients and which also experience the longest review times at FDA. Senator Wellstone is the sponsor of legislation to reform the medical device approval process that includes these two provisions and others in S. 830, and I applaud his leadership on these issues. Section 301 creates the opportunity for a manufacturer to meet with FDA to establish the type of scientific evidence necessary to demonstrate effectiveness for a device. FDA had earlier concerns about binding determinations of device data requirements needed to show efficacy. In response to the FDA, the provision has been modified to ensure that the agency will receive sufficient information to make such a determination and is provided authority to modify the determination where appropriate. 
Manufacturers should not have to spend months wondering if their application is still on track in the review process. 
Section 302 requires the agency to meet with manufacturers 100 days after a premarket approval application is submitted to discuss deficiencies and any additional information required for approval. This provision, too, was modified to address FDA's concerns that the agency only be required to identify deficiencies known at the time of the 100-day meetings. And FDA would only be required to identify information needed to correct those deficiencies. 
In recognition that the mandatory postmarket surveillance authority established in the 1990 Safe Medical Devices Act was overbroad and inconsistently applied, S. 830 made the current mandatory postmarketing surveillance discretionary and limited surveillance to a 24-month period, unless FDA showed that longer time is needed to track device after marketing. 
Concerns of the FDA and patient group are further addressed in the substitute by striking the portions of the provision establishing new duration and scope limitations on postmarket surveillance--under the agreement the only change to the existing surveillance authority is to make it discretionary, allowing FDA the flexibility to impose surveillance requirements as appropriate without leaving itself or companies in technical violation of the law. 
Another area of disagreement prior to markup was the manner in which S. 830 proposed to handle certain types of manufacturing changes for medical devices. Senate bill 830 proposed to allow these changes to proceed on the basis of a notification rather than a full supplemental application. 
The substitute modifies the provision in the manufacturing changes section so that FDA may in some cases still require the submission of a supplement for a manufacturing change, and such supplement must be approved prior to implementation of the change. These manufacturing change supplements shall be reviewed in 135 days. This compromise will still allow many, if not most, manufacturing changes to proceed under a streamlined process. 
Senator Gregg, who worked very, very hard on this bill, has been certainly one of those who deserves a great deal of credit for bringing it to the body in the form it is in, which I believe is most satisfactory. He is to be also commended for his proposals to streamline the FDA process for the consideration of health claims based on Federal research and his amendments to establish uniformity for over-the-counter [OTC] drugs and cosmetics. 
He has modified this provision to exempt California's proposition 65 and allow States to regulate cosmetic labeling and packaging issues where FDA has not acted. Senate bill 830 authorizes truthful, nonmisleading health claims for food products that are based on published authoritative statements of scientific bodies of the U.S. Government such as the National Institutes of Health. FDA expressed concern regarding the length of time the agency had to assess these proposed claims and the mechanism by which they might prevent a particular claim from going forward. Agreement with FDA was reached on the basis that FDA is given 30 additional days to review a health claim under the provision, for a total of 120 days to review a health claim. FDA is able to prevent the claim from being used in the marketplace by issuing an interim final regulation. FDA may also block a claim from going forward, if the conditions established under the provision governing claims are not met. Again, I thank the Senator for his excellent work in crafting this provision and reaching agreement with the FDA. 
The committee adopted an amendment by Senator Frist which conforms the statute with FDA's current practice and today's science with regard to the quality of data required to show drug efficacy. I am especially grateful to Dr. Frist, a cosponsor of the S. 830, whose medical expertise has lent credibility to the decisions we have made in the complex area of medical technology regulation. 
Senator DeWine, joined by Senator Dodd, offered an important amendment to establish incentives for the conduct of research into pediatric uses for existing and new drugs. 
The bill was improved by Senator Hutchinson's amendment, to establish a rational framework for pharmacy compounding, which respects the State regulation of pharmacy while allowing an appropriate role for FDA. I look forward to participating in a colloquy with the Senator and the ranking minority member on this topic. 
The ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, has played a vital role in bringing this compromise to the floor. In markup, he offered two important amendments adopted by the committee. One amendment, developed in consultation with Senator Gregg, improved a provision from last year's legislation governing the regulation of radiopharmaceuticals. The second improved the bill's provision setting forth a streamlined process for the review of supplemental applications for new uses of approved drugs. 
I commend the Senator for his hard work and willingness to compromise on a number of issues which threatened to hold up proceeding on the bill. We reached agreement on the distribution of health care economic information. This data is the essential information ingredient in the drug selection process in the growing managed care sector of the health insurance marketplace. We agreed to require pharmaceutical companies to report annually on their efforts to comply with postapproval studies. This is essential information needed to provide the assurance that these studies will in fact be completed. Again, I thank the Senator for his willingness to work out these and other compromises. 
Finally, I would like to comment on the involvement of patient and consumer groups: They testified at one of our committee hearings. Also, our staff met a dozen times with representatives of these groups to discuss their proposals, share our ideas and drafts, and debate policy issues. Representatives of these groups were in key meetings with industry, FDA, and bipartisan staff to discuss the resolution of issues they identified as critical--pharmacoeconomics and the requirement of drug companies to comply with postapproval, or phase four, study requirements are examples of where we relied heavily on their advice and were pleased to have their information. 
The bill reflects changes to address their concerns: Companies must report on their compliance with phase four studies; FDA is given express authority to inspect compensation records of third-party reviewers; patients will have access to a registry of clinical trials information; and additional safeguards were built into the provision allowing expanded access to products under clinical investigation. It is clear that these groups have played an active and important role in drafting this bill. 
Mr. President, I stand before the body today with a sense of relief because, for the first time, I feel we are really, without any further delays, coming toward completion. It is also still my purpose and my goal to ensure that all Members will still have an opportunity to express themselves, and that when we come back next time, I hope that we will have an agreement or unanimous consent that we can proceed without the necessity of invoking cloture, and have amendments established to be considered in reasonable lengths of time, so that this bill can move forward. Certainly, I ask those who are desiring to propose amendments, when we come back here next week, to get in touch with us today, tomorrow, and during the weekend and the first of the week so we can try to accommodate all Members who desire to have amendments that they desire to have expeditiously considered. 
I urge all of the body to recognize that this is an important piece of legislation. It has to be acted upon yet by the House. They are anxiously awaiting us to move, so hopefully the bills can be as close together as possible, so that we can have the bill signed into law expeditiously, within a month. 
With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will yield on my time. I thank the Senator for all the work he has put into this bill. I know he is probably one of the strongest consumer advocates this Senate has ever seen. I would like to chat with the Senator just a bit because there is some concern of consumer advocates in my State who say how come we are getting all these editorials? And I would have to say in fairness to this committee they are based upon information which may have been true a month or 2 months or 3 months ago, but we have gone out of our way to put on the web pages--in fact, the most recent agreement which we have reached on cosmetics is now, or will be this afternoon, on the web pages so that all they have to do is tune in and they can see the exact wording. 
So I urge those who are still nervous about what is in the bill to find out. It is available. In the modern age of being able to have information available, it is available instantly around the country. I hope that we would continue to work on the basis of what the bill is instead of what it used to be. 
I acknowledge the Senator's contribution to this effort entirely. The Senator has been instrumental in proposing innovative ideas and finding solutions. He has done an outstanding job in helping myself and Senator Kennedy bring this bill to where it is. The Senator is looked upon by many as a person they can trust to protect the interests of the consumer. So I thank the Senator for his very active participation in this bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I know the intentions of the Senator are certainly the best in wanting to assist our local governments in having a better handle on their educational situation. However, I want to point out several problems with the amendment. I will also say that, given the modifications that have been made, my opposition, as far as the energy involved, has been diminished substantially. Now, we are now talking about only $4 billion, whereas originally the figure was closer to $12 billion. 
Even with those modifications having been made, I still want to raise my colleagues' understanding of what this amendment does. 
A lot of the discussion has been about doing away with Federal involvement, but what the amendment really tends to do is to turn over to local governments functions that are now handled by the States. With the modifications, this is somewhat less the case. 
As a Republican, I have the feeling that the States are better able to control, to help, and otherwise assist local schools than is the Federal Government. This amendment shifts some responsibilities back to the local governments, but also shifts a great bulk of it back to the Federal Government. For that reason, I am a little bit ambivalent as to how serious I consider this amendment. 
I would like to point out one thing that does alarm me, as someone who believes that the States should have more control over things, and that is the fact that the control that we give back to the local governments is very precarious. If you read the amendment, the amendment says: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Education shall award the total amount of funds described. 
I will recount a problem I once had. I had a wonderful amendment to reorder the Nation's priorities in energy. I worked with the committee that handled energy. They adopted all my points, and I thought I had a great victory. Then they said, `Gee, Jim, all we did was change one word in the amendment.' 
I said, `What was that?' 
They changed `shall' to `may.' 
Now, if you were to take your language here and change `shall' to `may,' then the Secretary of Education would have complete control of all these funds. It leaves us in a precarious situation when, with one word, you can change the total impact of this amendment. 
As far as the full impact now, as I mentioned earlier, when you take out title I, you take out a huge, huge chunk of money. When you add to that the programs which were excluded from the 
original amendment, such as IDEA and 50 percent of voc-ed and several other programs, you end up with this amendment affecting a mere $4 billion of the roughly $20 billion made available under this bill for elementary and secondary education programs. So my vigor has diminished substantially. 
But let me also point out that, without any guidelines to the local governments, funding for those programs which are included in the amendment and which is now targetted to try to help special bodies of individuals--Indians or whomever else--can be used in any way whatsoever. 
I remember back when we had revenue sharing. What an embarrassment that turned out to be. I was a great one for revenue sharing: Send it back to the local governments. We found that, instead of doing the things we thought they would do with it, they built skating rinks, fish ponds and others things. So we said, `Gee, we better take it back.' 
I wish I had that much confidence that local governments would make the optimum use of general Federal funds for education. However, they have tight budgets. In my State, almost every town in the State is having a problem with its education budget because of its impact on property taxes. 
There is nothing in the amendment about a maintenance of effort. You don't have to use the funds for additional education programs. You can take that money and replace the tax funds now being used. You don't have to improve your schools at all. You can just merely reduce the property taxes to the people in the community. I bet you, if we pass this and it becomes law, that a few years from now we will find out almost all the money went to property tax relief. 
The problems of education are at the local level. They are not at the Federal level. They are at the local level. We argue about how much the Federal Government should influence the decisions of local governments, but what we have to do is give the local governments the ability, through professional development and assistance from the States, to try to make sure that they are living up to the obligation of educating our children. 
In this Nation right now, 51 percent of the kids who graduate from high school graduate functionally illiterate. We are way in the back, almost last among the more developed nations, in math. We have right now 190,000 jobs in the information-technology area alone for which we can't find people who have the skills to fill them. In Europe and Asia, those skills are taught in high school. 
Is giving money back to localities going to make a difference? I don't believe so. So I am afraid what we have here is a well-intentioned amendment which could backfire completely by a change in one word. 
Let me also say that, although this amendment will not get enacted because it is veto bait, imagine yourself back home after you have voted for this amendment. You are out there, you are debating your opponent, and you say you are in favor of this amendment. He then brings up the amendment and reads it, without knowing the implications: `Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Education shall award all the money.' 
You can argue, but you know how it is trying to argue in a political situation by saying that the language is not really what it meant; that's what it says.  
So, I just think we are not going to accomplish anything of any great dimension in terms of the intent of the amendment--to give the local communities more flexibility with spending. We have cut the States out, and we have a direct linkage now between the Secretary of Education and every local school district--with language just open, ripe for being changed from `shall' to `may' if we should ever lose the majority here. 
Reluctantly, I have concluded that this amendment would be a very serious mistake if we were to pass it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I wish to speak against the amendment. 
I think the desires and the hopes of the Senator from Washington are certainly admirable, but I think if one examines where the problems are in education right now the thought that it will be solved by just giving a blank check to the local agencies to correct these problems I think would find itself quite misdirected. 
First of all, it goes without saying and everybody must recognize that this is probably the grossest exercise of changing the situation from what is normally considered the authorization process that I have seen to date. 
Now, I do not disagree with the fundamental problem that the Senator from Washington recognizes, and that is we have an awful problem in this Nation educationally. When 51 percent of the students in this country graduate functionally illiterate, when we find ourselves trailing way behind other nations in competition for the type of work that is necessary in our country, we know we have a problem. Right now, for instance, we have 190,000 jobs available in this Nation that we cannot fill because schools have not produced students with the skills to take them, whereas our competitors do not have that problem. 
But where is the problem? The problem is at the local level because they have not had the guidance from above or whatever to increase the mathematical skills and to ensure that we do not push young people through the school systems by what is called social promotion. Those are the big problems. Giving blank checks to the local governments is not going to solve the problems. I would guess it would probably exacerbate them. 
For instance, one of the programs that we have which is more aimed at the problems than anything is the Eisenhower math program. It is designed to provide professional development. Congressman Goodling, who is chairman in the House, and I agree on one thing, that the most important thing we can do now is to improve the professional development of our teachers. If they don't know what the standards are they should meet in order to meet worldwide competition, then it is difficult to expect that they are going to change to meet those standards. The Eisenhower program has been very successful in the math area, but it is so small that it cannot possibly do all the work. If we were to take and throw more money, if you want to call it throw, into the Eisenhower program and things like that, it might make some sense. But just to give it carte blanche to the districts dependent on the wealth, not on the quality of education, 
this makes a presumption that is not accurate in many cases, and that is, the quality of your education will be determined by the amount of money that is spent; therefore, if you give more money to the poor areas, they are going to end up with better education, and if you take it away from the ones with higher expenditures on education, they are not going to be hurt. There is no basis for making that kind of conclusion. 
Title VI, a block grant, which is chapter 2, is the best hope we have for getting the kind of professional development which Congressman Goodling and I agree is the greatest need of this Nation today that would eliminate the money that goes toward that direction of trying to make sure that we improve the ability of our teachers to meet modern needs of our society. 
You can argue about some of the other programs, but School to Work is another one. School to Work is putting its finger on the basic problem in this country, and that is that we do not train our young people for work; we ignore that. The educational institutions, in most cases, are just making some progress now with bringing the school into the work area and letting them know what the young people need for skills in order to get those very well-paying jobs that are out there. School to Work is aimed at that. To cut the funding for that and give more money to the local agencies to do what they want with it is not going to solve the problems of this Nation. 
We are going to try to in the Work Force Improvement Act, which we will be moving out of committee very soon, consolidate a lot of these programs that perhaps eat up more money in bureaucracy than they do in producing results. I don't have a problem with that, but that should be done during the reauthorization process. To make such a fundamental change now on an appropriations bill where we would take away from the States--remember, the States distribute title I money and things like that in accordance with not only financial problems, but educational need. This would do away with that aspect and give that role to the Secretary of Education. I am amazed to think the Senator from Washington would suggest we ought to give the money to the Department of Education to distribute. Granted, it is a formula distribution, but still right now it is the States that make the decisions based upon the educational need as well as economic need. 
So I think for all these reasons I would have to strongly oppose this amendment. I encourage, though, as the Senator from Washington has done, to raise the level of understanding of what the problems of this Nation are in education. The basic problem is very fundamental, and that is that the schools in this country are not equipped now to handle the demands made upon them by the competition in the world economic situation which requires us to produce kids that have better skills. 
There is certainly no excuse for allowing young people to go through the school system and come out the other end, like half of our kids do, without knowing how to read. That is why emphasis is being placed by the administration, myself, Congressman Goodling and others on that. We have to face up to the problem. Facing up to the problem is not going to solve it by throwing more money and taking it away from any direction at all, but just giving it to the local school system. 
I must strongly oppose the amendment of the Senator from Washington, but I do praise him in the sense of raising again the awareness of this body and the Nation to the serious problems we have with education at the local level. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I will make a couple more comments here. 
Let us just think about what would happen if we did this, what it would do for education. All of a sudden, without any qualifications or requirements, or anything else, if we were to send checks to our local governments, with a hope they would spend it on education--I know what would happen in my State. 
We have just gone through property tax reform. Everybody is up in arms over the cost to the local governments from property tax reform. I bet if you were to do it, this would end up in property tax relief. Maybe that is a good thing. Maybe it is a good thing to relieve the local property tax in communities around the country. But it is not going to tackle or do anything to solve the very basic problems we have in education. There is nothing in here that would in any way determine that the local governments are going to spend it on education. 
Now, `above' can mean the superintendent of a region, they are knocked out. The State's school system has no control or no suggestions in any way how to spend this money. We are just sending checks to the local communities and saying, `Gee, we would kind of like you to spend this on education, but there's no requirement, or you can say you do, but then you just cut yours back and you spend this money on education, but you cut back on the local money, on what you're spending on education now, and you can cut your property taxes.' It might be very popular. I think it would be. I expect it would sell very well with the taxpayers of local communities saying, `Wow, finally we can start going down on the cost of education in this community.' 
Will it benefit the students? Not at all. This is, again, authorization of the grossest kind in the appropriations process. 
So I say to Members that this is one area where we have huge needs trying to change what is going on in this country in education, to raise the levels to be able to meet international competition, to make sure we are not embarrassed again as we have been for years now on international tests with our young people, especially in math and science. We know we have to make changes. Anyone here who believes that just throwing money at the local communities is going to bring about these kinds of changes, I do not think you will find anyone who can consider this is seriously the way to go. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Vermont's Shelburne Museum on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. The museum, sometimes referred to as New England's Smithsonian, will celebrate its anniversary on September 27, 1997 with a myriad of activities for people young and old. 
The museum's founder, Electra Havemeyer Webb, was a pioneer collector of Americana and American folk art. Today, the museum collects, preserves, and studies art as well as history with an emphasis on the New England area. Thirty-seven exhibit buildings spanning across 45 scenic acres include three galleries, 7 furnished historic homes and over 80,000 objects. The historic buildings and collections reflect our transition from an agricultural to an industrial nation. 
The Shelburne Museum has become an important cultural resource for Vermont and the Nation. In a rapidly changing world its collections as well as its programs provide the public and scholars alike with an opportunity to reflect on and explore the central themes of ingenuity, craftsmanship and creativity. 
The museum embodies a spirit of celebration which provides visitors from across the country and around the world with a unique perspective into the region's history. As a learning tool, it plays a significant role in reminding patrons that the past can often provide a key to the future. 
Mr. President, I wish the Shelburne Museum many more years of continued success in service to our community.

Mr. JEFFORDS. First, I want to thank the majority leader for, I think very aptly and appropriately and eloquently, expressing our thoughts about Mother Teresa. All of us were moved by her life, and all feel similarly as to his feelings about what she did for all the people of the world. 
Mr. President, today, we move forward again on the motion to proceed with respect to the reform of the FDA bill, S. 830. 
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Food and Drug Administration commonly known as FDA, has two important functions: First, the review and approval of important new products that can improve the public health, such as lifesaving drugs, biological products, and medical devices; and second, the prevention of harm to the public from marketed products that are unsafe or ineffective. Since 1938, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act has been amended numerous times to expand the FDA's mission to ensure that only safe or ineffective products are marketed. 
But the act has been changed only once, by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992, commonly called PDUFA, to strengthen the FDA's ability to review and approve expeditiously important new products that can improve the public health. 
Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997, S. 830, is designed to ensure the timely availability of safe and effective new products that will benefit the public and to ensure that our Nation continues to lead the world in new product innovation and development. 
The legislation accomplishes three major objectives: It builds upon recent administrative reforms that both streamline FDA's procedures and strengthen the agency's ability to accomplish its mandate in an era of limited Federal resources; it requires a greater degree of accountability from the agency in how it pursues its mandate; and third, it provides for the reauthorization of PDUFA. 
The FDA acknowledges that its mandate requires it to regulate over one-third of our Nation's products. Within its purview the FDA regulates nearly all of the food and all of the cosmetics, medical devices, and drugs made available to our citizens. 
This legislation identifies areas where improvements can be made that will strengthen the agency's ability to approve safe and effective products more expeditiously. It builds upon the numerous investigations by Congress, the FDA, the General Accounting Office, and other organizations that have identified problems with the current FDA product approval system and have recommended reasonable reforms to streamline and strengthen that system. The major provisions of S. 830 accomplishes, among others, the following purposes. The legislation: 
First, establishes a clearly defined, balanced mission for the FDA; 
Second, it improves patient access to needed therapies and provides expedited humanitarian access to medical devices; 
Third, creates new incentives for determining better pharmaceuticals for children; 
Fourth, gives patients access to new therapies more quickly through a new fast-track drug approval process; 
Fifth, increases access to information by health professionals and patients; 
Next, increases agency access to expertise and resources; 
Also, improves the certainty and clarity of rules; 
And further, improves agency accountability and provides for better resources allocation by setting priorities; 
It also, simplifies the approval process for indirect food contact substances and provides a more reasonable standard for some health claims; and, 
The legislation reauthorizes the PDUFA Program thus ensuring additional resource availability for the agency to conform with its necessary missions. 
Mr. President, let us explore these objectives in greater detail. First, the legislation establishes a clearly defined, balanced mission for the FDA. Congress has never established a mission statement for the FDA. This bill does. 
The FDA in March 1993 adopted a formal statement declaring that the agency `is a team of dedicated professionals working to protect and promote the health of the American people.' Although this statement defines the agency's mission in terms of ensuring that the products it regulates comply with the law, there is no reference to the importance of approving new products that benefit the public. 
The legislation amends the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act by adding an agency mission statement focused on: First, protecting the public health by ensuring that the products it regulates meet the appropriate FDA regulatory standards; second, promptly and efficiently reviewing clinical research and taking appropriate action on the marketing of regulated products in a manner which does not unduly impede innovation or product availability; and, third, participating with other countries to reduce regulatory burdens, harmonize regulatory requirements, and achieve appropriate reciprocal arrangements with other countries. 
The legislation improves patient access to needed therapies and provides expedited humanitarian access to medical devices. The FDA has no crosscutting program that ensures access by patients with serious or life-threatening diseases to drugs or devices in clinical trials--even when that unapproved therapy may be the only way to save the patient's life. 
The legislation would create new law whereby manufacturers may provide, under strictly controlled circumstances and in response to a patient's request, an investigational product for those patients needing treatment for a serious or life-threatening disease. The legislation also improves the existing program for the humanitarian use of medical devices for patient populations of fewer than 4,000. 
The legislation creates new incentives for determining better pharmaceuticals for children. Children have for years been wrongly considered small adults when estimating the effect of prescription drugs on their overall health. Currently there is no systematic means for testing the safety and efficacy of drugs on the pediatric population. 
The legislation gives the Secretary authority to request pediatric clinical trials for new drug applications and provides 6 extra months of market exclusivity to drugs when the manufacturer voluntarily meet certain conditions under the program. The Secretary must determine in writing that information relating to the use of a drug in the pediatric population is needed. In addition, the FDA may establish time frames for completing such pediatric studies before additional exclusivity is granted. 
The legislation gives patients access to new therapies more quickly through a new fast-track drug approval process. I think this is important. 
For several years the FDA has allowed the expedited review and approval of drugs but such review has been largely confined to treatments for HIV/AIDS or cancer. This provision facilitates development and expedites approval of new drugs for the treatment of any serious or life-threatening diseases. 
The legislation increases access to information by health professionals and patients. For years, sophisticated users of health related economic information, like health maintenance organizations, have had constrained from access to important information that could help them reduce health care costs. 
The legislation would apply the Federal Trade Commission's `competent and reliable scientific evidence' standard for FDA review of health care economic statements distributed by manufacturers to sophisticated purchasers. In the past, only a few patient groups have had access to information about ongoing clinical trials for lifesaving therapies. The legislation expands patient access to information by requiring the creation of data bases on ongoing research related to the treatment, detection, and prevention of serious of life-threatening diseases. 
The legislation increases agency access to expertise and resources. Current law contains no provisions to assure that the FDA can access expertise housed at the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and other science-based Federal agencies to enhance the scientific and technical expertise available to FDA's product reviewers. The legislation requires FDA to develop programs and policies to foster such collaboration. The legislation also authorizes the agency to contract with outside experts to review all or parts of applications when it will add to the timeliness or quality of a product review, and provides for the use of accredited outside organizations for the review of medical devices. 
The legislation improves the certainty and clarity of rules. The legislation makes a series of changes related to the classification, review and approval of FDA regulated products designed to ensure that sponsors of new products face consistent and equitable regulatory requirements. In addition, the legislation gives FDA 2 years to evaluate the success of its recently issued `Good Guidance Practices' guidance after which FDA is required to implement this policy as a regulation, making any modifications necessary to reflect experience during the 2-year trial period. The legislation provides medical device manufacturers with the ability to make recommendations to the FDA respecting initial product classifications. 
It facilitates the reclassification and/or approval of device applications by allowing FDA to consider historical data in making its determinations, and the legislation more clearly states the relationship of labeling claims to approval and clearance of medical devices. It increases the certainty of review time frames by providing a definition of a day with respect to the agency's review timeclock and by requiring the agency to approve or disapprove a device application within 180 days. 
The legislation also prohibits FDA from withholding the initial classification of a device because of a failure to comply with any provision of the unrelated to making a determination of substantial equivalence, and it clarifies that FDA has discretion in determining the number of clinical trials required for the approval of a drug or device. FDA would retain total discretion to require a sufficient number of trials to show safety and efficacy. The provision introduces the concept that two trials are not always necessary, establishes the primacy of quality data over quantity of data, and requires the FDA to consider the number and type of trials on a product-by-product basis. 
The legislation improves agency accountability and provides for better resource allocation by setting priorities. Except as required under PDUFA, the FD&C Act provides no form of public accountability by the FDA for its performance of its statutory obligations. 
The legislation requires FDA to develop a plan designed to: First, minimize deaths and injuries suffered by persons who may use products regulated by the FDA; second, maximize the clarity and availability of information about the product review process; third, implement all inspection and post-market monitoring provisions of the act by 1999; fourth, ensure access to the scientific and technical expertise necessary to properly review products; fifth, establish a schedule to bring the FDA into compliance by 1999 with the product review times in the act for products submitted after the date of enactment of this section; and sixth, eliminate the backlog of products awaiting final action by the year 2000. 
The legislation also requires FDA to submit an annual report to assist Congress in assessing the agency's performance in accomplishing the objectives laid out in the agency plan. 
The legislation streamlines several FDA functions with respect to certain review and inspection processes thus allowing the agency to focus its limited resources on areas of greatest need. The legislation establishes reasonable data requirements for new product approval applications, petitions, or other submissions. The legislation provides FDA with the discretion to approve drugs and biologics on the basis of products manufactured in pilot and small-scale facilities. 
FDA is also directed to establish policies to facilitate the approval of supplemental applications for new uses for an approved product. Further, the legislation establishes procedures and policies to foster a collaborative review process between the agency and the sponsors of medical device applications. Finally, the legislation streamlines the review of minor modifications to medical devices. 
The legislation simplifies the approval process for indirect food contact substances and provides a more reasonable standard for some health claims. Current law requires the agency to preapprove food contact substances, most of which pose little if any risk to human health. 
The legislation replaces the preapproval process for these substances, primarily packaging materials, with a simple notification requirement. The legislation also provides for health claims for foods, with premarket notification, when the claims are based on authoritative recommendations by an authoritative scientific body of the U.S. Government such as the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the National Academy of Sciences--very reliable agencies. 
The legislation reauthorizes the PDUFA Program thus ensuring additional resource availability for the agency. PDUFA is reauthorized for 5 years. Performance goals beyond those set for the 1992 act will be identified in side letters between the FDA and the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. The bill assumes that FDA will receive for fiscal year 1998 the 1997 level of appropriated funds for the agency. 
This is important to keep in mind. For fiscal year 1999 through 2002, the bill assumes an annual inflation adjustment. I mention this because there in the present proposal by the administration is a request to cut back on the use of PDUFA. 
Mr. President, I think after all of us have had time in this body to go through this legislation, Members will understand why there is so little dispute over almost all of the bill. We will be talking again today, as we did last Friday, about two areas in the bill for which there has not been agreement, but the disagreements are not very complicated to understand. 
First of all, we had a vote of 89-5 on Friday to allow us to end the filibuster under the circumstances we faced. That approval indicates what I am saying now, that for almost all of this bill there is no dispute between us and the minority or Senator Kennedy or the Office of the President or the Secretary of HHS. 
What we do have are two problems in which there is dispute. This makes up 6 pages out of a 152-page bill. Keep in mind, because we will have some vigorous arguments in those two areas, everyone agrees with the rest of the bill--almost. There will always be somebody, but there is hardly any disagreement on the matters I discussed in my statement. 
The two remaining matters refer, first of all, to cosmetics. There is an increasing need, at least felt by especially some States and also by the FDA and others, that there has to be more work done in approving cosmetics or ensuring that cosmetics that are injurious to health do not get on the market. At present, most of that has been left sort of ambiguous whether the FDA should do it or not. 
On the other hand, because of the realization that uniformity would be helpful, it would be useful if we could have uniformity throughout the States on cosmetics so that the people all over the country do not have to worry about going from place to place. 
And thus the bill does establish the FDA predominance in the field with respect to the use of cosmetics. 
Now, this is met with some difficulties because some States, California in particular, had voted and had passed laws on cosmetics. Let me go through the present authority. 
The FDA now has substantial authority to ensure the safety of cosmetic products. It can ban or restrict ingredients for safety reasons, mandate warning labels, inspect manufacturing facilities, issues regulatory letters, seize illegal products, enjoin unlawful activities, and prosecute violators of the adulteration and misbranding provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
In addition, cosmetic products are subject to one of the most comprehensive set of Federal labeling requirements for consumer products. A cosmetic label must include the name and address of the manufacturer, packager, or distributor; a statement of product identity; net quantity of contents; a list of all ingredients in the products; adequate directions for use; and mandated warnings for specific products. 
In addition to this substantial Federal regulatory authority, the cosmetic industry supports a variety of programs to ensure the safety of cosmetic ingredients. Most important is the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, a 20-year program that has reviewed the safety of almost 620 cosmetic ingredients. 
The safety evaluations are conducted by an independent expert panel of seven leading academic scientists and physicians. The panel also includes three liaison representatives from the FDA, the Consumer Federation of America, and private industry. 
Along with this regulatory authority, the agency has sufficient resources to police the safety of cosmetics. This year, Congress appears ready to approve nearly a billion dollars for the agency. Yet of that amount, the FDA will likely spend no more than about $6 1/2 million on cosmetics safety and labeling. Why? Why would the agency devote less than 1 percent of its budget? Because of the outstanding safety record of cosmetic products. Numerous FDA Commissioners--including David Kessler, have stated that cosmetics are among the safest products under the FDA's jurisdiction. 
Let me turn now to the language of the national uniformity provision for cosmetics included in the latest version of S. 830. First, let me emphasize that this provision in no way affects State enforcement powers, such as seizure, embargo, or judicial proceedings, that the States can now use to guard against adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise unsafe products. Let me repeat this point: The national uniformity provision would not block any State from exercising its police powers against unsafe cosmetic products. 
Second, the national uniformity provision provides only limited preemption of State safety standards. Preemption would apply only when the FDA has an applicable safety standard affecting cosmetic already in place. If the FDA has not acted in a safety area, the States would still be free to impose their own particular safety regulations affecting cosmetic products. For example, individual States could ban particular ingredients or could set specified concentrations levels for ingredients used in cosmetic products when the FDA has not acted. 
Preemption does apply to State labeling and packaging for cosmetic products that are in addition to or not identical with Federal standards. 
This is designed to ensure a single, nationwide system for regulating the labeling for cosmetic products. This will promote efficient product distribution in interstate commerce, assure the ready availability of products in all States, and hold down costs for consumers. 
Third, under this provision States and localities are clearly permitted to petition to impose a State-specific requirement if they have a situation where an important public interest is at stake, and the requirement would not violate a Federal law or unduly burden interstate commerce. 
Fourth, the existing right of States, or entity or person is preserved to petition the FDA to make an certain regulation on over-the-counter drugs or cosmetics a national requirement. 
And finally, the regulation of the practices of pharmacy and medicine, areas traditionally and appropriately the responsibility of the States is not modified or preempted by this provision. 
This is a sensible compromise that guards against the possibility of 50 different labels in 50 different States but at the same time preserves the ability of States to protect the public against any problems that may arise over the safety of cosmetic products. 
Mr. President, we will go forward with another lengthy dissertation on this aspect of this. I hope people will keep in mind that there is broad, broad agreement among all of us--Senator Kennedy and those who support it--that this bill has come a long way. It has gone a great distance toward bringing together what we can pass and be very proud of. There are just two areas where there is disagreement, which we will hear about, I am sure, now. But I hope that everybody will keep in mind that this is in the area of 6 pages of a 152-page bill. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I commend the Senator. His expertise in this area has helped us greatly and I am sure will lead us to a final conclusion here. 
I would also like to point out as another member of a small State, how we would suffer if we had to rely upon others, since we have no resources to do any of this investigation ourself. We would be placed in a position without uniformity to have to rely on some big State or something to tell us what we should or should not do. We really have no ability in ourselves to protect our citizens, that we would like to. I wonder if you would agree with that as well?

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I only anticipate speaking for a few minutes. I know Senator Coats will follow me. 
This legislation to modernize the Food and Drug Administration and reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act will, upon enactment, streamline the FDA's regulatory procedures. This modernizing will help the agency review medical devices and drugs more expeditiously and will let the American public have access sooner to newer, safer, and more effective therapeutic products. 
I am disappointed that some of my Democratic colleagues are still attempting to block this bill. 
I am especially chagrined given the months of bipartisan negotiating that have led to this bill. Each major provision--every drug issue and all but one medical device provision of this measure, represents long-sought agreements with the minority and with the FDA itself. We have made significant concessions on the uniformity provision objected to by the Senator from Massachusetts to ensure that a State may act on cosmetic safety issues in the absence of FDA action. I do not understand this continued objection and delay. In particular, I am disappointed that after countless hours and many concessions to his point of view, the ranking minority member is opposing progress in passage. And I must add that I wish to applaud his willingness--and his tenacity--in working through several difficult issues to reach a consensus on 99 percent of this legislation. In addition Secretary Shalala and the FDA itself, has worked diligently, to reach reasonable, sensible agreements. This is a good, bipartisan measure that represents moderate, yet real reforms. There is no reason for further delay. 
On June 11, prior to the committee markup of S. 830, I received a letter from Secretary Shalala outlining the Department's key concerns. In her letter the Secretary stated:  
I am concerned that the inclusion of non consensus issues in the committee's bill will result in a protracted and contentious debate. 
Before and since our committee markup, we have worked hard to achieve a consensus bill. And the measure before us today accomplishes that goal. Bipartisan staff have worked diligently with the agency to address each of the significant nonconsensus provisions raised by the Secretary. 
The American people will hardly believe that anyone would suggest that disagreement over 6 pages out of a total of 152 is grounds for holding up consideration of this important bill. A little over a month ago, we all joined together to further the economic health of the country by voting for an historic budget bill, despite our many misgivings, on each of our part, on far more than 6 pages of that legislation. We must do no less here to promote the physical health of our citizens by moving forward to approve S. 830. 
In her letter, Secretary Shalala felt the legislation would lower the review standard for marketing approval. Key changes have been made to the substitute to address these concerns. With respect to the number of clinical investigations required for approval, changes were made to assure that there is not a presumption of less than two well controlled and adequate investigations--while guarding against the rote requirement of two studies. The measure clarifies that substantial evidence may, when the Secretary determines that such data and evidence are sufficient to establish effectiveness, consist of data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence, totally under the control of the FDA. 
Concerns were raised also about allowing distribution of experimental therapies without adequate safeguards to assure patient safety or completion of research on efficacy. Changes to accommodate those concerns were made. We tightened the definition of who may provide unapproved therapies and gave the FDA more control over the expanded access process. 
Other changes will ensure that use of products outside of clinical trials will not interfere with adequate enrollment of patients in those trials and also give the FDA authority to terminate expanded access if patient safeguard protections are not met. The provision allowing manufacturers to charge for products covered under the expedited access provision was deleted also. 
In mid-June, the Secretary argued that S. 830 would allow health claims for foods and economic claims for drugs and biologic products without adequate scientific proof. 
In response, Senator Gregg agreed to changes that would allow the FDA 120 days to review a health claim and provide the agency with the authority to prevent the claim from being used in the market place by issuing an interim final regulation. In addition, the provision allowing pharmaceutical manufacturers to distribute economic information was modified to clarify that the information must be based on competent and reliable scientific evidence and limited the scope to claims directly related to an indication for which the drug was approved. That problem is taken care of. 
This bill was further changed to accommodate the Secretary's opposition to the provision that would allow third party review for devices. 
Products now excluded from third party review include class III products, products that are implantable for more than 1 year, those that are life-sustaining or life-supporting, and products that are of substantial importance in the prevention of impairment to human health. In addition, a provision advocated by Senator Harkin has been incorporated that clarifies the statutory right of the FDA to review records related to compensation agreements between accredited reviewers and device sponsors. I would add that FDA's existing stringent regulations which protect against conflicts of interest in today's third-party review program would apply to the expanded program created by this bill. 
Finally, the Secretary was concerned about provisions that she felt would burden the Agency with extensive new regulatory requirements that would detract resources from critical agency functions without commensurate enhancement of the public health. This legislation now gives FDA new powers to make enforcement activity more efficient, adds important new patient benefits and protections, and makes the review process more efficient. 
First, we give FDA new powers and clarify existing authority, including mandatory foreign facility registration, seizure authority for certain imported goods, and a presumption of interstate commerce for FDA regulated products. 
Second, to assist patients with finding out about promising new clinical trials, we establish a clinical trials database registry accessed by an 800 number. Patients will also benefit from a new requirement that companies report annually on their compliance with agreements to conduct post-approval studies on drugs. 
Third, FDA's burden will be eased by provisions to make the review process more collaborative. Collaborative review will improve the quality of applications for new products and reduce the length of time and effort required to review products. We also expressly allow FDA to access expertise at other science based agencies and contract with experts to help with product reviews. 
Lastly, by expanding the third-party review pilot program for medical devices, we build on an important tool for the agency to use in managing an increasing workload in an era of declining Federal resources. 
In closing, I would echo another part of Secretary Shalala's June 11 letter: 
I want to commend you and members of the Committee on both sides of the aisle on the progress we have made together to develop a package of sensible, consensus reform provisions that are ready for consideration with reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act . . . 
. . . a protracted and contentious debate . . . would not serve our mutual goal of timely reauthorization of PDUFA and passage of constructive, consensus bipartisan FDA reform. 
From the beginning of this process, all of the stakeholders have been committed to producing a consensus measure--and we have accomplished that goal. There is overwhelming agreement on this bill. For those who still oppose a few pages of this bill I can only say that we will continue to bend over backward to accommodate their concerns and to bring about an even closer consensus. Dozens and dozens of changes have been made. The Secretary of Health and Human Services knows that we will continue to work with her--this is not the end of the line. But at some point, the Senate must move on, and we have reached that point, Mr. President. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, which restores $35 million to the State Student Incentive Grant [SSIG] Program. 
SSIG is an effective Federal/State partnership program which leverages State dollars for need-based student aid. 
Ensuring that students have need-based grant aid available to them is very important--especially when one considers the extraordinary debt that many college students have taken on to pay for school. In 1995-96 SSIG benefited 688,000 students through the country and the median family income of those students was $12,000. In Vermont, 4,260 students received assistance through SSIG. 
It is my hope that the Senate will vote in support of this important program. As chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I look forward to a thoughtful review and strengthening of SSIG as part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. 
So again, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for offering this amendment and thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, for his support.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, Senator Mikulski will be here shortly. I would like to make a few comments before I turn the floor over to her. 
With respect to the devices, as I pointed out earlier and I just want to refresh everybody's recollection, the bill that we are dealing with is 152 pages long. The matters on devices are two pages. The matters on cosmetics are four. I thank the Senator from Illinois for bringing attention to some possible problems with respect to ensuring, as we all want to ensure, that there is no conflict of interest involved with any of the companies that they will be dealing with. 
I point out, first of all, that the FDA has total control over the third parties that will be allowed for the purposes of reviewing. They have total control over that. There are already regulations which propose to correct most of the problems, although a couple others have been raised, and we certainly are going to seriously consider amendments that will take care of those problems. 
Let me go through the provisions right now on the existing regulations for FDA: 
Can't own a device company; 
Can't have any ownership or financial interest in any medical device company; 
Can't participate in the development of medical products; 
Can't be a consultant; 
Can't prepare advice for companies; and 
Fees cannot be contingent on third-party recommendation. 
In addition, I emphasize that the FDA has a list of those they have examined, have gone through to make sure that they are appropriate for the purposes of assisting--assisting--FDA in coming to conclusions on these devices. 
There are some protections: 
Can't obtain reviews for the same product from more than one third-party organization; 
Can't contract for a substantial number of reviews, like more than 10 a year, from the same review organization on different devices; and 
Can't contract for reviews from the same review organization where the sum of fees is substantially like $50,000 one year when the other organizations have the same capacity. 
So there are many protections now. Of course, we are very concerned, along with the Senator from Illinois, and want to make sure we have taken care of every possible situation. 
With respect to the legislatures and the Governors, I will point out that the discussion in that regard has been very limited to certain provisions, but I want to enter into the Record a letter which came to the majority leader, Senator Lott, from Gov. Tom Carper from the State of Delaware, chairman of the Committee on Human Resources, and Gov. Tom Ridge, the vice chair of the Committee on Human Resources. I will read that for the Record:  
On behalf of the nation's Governors, we are writing to express our support for swift passage of bipartisan FDA reform and a reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). 
Better health care for all Americans is a paramount national goal that is strongly supported by the Governors. An important component to improved health care delivery is the development and approval of safe and effective new medical technology. New therapies, for example, have the potential to improve the lives of millions of Americans and may, in many instances, reduce health care costs. 
The Governors also recognize that the competitiveness of the U.S. pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries--and the hundreds of thousands of people they employ in our states--is dependent on bringing products to market safely and quickly. Constructive reform will improve the efficiency of the approval process while continuing to protect the public's health and safety. 
We have the support of the Governors. They are not going to go through everything. Generally, they support what we are doing. That is why we had an 89-to-5 vote today to move forward.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Maryland whose untiring efforts have enabled us to come forward here with an excellent piece of legislation, her undying efforts on behalf of FDA and the people of Maryland and the rest of the country to ensure that they are an effective, efficient operation and they do all that is possible and appropriate to protect the interests of others. There is no one I relied on more who has done more to bring about this bill in the shape that it is in and in a position where I feel confident that it can pass. So I thank the Senator very, very much for her effort. 
Mr. President, I know of no other Members on my side of the aisle who desire to speak and I do not believe there are those on the other side, other than Senator Kennedy. 
I make a point of order that a quorum is not present for the purpose of allowing other Members to notify me if they do desire to come and speak and we will certainly accommodate them. I will wait for at least 5 minutes for a response. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JEFFORDS. My present intention is to make some final remarks myself and then to yield back the time on behalf of the majority. It is my understanding, as the Senator has said, that he intends to proceed for some time and perhaps have one additional speaker, and it is my understanding at that time that he will yield back his time. I am not concerned for the presentation of the majority because we have another 4 hours on this on Monday morning, I believe, so we will have ample time--just to reassure the majority--we will have ample time on Monday to take care of any situation which may arise. 
Before I complete my remarks, I want to refresh people where we are, especially on the critical issues that have been raised by the Senator from Massachusetts. I understand there are concerned people, and I am well aware of editorials and groups who have raised issues, most of which I have found not to be relevant to the bill which we are considering. Many of those problems were related to last year's bill and we are assured the whole country has available to them the bill before us here by having it on Web pages and all. I am hopeful those groups who have expressed their deep concerns will review the legislation that is before the Senate and not make conclusions or alarm the public based upon provisions which were in the bill which did appear before this body last year but of course were not voted on. 
First, I remind everyone we voted 89-5 to proceed on this legislation. It is clear that the large majority of the Members here believe and have full confidence that any problems that may exist in the bill will be taken care of. I remind everyone, as I hold this bill up, it is 152 pages long. The areas we are concerned with are two, basically. One is cosmetics. That is an area of deep concern to all of us and the present status of things without this legislation. That is four pages in the bill. There are another two pages on the problems which some see with respect to medical devices and the approval process for them. The issues there have been narrowed down to very small issues, but they are important. I do not diminish that at all. 
With respect to the cosmetics, and that is where the most concern has been expressed, and rightfully so because of the present situation with respect to cosmetics, there is little or no assistance or help to the public in understanding as to whether there are problems, health problems, created by cosmetics. The industry itself has done a great deal to work within the industry to try and ensure they have adequate understanding of what the contents of the cosmetics are and they have tried to eliminate to the extent possible any potential harm to individuals. That has apparently been fairly successful. 
On the other hand, the present situation with respect to governmental influence in trying to protect the public or trying to allow people to determine the safety of the utilization of cosmetics, there has really been no effort to do this which is satisfactory to us and to the American public generally. The issues are raised in a way that explain what the present situation is and make it look like that is what the bill is. That is not what the bill is. The bill is trying to take care of the concern that the public has with the present situation of not being aware or officially find ways to determine whether or not cosmetics are harmful. 
What the bill does is to say not only should the FDA get into this and reassure the public on cosmetics but that they should do that with an eye toward uniformity so that if you buy something in Vermont it does not tell you one thing and you find if you buy it in California, something else, or other places have no warnings. You do not have any way to judge if the product you may be using is one that is safe. 
Now, the States have had authority to move into this area and thus to point out that this will somehow interfere with the States. You have to remember they have had this authority forever, I guess, and only one State has taken it upon themselves to really do anything in this area to try and solve the problem--not the best of ways, to determine what cosmetics are good or bad for your health. 
What did we do? We said, `OK, California, fine, we will not get involved with preempting you with respect to your laws that are on the books. We will allow those laws to stand. The FDA can work around that.' But on the other hand, we will tell the other States that you are free, too, unless the FDA has moved in on those specific products and has made a determination and has exercised its authority, in which case you would be preempted. 
Now, that leaves a narrow problem we are dealing with and is one of the reasons, perhaps the only reason, we are here, and that is suppose a State should say no, not only is that cosmetic going to cause possibly skin cancer, it may also cause blood poisoning, and the FDA only includes skin cancer. Can we not tell our people they should be protected against blood poisoning? We have not quite resolved that. It does not seem irresolvable to me or make the bill horrible because I have that much confidence in the FDA. 
With respect to the devices, again, that is two pages of the bill. With respect to that, it gets down to another problem for the industry, and that is, when they have a device and they say we have studied it and this is the intended purpose of that device and the studies have gone on and it shows it is effective and safe for this purpose, FDA says, yes, but there may be some other uses of that, so we want to do studies on all possible uses of that device. The industry says, well, wait a minute, it is being produced for this purpose, being sold for this purpose, intended for this purpose; we should not have to run all these studies on other things that somebody dreams it may be used for. 
The issue of tobacco has been raised. We were concerned, also, that the tobacco devices--I don't know what they might be, but obviously filter-type things, or whatever else, I don't know. Anyway, we were concerned about that. So, first of all, we asked the CRS as to whether or not the bill, as presently drafted, in the device areas would in any way allow tobacco devices to be sold out from under the bill and, therefore, create problems and a very serious situation in tobacco. I have the CRS study that was done.

Mr. JEFFORDS. This clearly sets out that, in their opinion, it would appear that, in its current form, our bill would not interfere or substantially negatively affect any of the FDA tobacco authority. 
In addition to that, just to be double and triple sure, we, in the bill, say it can't apply to tobacco and that the FDA has full authority in the tobacco area. So that is why we got the 89 to 5 vote today. Yet, I certainly commend the Senator from Massachusetts, and others, who want to make darn sure that we are really doing the job we think we are doing. I appreciate that and I think it is healthy. The harder that Senator Kennedy fights, the more the public will be aware of that, and I hope we have as good a vote this time. 
Mr. President, with that, on behalf of the majority, I will yield back the time that we have today, except that I will provide the Senator from Minnesota 5 minutes at his disposal, at such time as he is appropriately available to make a statement. I would be happy to make that time available for the Senator.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to most sincerely thank my colleagues for the tremendous vote to move forward on FDA reform. This is most rewarding. All of the proponents and supporters are pleased to know that we can go forward at this time. 
This is a tribute to a lot of hard work and compromise from a lot of Members on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the issue. The vote represents the best of bipartisanship from Senators who support it, and even from opponents and the administration. Today is just the first step, but it could hardly be a better one. We will need to debate this bill, consider amendments to it and, no doubt, improve it. I believe that there are still changes that can be made to accommodate the concerns that have been expressed here by the opponents. I know we can find solutions to those. 
We will need to debate this bill, consider amendments and, as I say, no doubt, improve it. But I hope by this time next week, the Senate will have given its resounding support to this bill. It is too important to the American people to let it languish. It is too important for us not to move it out as quickly as possible. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to speak for a few moments just to try to allow those of my colleagues who are viewing us here as to why all this controversy. We just saw a vote of 89 to 5 in favor of moving forward with a bill that has come out and is ready to be placed before the body. Why is that occurring with all of these horrible problems which we have just been hearing about? 
Take a look at this bill. This bill is 152 pages long--152 pages long. We are talking about four pages on cosmetics and two pages on medical devices. So we have to keep things in perspective. This bill has tremendous support because in almost every instance the issues that are of concern to people are taken care of. 
But why all of this discussion about cosmetics? Because nobody is doing anything. That is why the controversy. The question is who should do something. Now, the question is whether or not you want some uniformity, and that is the Federal Government, the FDA, which we have tremendous confidence in, to take on the issue of warning about the problems of cosmetics and to have a uniform approach, uniform labels and those things so, if you go from one place to another, you don't get confused about what you should or should not be using or doing. 
That is the question here. It revolves down to this. Right now, the States say, oh, my God, you can't tell us what we can do. Well, they haven't been doing anything, with the exception of California. It is not something we are moving into and pushing aside all existing regulations; there are none. The question is who ought to do it. Well, to California we said, OK, you have that so we will carve you out. Go forward. You have yours out there. That is fine. The Federal Government will not intervene, will not do away with that. So the bill presently says, California, what you have done is fine. The question is everyone else. 
Now, since nobody has moved into this, it is not like you have a whole bunch of States out there panicked because their existing rules and regulations are going to be superseded. It is natural for Governors and State legislatures to scream and say, oh, my gosh, you can't take our power away to do something. 
So where did we get down to before we came here? We got down to this close--this close. This is how close we are. We said, OK, if the FDA has not done something and has not established that this cosmetic is a dangerous one, then the States can move in. And if they feel differently, that it is and therefore we should do it, they have the power to do that. 
That is the way it is right now. But we say that if the FDA has acted, then we want uniformity and so we should try to make sure that people across the country will have uniformity. 
Then the issue was raised, well, suppose the FDA says that it is dangerous because it may cause problems on your face. Suppose the State believes it may have something to do with your blood system. Does that mean they cannot warn people that this cosmetic may be dangerous if it gets into your bloodstream? 
Well, that is the issue. That is how far apart we are. On the two pages that deal with devices, the issue is about as narrow as that. It comes down to the question of, if a manufacturer says this device is for this purpose, and the FDA says, well, maybe we want to make sure that we know all the other purposes it might be used for, so they should alert us to those. We are down that far on those two pages, and we are down to within a few lines on the other four pages, but the other 146 pages there isn't really much disagreement with. 
So I want to make sure we have things in perspective here. That is why the support, that is why we had the 89-to-5 vote on moving forward on this. But these are important issues. It is important for us to make sure that people know that with respect to cosmetics they are going to be protected and who is going to do it and what kind of awareness are we going to be able to have and what are the States rights versus the Federal Government. 
So that is where we are. I will go at length later, but right at this point I want to make sure we understand where we are and what the issue is. In cosmetics, nobody is doing anything now with the exception of the State of California. We think the FDA ought to get in there. They ought to make sure that the cosmetics that are advertised are safe, that we know what problems could be caused and that we have uniformity in the country, so that when you go one place to another, you will have the ability to be able to rely upon uniformity as to what the various products may or may not do to you. 
On the other hand, if the FDA does not take any action and a State thinks that this particular cosmetic or whatever is harmful, then they have the power to act. 
So that is where we are. I want to reassure people that this bill does not ignore the problem of cosmetics. For the first time it really emphasizes that the FDA and the States should do something. What should they do? That is not going to be taken care of in the legislation because we would not know. But we do know that there is a need out there and that the FDA should have the authority to act and that they should have the authority to provide uniformity. But, on the other hand, the States should not be stripped of their rights to protect their people in the event the FDA has not acted. 
Mr. President, I just wanted at this time to pause to try to make sure that everybody understands where we are and why we got the 89-to-5 vote to move forward. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with the distinguished chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Specter and the subcommittee's ranking member Senator Harkin, in opposition to Senator Kyl's amendment to cut funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. While I applaud the Senator from Arizona's goal to increase funding for Pell grants, I can not sanction a move that would essentially gut the LIHEAP program, effectively depriving millions of the disadvantaged, elderly, and disabled of critical assistance. 
Mr. President, the appropriation for LIHEAP has declined more than 50 percent over the past decade, down from $2.1 billion in fiscal 1985. During that time, the eligible population has grown from 23 to 30 million. In Vermont, Federal cutbacks have forced the State to push back the deadline for applying for fuel aid to September 2. Mr. President, I strongly disagree with the contention that the need for fuel assistance has declined since the program's founding. Last winter, two-thirds of the 1,400 Vermonters who missed the State's benefits deadline were denied assistance; and the number of people who ran out of fuel and requested emergency aid doubled. 
Mr. President, Federal cutbacks since 1995 have reduced the number of families in Vermont that receive assistance from over 24,000 to around 12,000 this year. These families should not face the prospect of further cutbacks. 
Mr. President, I want to emphasize to the program's critics that LIHEAP helps the neediest of the needy. As others have already stated, almost 70 percent of recipient families have an annual income of less than $8,000, and 44 percent have at least one member who is elderly and 20 percent have one member who is disabled. Currently, only 5 million families are being served nationally, a million less than 2 years ago. 
Mr. President, this is a time to increase funding for LIHEAP not decrease it. Last month, as cochair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, I spearheaded a letter to Senators Specter and Harkin that asked for an increase in regular funding for LIHEAP so that the program is not forced to rely on releases of emergency funds to meet basic needs. Fifty-five Senators signed on to this letter. 
Mr. President, the Appropriations Committee should be commended for recognizing that the need for LIHEAP is greater than current resources. The committee has included $1.2 billion in so-called advance funds for fiscal 1999. I urge my colleagues to overwhelmingly reject this amendment to cut LIHEAP and support Senators Specter and Harkin in their effort to increase LIHEAP funding in fiscal 1999. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I speak in favor of the Coats amendment and I urge its adoption. I do have problems with the underlying amendment. On the other hand, I recognize that the large majority of Members desire to tell NIH what they should be doing with respect to Parkinson's disease. I also recognize it is a serious problem for those that have Parkinson's disease, and many of my friends across the country do so. 
I think the Coats amendment is an important addition to let NIH know that they have to at least be more forthcoming with respect to the processes they use in determining how they should expend the money in research. I, therefore, commend Senator Coats for bringing this to our attention, and as a way to prevent the need for amendments such as the underlying amendment as we move toward the future.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am submitting, along with Senators Kennedy, DeWine, and Wellstone, a Senate resolution to congratulate the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on its 50th anniversary. 
The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service [FMCS] was created in 1947, as an independent agency, by the Labor-Management Relations Act [Taft-Hartley]. FMCS was established by Congress to resolve collective bargaining disputes which threaten the free flow of commerce and to promote the development of sound and stable labor-management relations. 
The primary focus of the agency's work is on labor-management relations, mediating contract negotiation disputes between companies and the unions representing their employees, and providing training in cooperative processes to help build better labor-management relations. FMCS also was authorized under the Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 to share its expertise in all aspects of mediation, facilitation, and conflict resolution with Federal, State, and local governmental bodies and agencies. In addition to dispute mediation services, FMCS provides preventive mediation services, administers a grants program which provides funding for the creation and operation of joint labor-management committees, and also provides an arbitration service, when disputes arise between the parties over the interpretation of their collective bargaining agreement. 
For 50 years, the men and women of the FMCS have worked tirelessly, and successfully, to accomplish the mission of the Agency, the promotion of `sound and stable industrial peace and the advancement of the general welfare, health and safety of the Nation.* * *' Our resolution recognizes, and commends, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for its 50 years of dedicated service to the Nation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the impending passage of this balanced budget agreement is a historic moment for our nation. This legislation represents a real victory for all Americans. Children, students, families and senior citizens will all benefit from our actions today. This budget not only puts us on a financially responsible path but also protects the Federal social safety net. 
This legislation is built on consensus, and no plan built on compromise can make everyone happy. There are certain provisions that I wish were in this bill and there are other provisions that I feel could have been changed. Overall, though this budget package provides benefits that will strengthen our economy, reduce the tax burden on individuals and families, and eliminate spiraling deficits. 
The measure provides tax relief to families and children, with a permanent $500 per child tax credit under the age of 17. The bill creates incentives for savings and investment with expanded individual retirement accounts, reducing capital gains and increased deductions for small business. But most importantly, this legislation furthers our efforts to provide health care and education for all children. 
This conference report will establish a new $24 billion health care coverage program for as many as 5 million uninsured children. I would like to express my special appreciation to Senator Roth and Senator Lott for including in the children's health initiative a provision that will allow States, like Vermont, whose Medicaid coverage for children already extends beyond 200 percent of poverty, to cover children with incomes 50 percentage points higher than their Medicaid cutoff. I feel this section will give these pioneering States the necessary flexibility and resources to continue moving forward toward the goal of ensuring that all children have access to quality health care. 
With $35 billion in education tax incentives, the bill will ease the burden on students and families paying for higher education. These tax incentives will help families save for college, pay tuition costs while students are in college, and repay funds borrowed to pay for college. The bill's education tax incentives are not limited to college expenses. The bill has a life-long education tax credit to help workers who want to brush-up on their job skills or learn new employment skills. 
In addition, the children's tax credit in this bill will result in meaningful savings for families. For a family with two children, this bill will result in a 1999 tax bill that's $1,000 less than they would have otherwise owed. 
This agreement also recognizes the critical relationship between education and our national economic well-being. In a day and age beset by downsizing, when job skills are constantly becoming outmoded by technological advances and break-throughs in learning, education will be a lifetime endeavor. I am happy that the bill recognizes this, and makes lifetime learning more easily affordable. Aid to education is not limited to tax incentives; the tax incentives are supplemented by meaningful spending increases for scholarship grants and literacy programs. Throughout my years in the Congress, first on the Education and Labor Committee in the House, and now as chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have worked to make education more readily affordable and more easily accessible. This bill represents an important step in that direction. 
During my tenure in Congress I have tried hard to put our fiscal house in order while protecting programs that are important to the nation. I am pleased to cast my vote in favor of this agreement, which I believe does just that. Today, this body is taking a giant step closer to insure the future economic security of our children and the next generation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the impending passage of this balanced budget agreement is a historic moment of our Nation. The vote that my colleagues and I are making in support of this balanced budget agreement is a vote that each American should take pride in. This legislation represents a real victory for all Americans. Children, students, senior citizens, and families will all benefit from our actions today. This conference report will put this country on a financially responsible path while also taking the necessary steps to protect Medicare and provide health care coverage to our Nation's uninsured children. 
This legislation is built on consensus, and no plan built on compromise can make everyone happy. There are certain provisions that I wish were in this bill and there are other provisions that I feel could have been changed. However, it is more important that we move the process forward instead of shutting down the system. Overall, though this budget package provides benefits that will strengthen our economy, reduce the tax burden on individuals and families and eliminate spiraling deficits. 
The measure provides tax relief to families by providing a permanent $500-per-child tax credit for children under the age of 17. The bill creates incentives for savings and investment with expanded individual retirement accounts, reducing capital gains and increased deductions for small business. The legislation provides for estate tax relief which will affect many residents of my home state of Vermont. The bill will impose roughly $297 billion in savings over the next 5 years and $900 billion over the next 10 years while still protecting programs that are vital to the interest of all Americans. But most importantly, this legislation furthers our efforts to provide health care and education for children. 
Mr. President, there is no resource more precious than the children who are right now playing in the school yards from Vermont to California. I worked closely with my colleagues Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee, and Senator Rockefeller to develop legislation that would provide health care coverage for our Nation's uninsured children. This conference report will establish a new $24 billion health care coverage program for as many as 5 million uninsured children. The establishment of this coverage is not the end but only the beginning to ensure that every child born in this country will have a healthy start in order for them to fulfill their own personal American dream. 
I would like to express my special appreciation to Senator Roth and Senator Lott for including in the Children's Health Initiative a provision that will allow States like Vermont whose Medicaid coverage for children already extends beyond 200 percent of poverty to cover children with incomes 50 percentage points higher than their Medicaid cutoff. I feel this section will give these pioneering States the necessary flexibility and resources to continue moving forward toward the goal of ensuring that all children have access to quality health care. In addition, the children's tax credit in this bill will result in meaningful savings for families. For a family with two children, this bill will result in a 1999 tax bill that's $1,000 less than they would have otherwise owed. 
The children's tax credits in this bill will result in meaningful savings for families with children. For a family with two children, this bill will result in a 1999 tax bill that's $1,000 less than they would have otherwise owed. In addition, the bill recognizes the critical relationship between education and our national economic well-being. With $39 billion in education tax incentives, the bill will ease the burden on families paying for higher education. These tax incentives will help families save for college, pay tuition costs while students are in college, and repay funds borrowed to pay for college. And the bill's education tax incentives are not limited to college expenses. The bill has a life-long education tax credit to help workers who want to brush up on their job skills or learn new employment skills. 
This agreement also recognizes the critical relationship between education and our national economic well-being. In a day and age beset by downsizing, when job skills are constantly becoming outmoded by technological advances and breakthrough in learning, education will be a lifetime endeavor. I am happy that the bill recognizes this, and makes lifetime learning more easily affordable. Aid to education is not limited to tax incentives; the tax incentives are supplemented by meaningful spending increases for scholarship grants and literacy programs. Throughout my years in the Congress, first on the Education and Labor Committee in the House of Representatives, and now as chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I have worked to make education more readily affordable and more easily accessible. This bill represents important steps in that direction. 
During my tenure in Congress, I have tried hard to put our fiscal house in order while protecting programs that are important to the Nation. I am pleased to cast my vote in favor of this agreement, which I believe does just that. This plan finally puts four walls and a roof on a foundation toward a balanced budget that this Congress has been building over the last 15 years. Today, this body is taking giant steps closer to ensure the future economic security of our children and the next generation.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Robert A. Starr, Chair of the Vermont House Agriculture Committee and true Vermonter. I pay this tribute in recognition of Mr. Starr's unyielding support for the Northeast Dairy Compact, which on August 20, 1997, provides the first over-order payments so desperately needed by Vermont's dairy farmers. 
`Bobby', as he is known far and wide throughout Vermont, has given lifelong public service to the Vermont agricultural community. Raised on a dairy farm during and after the Second World War, knowledge of hard times and a capacity for hard-bitten labor were ingrained in Bobby, traits which continue to distinguish the character of our hill farmers. After schooling at Vermont Technical College, Bobby followed the lead of his grandfather and became a member of the Vermont House of Representatives in 1979. 
Bobby became a member of the House Agriculture Committee his first year, and has been there ever since. He became Chair in 1987, and has sponsored and provided leadership on a host of initiatives to promote the interests of Vermont agriculture. Bobby has lent his leadership to the variety of Vermont's agricultural pursuits, but it is the dairy industry which has remained at the heart of his vision. Certainly Bobby's upbringing and his strong dairy farm constituency provide the foundation of his knowledge and commitment to the interests of the State's dairy farmers. Yet his vision is broader than just his home district, and indeed has expanded beyond the boarders of Vermont to all of New England. 
It is this unique expansive vision which spawned the dairy compact. Many of us in this body are intimately familiar with the dairy compact, yet few of us may know that the dairy compact was originally sponsored by Bobby Starr in the Vermont Legislature in 1989. 
Few initiatives in my memory have sparked such a vigorous policy debate as the dairy compact. I am proud to have sponsored the compact on behalf of all by colleagues from the New England delegation. Adoption of the compact could not have happened without their hard work here in Congress, and without the years of dedicated work of a veritable army of compact supporters from throughout New England. 
In all, the compact reflects the true spirit of commitment to our dairy farmers. The compact's first payment is a tribute to the hard work and the tireless commitment of Bobby Starr.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to your attention an important report on child abuse and neglect. This report, released in April of this year, examines current research being conducted or supported by the National Institutes of Health [NIH] into the area of child abuse and neglect. The report proposes ground-breaking recommendations for improving the coordination of child maltreatment research across the NIH, with other divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services, and with other federal agencies. In addition, the report addresses the current gaps in research, identified in the National Research Council's 1993 report, `Understanding Child Abuse and Neglect.' The April, 1997, report by NIH emphasizes the need to provide more attention to training new research in the field and disseminating research results to the agencies and practitioners who are working on the frontlines. 
We are all concerned about the prevalence of child abuse and neglect. According to a 1995 state-by-state survey conducted by the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse, over 3.1 million children were reported to be abused or neglected. Child abuse fatalities have increased by 39 percent from 1985 to 1995. The Department of Health and Human Services Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect, released in September, 1996, estimated that the number of child abuse and neglect cases in this country doubled between 1986 and 1993. 
One critical and necessary step to stop child maltreatment is to support research that will enhance our understanding of the underlying causes of child abuse and neglect. This research also will improve our ability to identify and define abuse and neglect, and discover which intervention techniques are most successful in preventing and treating child maltreatment. 
The proposals for future NIH activities contained in the report give new meaning to the concept of knowledge translation and research application. The most important characteristic of the proposals are the efforts to move scientific knowledge from the research lab and demonstration site into professional practice. Parents, child welfare agencies, and practitioners will all benefit from this information and technology transfer. In the exchange, NIH researchers will benefit from the lessons learned by practitioners and be better able to target their research. Everyone will benefit from the increased coordination that is integral to the NIH effort. But most important, fewer children will suffer from abuse and neglect, once marriage between the research and practice is accomplished. This is a goal upon which we can all agree. 
I want to commend Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of NIH, for his leadership in this critical area. Under the direction of Dr. Varmus, Dr. Peter Jensen, Chief-Child and Adolescent Disorders Branch, at the National Institutes of Mental Health established a trans-NIH Working Group on child abuse and neglect. I would also like to thank the organizations which brought this issue to my attention and encouraged the formation of the Working Group--the National Association of Social Workers, National Child Abuse Coalition, Institute for the Advancement of Social Work Research, and the American Psychological Society. 
The Working Group has developed a bold plan for advancing research on child abuse and neglect, as evidenced by the April, 1997 report. This plan will make the optimal use of federal dollars though better coordination of NIH research activities and dissemination of research results to those who can make a difference in children's lives.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation with Senator Rockefeller that will ensure that health insurance policies cover at least $10 million in lifetime benefits. This bill, the Lifetime Caps Discrimination Prevention Act, will help fulfill the promise of real health security and is an appropriate sequel to last year's Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform legislation. Through our reform legislation, families can be spared the loss of their health insurance when they need it the most. 
All of us are at risk of incurring high-cost injuries or illnesses--the very kind of situations that most people want covered by their health insurance polices. A $1 million cap was adequate when it was established by the insurance industry in the early 1970's. Since then, however, inflation has sent medical costs skyrocketing, and today, thousands of Americans have hit their payment ceiling. A majority of those who exceed their lifetime limits must turn to public assistance. While waiting for a determination of eligibility, many individuals are forced to go without medical treatment. This legislation would keep within the private sector those who most need health coverage and would keep them off Medicaid. 
Most of us assume that our health insurance will be there when we need it most--when we are very sick. Unfortunately, many people do not read the fine print in their insurance policies. The average lifetime cost of care for a person who has a spinal cord injury and is ventilator dependent--just like Christopher Reeve--is over $5 million. For someone like Jim Brady, who had a severe head trauma injury, the average cost is about $4 million, and that is in 1990 dollars. As Christopher Reeve said, `I didn't think it could happen to Superman.' 
The Lifetime Caps Discrimination Prevention Act fulfills a promise of real health security by raising the lifetime cap from the typical limit of $1 million--a dollar figure selected in the 1970's--to $5 million in 1998, and then in 2002 to $10 million, which is the real dollar equivalent today. Currently, the vast majority of health maintenance organizations and approximately one-quarter of employer-sponsored health plans have no aggregate lifetime limit. The Federal Employee Health Benefit plans removed lifetime maximums in 1995. According to a Price Waterhouse study, employers with a workforce of 250 employees would experience a mere 1 percent increase in premiums. This is a small price to pay for real health insurance security for people covered in the group market. Our legislation excludes employers with fewer than 20 employees. 
The Lifetime Caps Discrimination Prevention Act was originally introduced as an amendment to the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance legislation passed during the 104th Congress. The amendment enjoyed strong bipartisan support, but it was defeated due to the strategy of opposing amendments to that bill. We believe that this legislation is worthy of reintroduction in the 105th Congress, and we are hopeful that it will attract even broader support as another step that can be taken in strengthening Americans' health security. Over 150 national health-related groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the United Cerebral Palsy Association, and the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, have expressed their support for our efforts to increase lifetime limits on health insurance benefits. 
The insurance industry standard of $1 million, adopted in 1970, was right for those times but today is financially unrealistic. Today, the time has come to protect thousands of individuals from suffering the emotional, medical, and financial consequences of exceeding their caps by adopting a new lifetime limit for health insurance coverage.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Snowe to introduce legislation to aid the growth of commerce throughout New England. The Older Industrial Region Rail and Port Access and Modernization Act aims to improve northern New England's aging rail infrastructure and ocean ports to speed delivery of goods and people throughout the region. 
New England was built by the railroads. But in our modern economy, highways have captured a majority of the commerce, supplanting rail. As we reach the end of this century, our region has begun to recognize the importance of railroads, and their vital role in our expanding economy. Efficient highways run north to south in northern New England, but we have no east to west roads sufficient to handle growing trade and commerce. As Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine work together to compete in this global economy, our success is dependent on our mutual efforts to improve access to markets. We will succeed only if modern freight railroads can serve the entire region and through our ports bring goods to market across the Nation and around the world. 
Rail lines throughout northern New England have been neglected for many years. Crumbling rail beds and constricted passage has limited the movement of freight and passenger trains and restricted rail access to deep water ports. Older bridges, deteriorated tracks, inadequate tunnels all contribute to a rail system that fails to fulfill the needs of the three-State area. As a result, commerce throughout the region suffers. 
A recent report by Cambridge Systematics, entitled `New England Transportation Initiative,' indicates that northern New England's economy cannot fully expand without a carefully planned and implemented intermodal strategy. The study predicts that Maine's ports will gradually lose business to southern ports, primarily in New Jersey and New York, because of inadequate rail transportation and port access. In addition, the study predicts that business and jobs in New Hampshire and Vermont will not keep pace with other regions without a better strategy to efficiently move goods and people. 
An exhaustive analysis by the Eastern Border Transportation Coalition regarding the trade and traffic flows across the eastern United States-Canada border projected a trade increase of close to 200 percent by the year 2015. The report also outlines that this increase could be hampered by a lack of adequate transportation options and overcrowded roads and highway border stations. To avoid this setback, rail options must be available. Without proper infrastructure development, New England's chance to take advantage of such economic growth will diminish. 
The legislation we introduce today will authorize Federal spending to rehabilitate rail 
beds in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire, enabling them to improve their freight rail traffic and better handle the movement of goods and people with their borders. States will be able to apply separately to the U.S. Secretary of Transportation for individual grants. Grant funding is provided for a variety of categories: Port development and access; bridge and tunnel obstruction repair and replacement; repair of railroad beds; and development of intermodal facilities, including intermodal truck-train transfer facilities. Revitalization of these resources will allow freight and passenger trains to move freely throughout the region, reconnecting railroad towns long separated by the hazards of unpassable tracks. 
The bill also establishes a loan assistant program. Railroad companies in Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire will be able to access low interest loans to improve their rail lines in the region. The loans can be used for purchase of rolling stock, development of maintenance facilities, and many other capital improvements. 
Without this legislation, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine may fail to benefit from future growth opportunities. Even though international shipping trade is expected to increase by 20 percent in the next 5 years, New England is less likely to benefit from the influx of business and jobs because of its decaying rail and port infrastructure. Improving rail lines will bring new life to our region, strengthening our industries and thereby our economies. 
Mr. President, I would urge action on this legislation, because, as we are learning, ports and railroads are the life lines that will help to ensure the well-being of all of northern New England.

Mr. JEFFORDS. The bill itself has been ready for about a month and has been under examination for a month. In order to be able to proceed most efficiently and effectively in the amendment process, we have been working with Members--and you have asked us to do so today--to take into consideration possible changes in the bill. We had many requests of that nature over the past month, and we have accommodated, to my knowledge, every one of those requests and have been and are ready to proceed, with the understanding that certain amendments would be offered. Some of those amendments would be accepted and some of those would be disagreed with. 
But we are under the exigencies of time here. This is such an important bill. We started negotiations, the Senate did, last year, under Senator Kassebaum. The bill was voted out of the committee by a very substantial vote. However, there were strong objections raised to it and problems with the House. So we started again this year with the bill and we have been working for several months, now, ironing out these difficulties and problems. 
It was my understanding we had a consensus. That is why we are here on the floor this afternoon. On the other hand, now we understand that some others have reasons that they would like to participate. We have no problem with that. The problem is not ours, in the sense of the committee. The problem is time on the floor. We have just 1 week left before we go into recess in order to accomplish the major bills, the reconciliation and budget matters, and we will have only a limited amount of time. So, for us to proceed and get this finished by the end of the week, which is important, it is going to take agreement by those who now want to participate in order to have a timely process where we can bring this to conclusion. 
I look forward to working with my colleague--I know he will cooperate with us so that this very important piece of legislation can get passed out. The House is waiting to move until we move. Also connected with it is the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, PDUFA, which is very important to get passed because that expires at the end of September. So we must move ahead. I thank the Senator for giving his time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we have just discussed, I am going to proceed so that my colleagues and those interested in this legislation can better understand the nature of this legislation and the importance of it, and, hopefully, later in the day, we will be able to proceed in an orderly manner through the amendment process. 
The legislation is to modernize the Food and Drug Administration, and we authorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which will, upon enactment, streamline the FDA's regulatory procedures. This modernization will help the agency review medical devices and drugs more expeditiously and will let the American public have access sooner to newer, safer and more effective therapeutic products. 
I am disappointed that some of my Democratic colleagues are not desirous of proceeding at this time, but I will do my best to accommodate them and also to move forward on this bill. I am especially chagrined, given the months of bipartisan negotiating that has led to this bill. Each major provision--all of the drugs and medical device provisions of this measure--represents long-sought agreements with the minority and with the FDA itself. I do not understand this continued delay. 
In particular, Senator Kennedy has played a key role in reaching this agreement, and I wish to applaud his willingness and tenacity in working through several difficult issues to reach a consensus on this legislation. 
In addition, Secretary Shalala and the FDA itself has worked diligently to reach reasonable, sensible agreements. This is a good, bipartisan measure that represents moderate yet real reform. It has been agreed to by the minority and the administration. 
There is no reason for further delay, and I am going forward today with the expectation that before the end of the day, we will be moving forward on this bill. 
On June 11, prior to the committee markup of S. 830, I 
received a letter from Secretary Shalala outlining the Department's key concerns. This was sometime ago. In her letter, the Secretary stated: 
I am concerned that the inclusion of nonconsensus issues in the committee's bill will result in a protracted and contentious debate. 
Before and since our committee markup, we have worked hard to achieve a consensus bill. The measure before us today accomplishes that goal. Bipartisan staff and Members have worked diligently with the agency to address each of the significant nonconsensus provisions raised by the Secretary. 
In her letter, Secretary Shalala expressed her feeling that the legislation would lower the review standard for marketing approval. Key changes have been made to the substitute to address these concerns. With respect to the number of clinical investigations required for approval, changes were made to assure that there is not a presumption of less than the two well-controlled and adequate investigations, while guarding against the rote requirement of two studies. 
We made it very clear you don't have to do two, although it is quite acceptable for you to do two, but you shouldn't look at it as being required. It is not necessary. 
The measure clarifies that substantial evidence may, when the Secretary determines that such data and evidence are sufficient to establish effectiveness, consist of data with one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence. 
Concerns were raised also about allowing distribution of experimental therapies without adequate safeguards to assure patient safety or completion of research on efficacy. Changes to accommodate those concerns were made. They are in the substitute. We tighten the definition of who may provide unapproved therapies and gave FDA more control over the expanded access process. 
Other changes will ensure that use of products outside of clinical trials will not interfere with adequate enrollment of patients in those trials and also give the FDA authority to terminate expanded access if patient safeguard protections are not met. The provision allowing manufacturers to charge for products covered under the expedited access provision was deleted also. 
In mid-June, the Secretary argued that S. 830 would allow health claims for food and economic claims for drugs and biologic products without adequate scientific proof. In response, Senator Gregg agreed to changes that would allow the FDA 120 days to review a health claim and provide the agency with the authority to prevent the claim from being used in the marketplace by issuing an interim final regulation. 
In addition, the provision allowing pharmaceutical manufacturers to distribute economic information was modified to clarify that the information must be based on competent and reliable scientific evidence and limited the scope to claims directly related to an indication for which the drug was approved. 
This bill was further changed to accommodate the Secretary's opposition to the provision that would allow third-party review for devices. 
Products now excluded from third-party review include Class III products. These are products that are implantable for more than 1 year, those that are life sustaining or life supporting, and also products that are of substantial importance in the prevention of impairment to human health. 
In addition, a provision advocated by Senator Harkin has been incorporated that clarifies the statutory right of the FDA to review records related to compensation agreements between accredited reviewers and device sponsors. 
I want to point out that we have been working hard with Members, the Secretary, and others who brought problems to us, and we believe we have all of those taken care of, but we understand now we will have to do some more work today. 
Finally, the Secretary was concerned about provisions that she felt would burden the agency with extensive new regulatory requirements that would detract resources from critical agency functions without commensurate enhancement of the public health. This legislation now gives FDA new powers to make enforcement activity more efficient, adds important new patient benefits and protections, and makes the review process more efficient. 
First, we give FDA new powers and clarify existing authority, including mandatory foreign facility registration, seizure authority for certain imported goods, and a presumption of interstate commerce for FDA-regulated products. Those are all important changes to help clarify the powers of the FDA. 
Second, to assist patients with finding out about promising new clinical trials, we established a clinical trials database registry, accessed by an 800 number. Patients will also benefit from a new requirement that companies report annually on their compliance with agreements to conduct postapproval studies on drugs. This was an important provision that we added, working with Senator Kennedy. 
Third, FDA's burden will be eased by provisions to make the review process more collaborative. Collaborative reviews will improve the quality of applications for new products and reduce the length of time and effort required to review products. We also expressly allow FDA to access expertise at other science-based agencies and contract with experts to help with product reviews. This is very important to bring about more efficient and effective utilization of resources. 
Lastly, by expanding the third-party review pilot program for medical devices, we build on an important tool for the agency to use in managing an increasing workload in an era of declining Federal resources. 
In closing, I echo another part of Secretary Shalala's June 11 letter:  
I want to commend you and the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle on the progress we have made together to develop a package of sensible, consensus reform provisions that are ready for consideration with reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. . . a protracted and contentious debate . . . would not serve our mutual goal of timely reauthorization of PDUFA and passage of constructive, consensus bipartisan FDA reform. 
I can't tell you how pleased I am that we have been able to work with the Secretary and come to this point now where we have few--I don't believe we have any disagreements--with the Secretary. Although we have some further matters we may have to discuss. 
From the beginning of this process, all of the stakeholders have been committed to producing a consensus measure, and we have accomplished that goal. There is agreement on this bill, and I urge my Democratic colleagues to allow this important measure to move forward. 
Before yielding the floor, I would like to commend the members of the committee. I have never worked with a group that has worked as hard as the members of my committee have to bring about a consensus. This has been night-and-day work for weeks. We have some outstanding Members on both sides of the aisle that have done outstanding work to bring us to this point. I could name them all, and I will eventually as we go forward, but I know standing and ready to go is one of those who has been of invaluable service to this committee. That is Senator Frist. With his knowledge as a physician, his intelligence and ability to communicate in a way that brings about consensus, we have moved forward on some incredibly important goals for being able to assist our doctors in their pursuance of good health for all of us. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the Senator from Oregon for his support and for his very effective presentation. I know there are so many of us here who want to work together. In fact, just about everybody does. That is why it is of such concern to me that we now find ourselves in a position where we can't proceed. I know of the Senator's immense assistance in helping us in this matter, and I appreciate what he has said. 
Mr. President, I think it would be wise at this point, while we are biding time in the hopes of being able to move forward, to answer the questions that many people have: Why are we here? What is the big deal? What is so important? Why are we anxious to get moving and to get this piece of legislation passed? 
I would like to go through some of the problems that we have right now with the FDA because it is our lives and our health that are at stake here. The time delays that occur because of the various problems at the FDA that we are trying to correct mean that new therapies that would be essential to your life and health, proceed so slowly that many, many people are deprived of the hopes and dreams we all have of a good health and a good life. 
Let me provide some examples. By law, FDA is required to review and act on applications for approval on drugs within 180 days. Now, that 180 days was not just pulled out of the air. That was looking at the normal processes you would be able to do it in 180 days. According to FDA's own budget justification for fiscal year 1998, it takes the agency an average of 12 months longer than the statute allows to complete this process. It takes, on average, a year and a half for a process that should take 6 months. 
Since the 1960's to the 1990's, complete clinical trials, that is, the time required by FDA to show for efficacy of drugs, has increased from 2.5 to nearly 7 years. Between 1990 and 1995, the FDA average approval time, that is, the time after the clinical trials have been completed, was about 2.3 years. 
Today, only 1 in 5,000 potential new medicines is ever approved by the FDA. According to a recently published study, from the beginning of the process to the end, it takes an average of 15 years and costs in the range of $500 million to bring a new drug to market. 
Why does this process take so long? Before FDA even gets involved in the process, innovators spend an average of 6 1/2 years in early research and preclinical testing in the laboratory and with animal studies. Long before human tests begin, a summary of all the preclinical results is submitted to the FDA. This document, known as the investigational new drug application, or IND, contains information on chemistry, manufacturing data, pharmacological test results, safety testing results and a plan for clinical testing in people. 
If the FDA judges the potential benefits to humans to outweigh the risks involved, the stage is set for three phases of clinical trials to begin. Taken together, the three phases of clinical trials in human populations average about an additional 6 years. 
Phase I clinical trials focus on safety. During about a 1-year period, very low doses of compound are administered to small groups of healthy volunteers. Gradually, they are increased to determine how the bodies react to the different levels. 
Phase II clinical trials last about 2 years; that is, 2 additional years. They involve 100 and 300 patient volunteers, and focus on the compounds effectiveness. These are blinded trials that are held in hospitals around the country where they compare the innovator compound with a so called placebo--that is the control group is not given anything. The effect of the innovator drug is compared with effect on those who received the placebo. Three out of four prospective drugs drop out of the picture as a result of the data collected during these phase II trials. 
Phase III trials involve one or more clinical trials where researchers aim to confirm the results of earlier tests in a larger population. Phase III lasts from 2 to 5 years and can involve between 3,000 and 150,000 patients in hundreds of hospitals and medical centers. These tests provide researchers with a huge database of information on the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate to satisfy FDA's regulatory requirements. 
The amount of data required to file for the next new phase, new drug application, or NDA, is staggering. The application for new drugs typically runs to hundreds of thousands of pages in length. For example, in 1994, the NDA for a groundbreaking arthritis medication contained more than 1,000 volumes of documentation that weighed 3 tons. It included data from clinical tests in roughly 10,000 patients, some of whom had been taking new medication 5 years. 
During the NDA review process--which can last an additional 2 1/2 years, Government officials have extensive contact with the company. They visit the research facilities and talk to the doctors and scientists involved in the research. In addition, FDA officials visit and approve the manufacturing facilities and review and approve all the labeling, packaging and marketing that will accompany the product. 
Well, that is good and we want the FDA to be thorough, but things can be done more efficiently and more effectively. If we 
cannot reduce these times based on the consensus agreements in this bill--then a lot of people will lose the timely availability and the utilization of these breakthroughs. 
What does this reducing of overall time mean for Americans? If we can reduce this overall time, it means quicker access to safe and effective lifesaving drugs. 
I want to point out that the FDA, when it reviewed priority applications, has been able to make breakthroughs in AIDS and elsewhere by just being more efficient. 
Also, for instance, to give you an example of review process delay, over 12 million type-2 diabetics had to wait almost 2 years for a new machine to be approved. Almost 2 million American women with breast cancer had to wait almost 2 years in excess of what should have been required for this review process. 
So when that you have that kind of delay, you know you have to have reform, and that is why we are here. Some may argue that the long period of review and approval time is the price we pay for ensuring drug safety and efficacy. But that long delay does not hold true for all drugs. We know the FDA can significantly reduce its approval times because it has already done it. We have, for instance, with respect to the AIDS therapies, the so-called protease inhibiters that were approved in a matter of months. FDA can do more to ensure that they receive timely attention, and S. 830 will help FDA do so for all promising therapies. FDA is aware of this, and that is why they have been working to help simplify the law, simplify the process, simplify the procedures, so that we can get these drugs to market on time without in any way infringing upon the necessity to protect the health of our people. 
So as we proceed, I will review these issues in a more definitive manner. But as we await removal of an objection to proceed, I just wanted to remind people that there are real, valid, deep concerns that we are facing here. Our goal is to make sure the health of our Nation can improve and that people will be able to have access to the innovative therapies that will benefit their lives. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I, again, want to thank Doctor --Senator Frist who is a cosponsor of this bill and has lent his incredible expertise to this effort. I especially thank him for his leadership, with Senators Mack, Boxer, and Wyden, for their work in solving the off-labeling provision. Their collaboration shows the broad base of support this provision now has. Off-labeling was one of the most contentious provisions in the last Congress. To come up with a solution of that issue is a tremendous step forward. I want to talk a little bit, before I wind things up here, about the broad base of support we have. 
Senator DeWine, for instance, joined with Senator Dodd in offering important amendments to establish incentives for the conduct of research into pediatric uses of existing and new drugs. 
Senator Hutchinson had an amendment to establish a national framework for pharmacy compounding with respect to State regulations which allowed us to move forward on another very contentious and important issue. 
I also want to praise and thank Senator Mikulski for being a cosponsor of this legislation, and the importance of her help on PDUFA, of which she was a primary sponsor. We all benefit from Senator Mikulski's determination to bring FDA into the 21st century, not just for the benefit of her own constituents, but for all of us. 
I also would like to point out that we had contributions by Senator Dodd in the area of patient databases. He worked very closely with Senator Snowe and Senator Feinstein. We are grateful for their leadership in these areas. Senator Dodd has been a tremendous asset in helping to enact broad-based reform this year. He has been of steady, continual assistance to us. 
Also, the tremendous difficulties that we had with third-party review provisions during the last Congress have undergone substantial revision since it was first debated. Senator Coats in particular has shown incredible leadership on this issue. This was a very difficult area and Senator Coats has been magnanimous in his willingness to spend many hours in bringing about consensus. I certainly appreciate his work. 
Senator Wellstone's contributions to the area of reforming medical device reviews shows the breadth of the philosophical collaboration we had on these issues. Senator Wellstone introduced his own legislation to reform the medical devices approval process and many of his provisions are included in this bill. 
Also, of course, Senator Kennedy has been of incredible help, as he has been on so many issues. He has worked hard and I thank him for the number of hours that he and his staff put into this bill to make sure we arrived at a consensus. 
I also thank Senator Gregg for working so hard on radio-pharmaceuticals, on streamlining the process for reviewing health claims based on Federal research, and on establishing uniformity in over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. The latter issue--cosmetic uniformity--is still giving us some trouble. 
But Senator Gregg has just been incredibly hard-working and effective with this bill in handling four different issues. 
Also, the two amendments that Senator Harkin had on the third-party review for medical devices and also his work in other areas has been a very great help and a demonstration of the broad philosophical support that we have and how we are working together to bring about a consensus, hopefully, before the end of the day on the remaining issues. 
Mr. President, before I cease, I would like to take care of a couple of housekeeping matters here.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would be happy to enlighten the body as to where we stand. It is my understanding we have an agreement. However, it appears an objection will be raised if we try to move forward at this time. So, I would just alert everyone that I believe we have an agreement and that we will be able to move forward this week. 
There are, as is always the case when you go to bring a measure forward, people who decide suddenly they want to be involved in the process. We will try to accommodate them. I know there are several Members who are out of the country right now and will be back later today. So, I don't intend to call up the FDA Act at this time, but I will, with the indulgence of the President, move forward, I suppose as in morning business, and discuss where we are on the bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today, pursuant to many recent discussions about the rescue plan for the District of Columbia, that reaffirms my strong belief that education must be the keystone of that plan and that fair and ready funding is available with no cost to the Federal Government. 
Every Washington area citizen should keep a careful watch on what Congress is doing to rescue the Capital from its present plight. The chorus resounds, `we must get people to move back into the Capital! Its future depends on it!' But if we examine the present congressional and administration plans and overlay them onto the root causes for the plight, serious questions arise as to their effectiveness. 
Studies indicate that the two leading causes, by far, that cause people to leave the District and keep them from living in the city are poor schools and high incidents of crime. Let's examine the plans that Congress has before it. 
Only the Senate plan as currently outlined even mentions education and that is basically a symbolic gesture to help repair the crumbling school infrastructure. The administration does consider the crime problem, but only at the end game of taking over the prison system. The administration's plan has no mention of repairing the failing D.C. educational system; a system which is among the worst in the Nation. 
The central administrative problem of the District's school system is not money, it is management chaos. But money is a serious concern in the area of school infrastructure, and D.C. has one of the worst school infrastructures in the Nation. In fairness to General Becton, the new chief executive officer for the schools, he is trying valiantly to upgrade overall standards but too much of his time is spent dealing with emergency school infrastructure repairs. Again this September, 43 schools will be threatened with closure at the outset of the academic year. Over $2 billion are needed just to fix building code violations. 
Crime in the District is directly related to the public school system. Some 40 percent of D.C. children drop out of school between grades 7 and 12. National studies show that about 80 percent of prison inmates are school drop-outs. A plan to help D.C. must have a strong component to improve education. As will be shown below, this need not carry a significant dollar cost to the Federal Treasury. In fact it will save millions. 
The President wants to be known as the Education President. Congress wants to be known as the Education Congress. Wouldn't the best demonstration of that intent be to start by improving the education system of the Nation's Capital? 
The present plans for enhancing a middle-class tax base in the District are based on business tax incentives. But if you are a middle-class taxpayer with school-age children you currently have to factor in approximately $10,000 a year in private education fees to feel comfortable with the level of education and safety you are providing to your family--$10,000 a year, per child, is a huge barrier for most middle-class families. 
The plans currently being considered in Congress that exclude discussion of schools may well create jobs. But jobs for whom? Even the promoters of those plans recognize that those jobs would primarily go to non-residents of the District. Projections show that two out of three jobs will go to non-residents. This will leave the District with more infrastructure demands and less money to deal with them--the exact status of the problems at present. 
As stated in the recent Brookings Institution study on D.C. entitled `The Orphan Capital' taxing metropolitan area residents where they live instead of where they work creates a revenue boon for Maryland and Virginia and a revenue disaster for the District. D.C. is the only city in a multi-State configuration in the country that has an income tax but is not able to tax its non-resident workers. This situation has also led D.C. to have the highest income tax rate on its residents in the area. That income tax rate is another barrier to the middle-class return to the city. 
The result is that $20 billion in wages leaves the District each year without being taxed, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars flowing each year to the treasuries of Maryland and Virginia. Only 1 percent of this amount goes in the other direction--from D.C. residents working in the suburbs back in to D.C. This is a huge inequity that no other major city suffers. 
The history of the tax inequity began in 1973 when D.C. was given home rule. An astute Virginia representative convinced Congress to prohibit the non-resident tax from being enacted. A brilliant move, perhaps justified at the time, but it is unjust now, particularly to the children of D.C. It is not unexpected that the Maryland and Virginia Senators object violently when changing this situation is suggested. 
However, a win-win proposal for all D.C. metropolitan residents is possible. It will create high-paying job opportunities for high-school graduates through improved skill training. It will provide the needed repairs to the D.C. school infrastructure. It will provide funds to improve schools and other area training institutions. 
A recent report issued by the Greater Washington Board of Trade indicates that there are approximately 50,000 high-paying jobs requiring information technology skills in the Washington metropolitan area. These jobs pay on average $40,000 a year. By filling these jobs the Board of Trade estimates an additional $3.5 billion annually would be injected into the economy of what we call `the golden crescent'--the Washington metropolitan region that stretches from Annapolis, Maryland to Winchester, Virginia. 
But actually, this labor market shortage is a national problem. There are an estimated 190,000 information technology jobs going begging in the Nation for lack of skilled workers. Congress is presently trying to pass legislation to revamp our workforce training laws. We have at this time a prime opportunity to solve the D.C. metropolitan problem and provide a national model to help correct the serious national skill training deficiencies. I am introducing legislation today to accomplish this `win-win' structure. 
If the Washington metropolitan area were to become a model for the rest of the country we could jump start the rest of the country in solving this serious national problem. And this could be done with no additional Federal cost. But, of course, there is a hitch. 
My plan would require a 3-percent non-resident income tax on D.C. commuter wages. But remember, it would cost the commuters nothing because of laws requiring mutual offsetting tax credits. There would be an offset against the State income taxes of Maryland and Virginia. This would allow the commuter dollars to stay within the metropolitan region instead of going to Richmond and Annapolis with the hope of it coming back. 
One percent of this new revenue would be used to repair the D.C. school infrastructure. Bonds could then be amortized for the $2 billion needed. The other two percent would fund a trust overseen by metro-area school and business leaders to provide funding for regional skill training. 
Benefits to the regional economy should more than offset any losses to the States. It is hard to argue against growing the local Maryland and Virginia metro-area economies by $3.5 billion a year. This and future gains would more than offset the 1 percent going solely to D.C. 
And finally, this bill results in hundreds of millions of dollars in savings to the Federal Government; hundreds of millions of dollars of help to the suburbs surrounding the capital; the repair of the D.C. school system and the overall improvement of the regional school system; and potential revenue gains to Maryland and Virginia. Most importantly, it would make the congressional and administration plans sensible instead of senseless. We must not miss this opportunity.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with Senator Cochran regarding the status of legislation to modernize the Food and Drug Administration and reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 [PDUFA]. The Labor Committee has reported out S. 830 with a strong bipartisan vote of 14-4. This legislation reauthorizes PDUFA for 5 years and brings the Agency's procedures up to date with the tremendous innovation now occurring in the health technology sector. It is my understanding that the bill before us does not reauthorize or extend the PDUFA program and appropriately leaves this action to the Labor Committee and the Congress. The bill before us does anticipate this reauthorization of PDUFA by setting a limit on the amount of fees which may be collected and expended once the reauthorization is enacted--which is a sensible approach. FDA reform and reauthorization of PDUFA go hand-in-hand and I am fully confident that we will have legislation accomplishing both at once on the floor in a timely fashion.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, with my colleagues Senators Kennedy, Frist, and Collins, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1997. Our legislation authorizes the National Science Foundation [NSF] for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and is similar to the legislation that was approved by the House of Representatives by voice vote on April 24, 1997. 
The strong bipartisan support which NSF enjoys is a product of its historic contribution to American security and competitiveness. The prominent role of science in the American war effort during World War II left Americans with a new appreciation of the importance of research in establishing and preserving economic and military security. Federally funded research provided the American war effort with radar, sonar, the proximity fuse, blood plasma, sulfanilamide, penicillin, and the atomic bomb. In 1944, President Roosevelt charged Vannevar Bush, his chief science adviser, with evaluating the most effective way to harness this technological infrastructure in peace-time. The Bush report--Science--The Endless Frontier--established a strategy and rationale for Federal support of basic research. The report argued that `a nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific knowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its competitive position in world trade regardless of its mechanical skill.' This report provided the blueprint for creation of the National Science Foundation. 
NSF was established in 1950 to `develop and encourage the pursuit of a national policy for the promotion of basic research and education in the sciences.' Eight years later, following the 1957 Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite, this mission was expanded to provide greater support for science education and literacy. Over the next three decades, NSF became the primary Federal sponsor of basic scientific research in mathematics, physical sciences, computer science, engineering, and environmental science at colleges and universities. Equally important to the future of our Nation, NSF has become a primary catalyst for math and science education reform. 
NSF'S ROLE IN FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
The legislation which I am introducing with my colleagues authorizes $3.5 billion for the National Science Foundation in fiscal year 1998 and $3.6 billion in fiscal year 1999. Although the National Science Foundation's budget accounts for only 4 percent of Federal research and development funding, NSF provides 25 percent of Federal support to academic institutions for research. NSF's contribution is even greater in some disciplines--NSF provides nearly 50 percent of all Federal support for basic research in certain fields of science, including math, computer science, and environmental science. This funding supports approximately 19,000 research and education projects at more than 2,000 colleges, universities, primary, elementary, and secondary schools, businesses, and other research institutions. Competition for these grants is fierce. NSF funds only about one-third of the 30,000 proposals it reviews annually. 
The importance of this investment cannot be exaggerated. Over the past decade, private sector investment in research and development has eclipsed Federal investment in public science. However, the Federal investment in basic science plays a preeminent role in industrial innovation in the United States. A recent review of American industrial patent applications revealed that the Government or nonprofit foundations supported 75 percent of the main papers cited as the foundation for the new industrial innovation. The remaining 25 percent were funded by industry. 
NSF'S ROLE IN SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY LITERACY 
This bill authorizes $645 million for the education and human resources directorate [EHRD] in fiscal year 1998. EHRD has primary responsibility for NSF's education and training activities. In contrast with the programs of the Department of Education, NSF science and math education programs are experiments which link learning and discovery. Proposals are selected by outside peer review panels on the basis of their potential to provide long-lasting and broad impact. NSF has made notable contributions in the areas of curriculum and instructional material development, professional development, and improved the participation in science research and science education of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities. This legislation strengthens and enhances these efforts. 
And finally, I would be remiss if I did not speak about the partnership which has been forged between the State of Vermont and the National Science Foundation. Last year, NSF grants were provided to the Barre Town Elementary School, Mountshire Museum of Science, Cabot School, Charlestown Elementary School, St. Michael's College, Johnson State College, and the University of Vermont. In 1992, the Vermont Institute for Science, Math, and Technology received a 5-year award of $7.9 million to establish a collaborative statewide education reform effort linking business, higher education, government, and community sectors. 
Our bill builds upon partnerships like that forged with the State of Vermont and offers a credible bipartisan response to the research and science education challenges facing our Nation. I urge the support of all my colleagues in the Senate for this worthwhile legislation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself, Senator Murray, and Senator Snowe, to introduce the James P. Grant World Summit for Children Implementation Act of 1997. 
At the 1990 World Summit for Children, the United States and 158 other nations made a promise to the world's children. In signing the summit declaration and plan of action, they pledged, by the year 2000, to reduce child mortality rates by at least one-third, to reduce maternal deaths and child malnutrition by one-half, to provide all children access to basic education, and to provide all families access to clean water, safe sanitation and family planning information, and services. In the declaration they stated, `We are prepared to make available the resources to meet these commitments.' 
We have, in fact, made some progress over the last several years in meeting these admittedly ambitious objectives. Child mortality rates have fallen. Over 80 percent of the world's children are now immunized, saving 3 million lives annually. Nonetheless, millions of children are still dying every year for want of a vaccine costing just a few dollars or a Vitamin A capsule costing a few cents. It is estimated that 12 million children still die each year from preventable diseases and malnutrition. 
The objective of the legislation Senators Murray and Snowe and I are introducing today is to keep the United States focused on the commitments it made at the World Summit on Children. The bill would shift funds within the existing foreign assistance budget to meet the needs of children--without increasing overall foreign assistance. Specifically, it calls for increased allocations of funds for child survival, basic education, Vitamin A and other micronutrients, UNICEF, AIDS prevention and care, refugee assistance, family planning, and tuberculosis prevention and treatment. 
This is not just a foreign assistance bill. We can and must do more in our own country to improve the health and welfare of children at risk. Therefore, this legislation also calls for increased funding of domestic programs which touch the lives of children, namely Head Start and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as WIC. Both of these programs have proven track records of improving the lives and prospects of children from low-income families. 
Mr. President, I appreciate that Congress is in the midst of serious fiscal belt tightening in order to meet our balanced budget objectives. This means that we must focus on our highest priorities. I would maintain, though, that we have no higher priority than our children and providing for their future. The programs cited in this bill, if properly funded, will improve the quality of life of children, here and abroad, and help them grow into healthy, productive adults. Moreover, it will do so without increasing our overall foreign assistance and with only a modest increase in the two domestic programs cited. 
Mr. President, this bill is good for children, good for their families, and good for our future. I urge my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an American and Austrian hero, Baron Georg von Trapp, on the 50th anniversary of his death. During his lifetime, Baron von Trapp stood for honor and courage. He held a deep devotion for both his country and his family. Baron von Trapp was remembered on the week-end of July 11, in a celebration at the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, VT. I regret that I was unable to attend, however I would like to take this opportunity to remember the significance of his life, made famous by the 1965 movie, `The Sound of Music.' 
It is a reflection of Baron von Trapp's spirit that he is not only an American legend, but he is also considered a hero in Austria, the homeland that he fled 60 years ago. It is a tribute to his excellence that the 89 members of the 1997 graduating class of the Theresianum Military Academy, the Austrian equivalent to West Point, voted Baron von Trapp their class hero, someone whom they all wished to emulate. 
Baron von Trapp was a celebrated military commander. He was honored with two medals for courage in battle, including the Maria Theresian Ritter Medal, Austria's highest, for sinking a French submarine in 1915. He was also influential in the development of submarine warfare and torpedoes. However, his love and devotion for his country never underscored the importance of his family. He made an intense connection with his children through music. Out of this connection came the famous Trapp Family Singers. When the Nazis invaded and were pressuring Baron von Trapp to join Hitler's ranks, he asked his family if they wanted to leave for America, saying that if anyone wanted to stay, they would all stay. Everyone wanted to leave. 
Although nothing could replace the love he had for his homeland, Baron von Trapp did grow to love his new home in Vermont. He found new passions in maple sugaring and farming. Because they spent most of the year touring, they rented out rooms in their lodge to skiers, starting what would eventually become a landmark in Vermont, the Trapp Family Lodge. 
Once again, I would like to express my admiration for Baron von Trapp and his entire family on the anniversary of his death.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Vermont State Police on the occasion of their 50th anniversary. 
It all started on July 1, 1947, when the Department of Public Safety, home of the Vermont State Police, was established by the Vermont General Assembly. Although Vermont was one of the last in the Nation to create a State police force, it is widely regarded as one of the country's best. At its inception, it was comprised of 55 State troopers and 7 civilians. 
During the department's 50 years of service, Vermont's population has increased by over 50 percent. As Vermont changed, so did the department. Today, it also includes a larger civilian force to assist with laboratory procedures and other non-law enforcement related work. Technological advances such as the introduction of radar as a speed enforcement tool, the purchase of the first polygraph instrument, and the creation of a mobile crime lab unit all increased the department's ability to deal with the rising challenges facing law enforcement today. 
The changing societal and family dynamics have greatly impacted our police force. Today, our troopers must be trained differently to meet these challenges. What remains the same, however, is the dedication, professionalism, and exemplary service we have been accustomed to--in spite of the ever present dangers of the job. On any given day, a trooper's job might range from assisting a stranded motorist on Interstate 89 to a homicide call in the northeast kingdom. 
For 50 years the department has helped improve our communities and given our citizens a sense of security. On behalf of all Vermonters I would like to thank the Department of Public Safety, and wish them continued success.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, there are more than 12 million children under the age of five--including half of all infants under one year of age--who spend at least part of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. There are millions more school-aged children under the age of twelve who are in some form of child care at the beginning and end of the school day as well as during school holidays and vacations. And more six to twelve year olds who are latchkey kids--returning home from school to no supervision because parents are working and there are few, if any, alternatives. 
The past two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the number of women in the paid labor force. Women now constitute 46% of our nation's labor force. Most women are working to meet their family's basic needs. More than 60% of women with pre-school aged children are employed full- or part-time. Their employment is not a choice, but an essential part of their family's economic survival. And for most of these families, child care is not an option, but a requirement. 
Many of the traditional sources of child care are no longer available--as many of the friends, neighbors, grandparents, and other relatives who used to be available to provide child care are also working. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that for parents who must work, child care services that are dependable and of high quality make it easier to find and keep a job. Good child care helps parents reach and maintain economic self-sufficiency. Congress acknowledged this when it passed welfare reform last year, which dramatically increased the amount of entitlement money available for child care. 
Steady increases in the number of employed women with young children, combined with last year's welfare reforms, have placed tremendous pressures on communities to dramatically expand the amount of available child care. While the supply of child care has increased over the past 10 years, there are still significant shortages for parents in rural areas, those with school-aged children or infants, and for lower-income families. 
I think that few of us know how much child care costs. The Senate Employee's Child Care Center costs between $150 and $175 a week--$7,800 to $9,100 a year. That places it in the high-middle range in terms of costs for the Washington, D.C. area. The younger the child, the higher the costs--and Senate Employee's Child Care Center does not accept children under 18 months old, the most expensive type of child care. 
The costs of child care are almost wholly dependent upon the geographic area, the type of child care, and the age of the child. For example, a family purchasing full-time child care services for a four-year-old in rural New York using a family child care home may pay as little as $60 a week. In contrast, a family with an infant using a child care center in New York City may pay more than $250 a week. 
For a 3- to 4-year-old child, the least expensive age group, the national average for center-based child care is $4,600 a year. The average cost for high quality care, such as that provided by the Senate Employee's Child Care Center, is between $8,500 and $9,100 a year. The cost of family-based child care is generally less expensive, while in-home care with a nanny or au pair is generally more expensive. 
A family normally spends about twenty-percent of its income on housing and ten-percent on food. The costs of child care for a low-or middle-income family can rival the cost of housing and be double the cost of food. Even though most of us recognize the critical part that child care plays in the economic survival of families, we often fail to recognize it as a basic cost which consumes a significant portion of a family's income. 
Parents can only purchase child care they can afford. Those who do find care that is affordable and convenient are often unsatisfied with the quality of the care their child receives. In fact, one quarter of all parents would change their child care arrangement if they could find and afford something better. 
Since 1990, the costs of child care have risen about six-percent annually. This is almost triple the annual increase in the cost of living. At the same time, there are strong indicators that the quality of child care has significantly decreased during that same period of time. Parents are paying more but getting less. 
The quality of child care in America is very troubling. A recent nationwide study found that forty-percent of the child care provided to infants in child care centers was potentially injurious. Fifteen-percent of center-based child care providers for all pre-schoolers are so bad that a child's health and safety are threatened; seventy-percent are mediocre--not hurting or helping children; and fifteen-percent actively promote a child's development. Center-based child care, the object of this study, is the most heavily regulated and frequently monitored type of child care. There are strong indications that care for children in less regulated settings, such as family-based child care and in-home care, is far worse. 
Combining the research on the quality of child care with the breakthroughs on the development of the human brain produces a very disturbing situation. Many children enter child care by eleven weeks of age, are in care for close to 30 hours a week, and often stay in some form of child care until they enter school. During that same period of life, a child's brain is undergoing a series of extraordinary changes. 
In the first three years of life, the brain either makes the connections it needs for learning or it atrophies, making later efforts at remediation in learning, behavior, and thinking difficult, at best. The experiences and stimulation that a caretaker provide to a child are the foundations upon which all future learning is built. The brain's greatest and most critical growth spurt is between birth and ten years of age--precisely the time when non-parental child care is most frequently utilized. A Time magazine special report on `How a Child's Brain Develops' (February 3, 1997) said it best, `. . . Good, affordable day care is not a luxury or a fringe benefit for welfare mothers and working parents but essential brain food for the next generation.' While bad child care can seriously impair a child's development, high-quality child care significantly increases the chances of good developmental outcomes for children. 
Think about it. At the most important time in the development of a child's brain, more than twelve million children are being cared for by people who are paid less than the person who picks up your garbage each week, and are required to have less training than the person who cuts your hair, and less skill-based testing than the person delivering packages to your house. Child care providers play an important role in a child's development, for they help fine-tune the child's capacity to think and process information, social skills, emotional health, and acquisition of language. 
Last year, our goal in child care was to streamline federal assistance by creating a cohesive structure for federal assistance and to provide sufficient government funds to subsidize child care for welfare recipients who were transitioning into work. This year our goal must be to promote the healthy development of children in child care. I am worried that the pressure of the need to accommodate the increasing demand for child care will force many into forgoing quality just to increase the number of child care slots available. 
I rise today to introduce legislation entitled `Creating Improved Delivery of Child Care: Affordable, Reliable, and Educational Act of 1997,' the CIDCARE Act. It incorporates modifications to the tax code, an incentive grant program for states (including wage subsidies for child care providers who get additional training and education and a grant program to encourage small business partnerships to provide child care for employees), a technology-based infrastructure for the professional development of child care providers, educational loan forgiveness for child care providers, requirements that states include the cost of child care in the calculation of child support orders, expansion of the federal government's technical assistance and information dissemination role, and requirements that child care centers located in federal facilities to meet high quality standards of care. 
There is no one thing--no magic bullet--that will ensure higher quality child care. Each of these provisions has been included to solve a specific problem or break through a barrier that has hampered efforts to improve the quality of child care. Taken as a whole, these provisions represent a comprehensive effort to increase the supply 
while simultaneously creating a demand for high-quality child care, and make it affordable for low- and middle-income families. 
To offset the cost of these changes, the bill reduces, but does not eliminate, the dependent care tax credit for upper income taxpayers. Over a 5-year period, it gradually decreases the amount that an employee can place in a dependent care assistance plan used to reimburse nonaccredited or non-credential child care. In addition, the legislation expands the coordinated enforcement efforts of the Internal Revenue Service and the HHS Office of Child Support Enforcement, which will significantly reduce the amount of fraud related to illegal tax deduction and credit claims by noncustodial, noncontributing parents. 
The first provision in CIDCARE makes several changes in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit [CDCTC]. This tax credit is the largest tax-based subsidy for child care. The bill raises the income level for the receipt of the highest percentage of employment-related child care costs from $10,000 to $20,000. The percentage is decreased at a rate of 1 percent for each additional $2,500 in adjusted gross income and sets a minimum percentage of 10 percent for incomes of $70,000 and above. 
This change represents a more equitable distribution of limited resources based on the percentage of income a family must use to meet child care expenses. For families qualifying for the EITC, the legislation makes the child care tax credit refundable, on a quarterly basis. This will enable many low-income working families to move from part-time to full-time employment, by easing the burden of child care costs and having the money available at regular intervals throughout the year. 
Another revision to the Child Care Tax Credit establishes, over a 5-year period, different rates for the tax credit, dependent on whether the child care is provided in an accredited child care facility or by a credentialed professional. This will reward parents who choose high-quality child care and help defray the additional costs of that care. 
I am sensitive to the concerns of colleagues who object to reducing the child care tax credit. But before you judge this reduction too harshly, let's put it into perspective. The tax credit remains at or above the current rate of 20 percent for parents with adjusted gross incomes of $45,000 or less, regardless of the type of child care. The median income of families with children nationally is $37,000. While there are wide differences in between States, there are only four States where the median exceeds $45,000 AGI, triggering a reduction in the current rate of 20 percent. The median income in most States is significantly below this trigger. 
At the end of the 5-year phase in period, the tax credit remains at or above the current 20 percent rate for families with an AGI of $55,000--if they choose high-quality child care. No States have median incomes of families with children which exceed this which triggers a reduction below current child care tax rate. Families with incomes at or 
above $70,000 will still receive a tax credit of ten percent, increased to 12.5% if high quality care is used. 
In terms of money, a one percent decrease in the child care tax credit equals $24 when care for one child is claimed, and $48 for two or more children. Families making $70,000 or more are the hardest hit by my legislation. Yet their maximum financial cost is $240 a year for one child,or $480 a year for two or more children--about half of one percent of their adjusted gross income. 
The second area of changes occurs in the Dependent Care Assistance Plan (DCAP). The CIDCARE Act increases the amount that an employee can contribute to a DCAP account, if the funds are used to pay for the care of two or more eligible persons. In addition, the amount of DCAP contributions is increased for high-quality care and decreased for care that is provided by an unaccredited child care facility or a person who has not received a professional credential. At the end of the five year phase in, the maximum decrease in the DCAP amount for unaccredited care is 20% lower than the current ceiling on contributions. These differential rates are phased in over a five year period in order for child care providers to achieve accreditation or become credentialed in child care. 
Current law prohibits DCAP from being used to pay relatives for care. While I support needed controls on the use of DCAP accounts in most cases, my legislation would make a very limited exception to this prohibition. DCAP payments could be made to pay a parent or grandparent to care for a newborn child. The DCAP account could be joined at anytime during a pregnancy. The funds would be available for up to 12 months from the date of deposit into the employee's DCAP account--because babies have a timetable all their own when it comes to being born. 
The last change CIDCARE makes in the Dependent Care Assistance Plan is a requirement that federal employees have the opportunity to contribute to DCAP. Private employees, as well as many state and local governments, have had DCAP available for their employees since 1981. Consistent with the intent of the Congressional Accountability Act, I want to make this child care subsidy available to federal workers, including legislative branch employees. 
Child care is a growing concern to businesses, big and small. Employers are coming to the realization that affordable, convenient high-quality child care is a critical element in hiring and retaining skilled employees. Many companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, IBM, and others have been very innovative in providing child care assistance for their employees. Small businesses in particular are finding it difficult to meet the child care needs of their employees, but recognize the importance of that help. 
The CIDCARE Act creates a tax credit for employers providing or otherwise supporting high-quality child care arrangements for their employees. On the Budget 
Reconciliation bill passed by the Senate, Senator Kohl introduced an amendment to provide a time-limited tax credit for employers who provide child care for their employees. To reinforce the importance of the Kohl amendment, I have included it in CIDCARE. Fifty percent of the expenses incurred by a business to meet the child care needs of employees will be credited toward the business' Federal tax liability. Eligible expenses are capped at $150,000 per year, and the tax credit sunsets after three years. 
Costs allowed to businesses under this provision include startup costs, renovations to meet accreditation standards, professional development for child care providers, general operating expenses, subsidized child care for lower paid employees, support for child care resource and referral services and other child care activities. These provisions encourage business involvement and innovation in meeting the child care needs of employees and increasing the demand for higher quality child care. 
Current law prohibits businesses from receiving a charitable deduction for donations made to public entities, such as schools and child care services. CIDCARE will extend eligibility for a business charitable deduction to the donation of educational equipment and supplies donated to public schools, public child care providers, and public child care support entities, such as resource and referral services. If child care is to improve and meet the developmental needs of our Nation's children, every available resource must be made available. Computers which are discarded because they are too slow or have insufficient hard drive capacity, can be the first step into the computer-age for a small child or the link to professional training for a child care provider. 
A critical part of improving the quality of child care is professional development for child care providers. Since the 1970's there has been a decline in child care teacher salaries. In 1990, teachers in child care centers earned an average of $11,500 a year. Assistant teachers, the largest growing segment of child care professionals, were paid 10- to 20-percent less than child care teachers. The 1990 annual income of regulated family child care providers was $10,944 which translates to about $4 an hour. Nonregulated family child care, generally comprised of providers taking care of a smaller number of children, earned an average of $4,275 a year--substantially less than minimum wage. 
With these wages, it is easy to understand why more child care providers do not participate in professional training or attend college classes to improve their skills. The costs of applying for and receiving certification as a qualified child care professional are minimal, but understandably out of reach for many child care providers. 
This legislation will exempt expenses directly related to child care accreditation or becoming credentialed from the 2 percent floor that is applied to miscellaneous itemized deductions. This will at least permit child care providers to receive a full deduction for the expenses associated with improving the child care services which 
they provide. This incentive for professional growth and the development of new skills is a small but critical part of my overall effort to support high-quality child care. 
The last tax modification in CIDCARE creates a very limited exception to the executive use rule governing the tax deduction for home office expenses. The legislation will permit the mixed use of home office space for business and personal purposes to allow a person to care for his or her child. In some ways, the need for this exception comes down to fundamental fairness. How many school holidays, snow days and other times do children accompany their parents into work? 
I can always tell when the schools are unexpectedly closed, by the increased number of little people I see in Senate offices and eateries. I have been in Senate offices and other workplaces where a crib or playpen is clearly in evidence. Yet, none of us question whether our offices are exclusively for business use. One of the big incentives for telecommuting and home-based business is to allow parents to have more time with their families, yet existing law would keep a new mother from legitimately claiming a home office deduction if she has her child sleeping in a crib in a corner of the room where she is working. 
The non-tax related provisions of the legislation are designed to complement and work with the tax provisions. In order for families to be able to take advantage of the increased tax credits for child care in an accredited center or with a provider who has received a child care credential, there need to be more of these high quality centers and better trained providers. Child care providers must have easy, affordable access to training and other activities which will lead to accreditation and credentialing. This effort will require that the federal government join forces with states and the business community. Parents must be made aware of how to identify quality child care and its importance in their children's lives. And the federal government should set an example by requiring that child care centers located in federal facilities meet higher standards of care. It will take all of these provisions, working together, to improve the quality of child care for our children. 
The CIDCARE Act will require that states include the cost of child care in the calculation of child support obligations. When a custodial parent is employed or actively seeking employment, the state procedures for the determination of the amount of child support need to include an amount equal to or more than the child care rates used by the state to administer the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. When child care is being provided in an accredited child care center or by a credentialed child care that rate will be increased by fifty-percent. 
Since the passage of the Child Care and Development Act in 1990, states have been setting `market' or `comparable' rates for child care. CIDCARE uses those rates as a baseline for adding the cost of child care to the amount of child support which a non-custodial parent will be required to pay. Current child support calculations include 
estimates of the other basic expenses necessary to provide financially for a child. In many instances, the expense of child care is the direct result of the divorce or lack of financial support from the non-custodial parent. It is only fair that child care expenses be included in those calculations. If the custodial parent secures higher quality child care, the non-custodial parent will share in the additional costs of that care. Children should not be forced into poor quality child care because a non-custodial parent refused to share in the additional expense of higher quality care. 
The CIDCARE bill establishes a $260 million competitive grant program to assist states in improving the quality of child care. To be eligible, a state must not have reduced the scope or otherwise decreased the state's licensing requirements since 1995, must be in compliance with the requirements of the Child Care and Development Block Grant, must have drawn down at least 80% of the amount awarded to the state in federal entitlement child care funds requiring a state match, and must conduct annual on-site monitoring of state licensed or otherwise regulated child care facilities, with at least one unannounced visit every 3 years. The legislation requires that a Priority be given to states that raise at least a 10% match for the federal funds from business or other private sources. 
States must use at least 20% of the grant funds awarded to establish a subsidy program to provide salary increases to child care providers who are credentialed in the state. The low level of child care wages is the most often cited reason for the tremendous staff turnover in the child care profession. In areas where child care subsidies as low as fifty cents an hour are put in place, the staff turnover rate drops dramatically. The wage subsidy also will encourage more child care providers to get additional training or advance their education. 
In addition, states will need to use at least twenty-percent of the funds awarded for a grant program to provide start-up funds for partnerships of small businesses to develop and operate child care cooperative services for their employees. While large employers have both the number of employees to justify an on- or near-site child care center and the additional financial resources for start-up costs, small businesses have been struggling with ways to help their employees meet their child care needs. This grant program will provide time-limited help for partnerships of small businesses who work together to develop child care resources for their employees. 
States can use the remainder of grant funds awarded for any of the following activities: developing standards for of entities applying for state recognition for the accreditation and credentialing of child care providers; establishing a scholarship program to help child care providers meet the costs of education and training; expanding state-based child care training and technical assistance activities; improve consumer education efforts including the expansion of resource and referral services and child care complaint systems; providing increased rates of reimbursement provided under federal or state child care assistance for children with special needs; purchasing special 
supplies, equipment, or meeting other extraordinary expenses necessary for the care of special needs children for distribution to child care providers serving special needs children, or providing increased rates of reimbursement provided under federal or state child care assistance for accredited and credentialed care. Each of these activities has been demonstrated to be a contributing factor in improving the quality of child care. 
Parents, child care providers, employers, and others need a constantly updated source of information about improving the quality of child care. States need a central depository where they can learn what other states are doing as well as a place where they can contribute their own ideas and activities from which others can learn. The collection and dissemination of information, demonstrations, and technology is one of the most important roles of the federal government. 
Under provisions in the CIDCARE Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will collect information about the importance of high quality child care (including what it is, how to identify it, why it is important for children), and in partnership with the ADCouncil or similar professional advertising entity, distribute that information through a national public awareness campaign and other mechanisms. To increase the capacity of child care credentialing and accreditation entities, HHS will award competitive grants to child care credentialing and accreditation entities that have not been in existence more than 10 years for the purpose of refining and evaluating their procedures for and methods of granting child care accreditation and/or credentialing. The legislation authorizes $10 million annually, to conduct these information and technology transfer activities. 
The CIDCARE Act authorizes $50 million a year to create and operate a technology-based training infrastructure to enable child care providers nationwide to receive the training, education, and support they need to improve the quality of child care. The bill builds upon existing distance learning, Internet, and satellite resources, with sufficient funding to expand access to affordable child care training and information. The primary focus of the infrastructure will be to disseminate the training necessary to become an accredited child care center or a credentialed child care professional. Training and education, delivered at a minimal cost and accessible to individuals within 25 miles of their homes, will remove one of the most substantial barriers to child care credentialing and accreditation. 
Essentially, the legislation establishes a child care training and education interactive `network', which will be used by child care credentialing and accreditation entities for training, skills testing, and other activities needed to achieve and maintain child care credentialing and accreditation. Entities recognized by 2 or more states as providing accepted child care credentialing or accreditation services will be active participants in decisions governing the use of the child care `training network.' Time lines for the creation and implementation of the infrastructure and caps on administrative costs are 
included in the bill provide both financial and programmatic accountability. 
Through the child care training infrastructure, a no interest revolving loan fund is established to enable child care providers and child care support entities to purchase computers, satellite dishes, and other technological equipment which enable them to participate in the child care training provided on the national infrastructure. For the first five years of the legislation, at least ten-percent of the funds appropriated for the child care training infrastructure will be placed into the revolving loan fund. This part of CIDCARE, like similar federal loan programs, establishes that the funds be kept in a separate interest bearing account, establishes application procedures, terms and conditions for the approval of such loans, and procedures for handling loan defaults. 
At the current time, child care centers located in federal facilities are not required to meet even basic safety and health requirements. They are not subject to state or local laws or regulations governing the operation of a child care center. The CIDCARE Act will require federal child care centers (those in buildings leased or owned by the federal government--legislative, executive, judicial branches) to meet all state and local licensing and other regulatory requirements related to the provision of child care, within six months of the passage of this legislation--or make substantial progress towards meeting those requirements. The appropriate Administrator of each branch of government shall issue regulations specifying center-based child care accreditation standards and require all child care facilities in federal buildings under their control achieve accreditation within 3 years of the passage of this legislation. 
If the child care program located in a federal facility fails to be in compliance, or show substantial compliance with state and local licensing requirements within six months or with the identified accreditation standards within three years, the agency must cease providing child care in that child care center. On-site monitoring to ensure compliance with these regulations and standards must be performed by an outside entity. The legislation authorizes $900 thousand to the General Services Administration (GSA) to implement this provision. 
CIDCARE will require that federal child care programs provided by the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Departments of Defense, Education, Housing and Urban Affairs, Justice, and Labor, will ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that by October 1, 2001, any child care made available through programs funded or operated by those Departments and the Corporation, be provided by an accredited child care facility or a credentialed child care professional. The federal government needs to demonstrate a commitment to quality child care, by raising the standards it applies to its own programs. 
The CIDCARE Act will expand the Community Development Block Grant to include the renovation or upgrading of child care facilities to meet accreditation standards as an 
allowable use of the grant funds. It also will extend existing Perkins and Stafford Loan forgiveness programs to include persons who work as credentialed professionals in a child care setting. Just as these loan forgiveness programs helped encourage more people to become teachers, I hope that this extension of these two educational loan programs to child care providers will result in more and better qualified child care providers. To be eligible for loan forgiveness, the person must be employed full time providing child care services and have a degree in early childhood education or development or receive professional child care credentials. 
The need for high-quality child care is compelling. Having affordable, convenient child care is tied directly to a family's ability to produce income. Good child care can be an effective way to support the healthy development of children, particularly in the acquisition of social and language skills. For the millions of children who spend much of their preschool lives and many of their nonschool hours being cared for by someone other than their parents, child care provides the foundation upon which all future education will be built--and determines to a large extent whether that foundation will be strong or weak. 
As we all know, quality child care costs money. It costs money to parents who bear the biggest burden for the cost of child care. It costs businesses both through the direct assistance that they provide to employees to help with the costs of child care, and through their ability to hire and retain a skilled work force. It costs Government through existing tax provisions, direct spending, and discretionary spending targeted at child care. But the costs of not making this investment are even higher. Those costs can be measured in the expense of remedial education, the expansion of an unskilled labor force, the increase in prison populations, and most importantly, the blunted potential of millions of children. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dodd, Senator Roberts and me in support of the CIDCARE bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, 3 days ago, the heavens opened over northern Vermont. Torrential rains sent floodwaters ripping through communities and over farmland, tearing bridges from their foundations, shredding roads and stranding hundreds of people. The floods that swept through sections of northern Vermont were the worst in over 70 years. Up to 6 inches of rain fell overnight. Flash floods turned quiet rivers and streams into raging waterways in the early morning darkness, disrupting the peaceful existence of thousands of Vermonters. 
Yesterday, I spoke with several town officials and residents who were hit the hardest. They gave me firsthand accounts of the damage to their communities. In some towns, bridges were swept away, roads were washed out, pavements were ripped up, cars and trucks were overturned, perhaps were destroyed, trees were uprooted, homes were lifted from their foundations and filled with water. 
Monday night's torrential rains were followed by a day of heroism--neighbors, rescue workers, families and friends came together in Vermont's close communities. In Eden, 300 Cub Scouts were evacuated after the bridge into their camp was washed away. In Cambridge, rescue workers saved a 14-year-old girl and her dog who were stranded on a washed out roadway. In Montgomery, 11 people were pulled from a mobile home roof and carried to safety in a bucket loader moments before the trailer was swept away. Volunteers made 1,000 sandwiches for rescue workers, and neighbors opened their homes to those who were driven from their own. 
There are many courageous stories and events that took place during the crisis, and knowing Vermonters like I do, I know there were many more heroic stories long after the rivers had receded and the officials had left town. 
Mr. President, I am proud of and commend the Vermonters who united during this time of disaster to save lives and communities. The damage has been substantial and much work still needs to be done. I stand ready in every way to assist, if possible, the people of Vermont to help rebuild their communities and lives. I know our Governor has surveyed the situation and he has made recommendations to the President for Federal help. I know the congressional delegation from Vermont is doing all it can to make sure the lives that have been disrupted are put back as close to normal as possible as soon as possible. 
Mr. President, I thank you for this time. I yield the floor and make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Tennessee Valley Authority was created as part of the New Deal to bring economic development and electricity to the Tennessee Valley. Much has changed since the 1930's. Fortunately, rural Americans now enjoy electricity, and the economy of the Tennessee Valley has improved significantly. That region's economy, in fact, is doing quite well and now is home to industry and businesses like Saturn Automotive and Gateway Computer. It's time for TVA to change, too. 
Over the past six decades, TVA has become, by its own measure, the Nation's largest electric utility company, providing some of the cheapest electricity in the Nation. TVA's current managers are trying aggressively to prepare this giant government-owned utility for the competition that may result from deregulation. Earlier this year, in testimony before the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, TVA's Chairman argued that, in order to help prepare for this competition, the direct Federal appropriation to TVA should end. In fact, he stated, `With your help, we can end taxpayer funding of TVA appropriated programs and begin a new era for TVA.' It is my understanding that the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee has voted to codify that request. 
Reforming TVA should no longer be a controversial activity. More and more lawmakers have introduced bills to re-think the giant agency as we look toward a deregulated electricity industry and a balanced Federal budget. Even TVA's Chair, as mentioned before, has stated that the agency should forego its $106 million annual appropriation. TVA's former chief financial officer has gone further, arguing that the Federal Government should sell TVA. Sale, he argues, would generate big savings for taxpayers; reduce the Federal debt; provide a model for privatization; and move one of the largest electric companies out from under the burden of Federal bureaucracy into the private sector, where it would pay taxes. 
Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues who will sit on the conference committee to take a first step toward reforming TVA by eliminating the agency's entire appropriation. I also urge my colleagues to consider more substantial changes to TVA in the context of reducing taxpayer subsidies and opening the electricity market to true competition.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I voice my support for meeting U.S. commitments to the International Development Association [IDA] by fully funding replenishment to IDA-10 and IDA-11. 
The International Development Association was established in 1960 to lend to the poorest and least creditworthy developing countries on confessional terms. Only countries with a per capita income below $905 with limited or no ability to borrow on market terms and a record of using IDA resources effectively are eligible. Currently, 79 counties meet IDA's loan criteria--55 percent of the world's population. Twenty countries have graduated from IDA. Very notably, three of these graduate countries--Botswana, Korea, and Turkey--are now IDA donors. This is a solid rate of success. 
IDA provides development assistance to poor countries through loans, rather than grants. Loans must be repaid in full. IDA funds come largely from contributions of 35 donor countries negotiated in general replenishment. Increasingly, repayments of past IDA loans are supplementing IDA income. As a result, the U.S. share of contributions to IDA has decreased by 20 percent since it was established in 1960. 
The administration's request of $1.035 billion for IDA is divided into two parts: $235 million to meet U.S. payments to IDA's 10th replenishment and $800 million for the first of two U.S. payments for IDA-11. The subcommittee recommends $950 million in funding for IDA for fiscal year 1998. This would fully fund the first U.S. payment for IDA-11 but not fully meet payment owned for IDA-10. I support increasing the appropriation for IDA by $84.5 million to fund both replenishments in full. 
I appreciate the work that the subcommittee has done to address a major concern associated with IDA: Restrictions on U.S. procurement opportunities imposed by the Interim Trust Fund [ITF]. The ITF was created by donors who did not want to disrupt IDA's operations by leaving a 1-year gap in new funding when the U.S. budget situation precluded us from meeting commitments to both IDA-11 and IDA-10. At that time, controversy emerged over the terms of the ITF which limited decisionmaking and procurement to contributing countries only. As a result, U.S. officials and businesses were excluded from participating in projects financed by the $3.3 million fund. Last year, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill contained a provision that required the administration to work with other donors to modify procurement restrictions. The administration has negotiated an agreement with the ITF whereby $1 billion, or about one-third, of projects financed by the trust fund have not yet been completed. Full funding of IDA-10 and IDA-11 will allow U.S. firms to bid on these contracts. The Foreign Operations Subcommittee's efforts on the matter of U.S. procurement are commendable.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I Mr. President, thank the chairman for his excellent work on the fiscal year 1998 energy and water appropriations measure. Senator Domenici clearly understands the importance of renewable energy to the future of this Nation. I wish to commend him for his dedication to the development of solar, wind, biomass, and other technologies that are vital to our Nation's energy interests. I know many of my colleagues join me in thanking him for his leadership in this area. I would merely like to clarify a couple of the provisions regarding renewable energy in the energy and water appropriations bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. The report language on wind energy research, development and deployment restricts support for small wind, when in fact the Department of Energy has several ongoing research activities in this area. Is it the intention of the Senate that these and other cost-shared programs currently conducted in collaboration with DOE, the national laboratories, and U.S. industry should not be continued?

Mr. JEFFORDS. In addition, is it the Senator's understanding that the Solar Thermal Power Program would receive an additional $4.8 million from available funds? And if so, of this amount, $3.8 million will be available for solar dish engine technologies and the remaining $1 million will go to the solar industrial programs. This would bring the total solar thermal account to $19.1 million. 
Further, is it also the Senator's understanding that the solar international account will receive an additional $2 million, bringing the total for this program to $4 million. Is it also the Senator's understanding that the program allocation will be used in support of the Committee on Renewable Energy Commerce and Trade?

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Arts and Humanities Amendments of 1997 along with my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy and my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee. This legislation provides an authorization for the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] and the National Endowment for the Humanities [NEH]--agencies which I believe contribute a great deal to the wealth and richness of our Nation. 
The bill that we are introducing today is based closely on the bill that was passed out of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last Congress by a solid bipartisan vote of 12 to 4. The legislation reflected ideas and consideration from Senators on both sides of the aisle. The result of that collaboration was a strong bill, which makes substantial and needed changes to the agencies while allowing the agencies to continue what they do best--provide support for the arts and humanities in communities throughout this Nation. 
We began the reauthorization process this Congress in May with a hearing which focused on education programs in the arts and humanities. It was clear to me from that hearing that arts education programs and education programs in the humanities make a real difference in the lives of individuals of all ages and from all corners of the country. 
As a result of what I learned at the hearing, the bill that I am introducing today directs the NEA to use any funds appropriated above the fiscal year 1997 level for arts education programs, especially those innovative programs that integrate the arts in the teaching of other core academic subjects. The arts are important to ensuring the future academic success of our Nation's students. In fact, according to college board figures, students of the arts outperform their nonarts peers on the SAT. In 1995, those who had studied the arts for 4 or more years scored 59 points higher in the verbal and 44 points higher in the math portions of the SAT compared with students with no course work or experience in the arts. 
I have only to look in my backyard to understand the importance and value of the NEA and NEH. The benefits of NEA and NEH funding in Vermont are significant and far reaching. Thanks in part to a $30,000 grant from the NEA, folks in 26 Vermont communities will be able to hear the magnificent music of the Vermont Symphony Orchestra. The Vermont Symphony will perform for 12,000 school children as part of a school partnership program, opening their worlds to the magic and wonder of music, many for the first time. Our Vermont Arts Council, through the funds it receives from NEA will support a wide range of arts programs benefiting all Vermonters. The NEH makes a significant and positive difference in the State of Vermont, too. The Vermont Council on the Humanities is a national leader in creating literacy programs which reach individuals of all reading levels and all ages as a result of the funding provided by the NEH. The University of Vermont received a grant from the NEH to catalogue and preserve our State's local newspapers. This grant is part of a national initiative spearheaded by the NEH to ensure that the local papers which chronicle the history of our State and the Nation are available to future generations. 
This bill makes substantial improvement to the way these agencies do business. In addition, the legislation makes it clear that these agencies are meant to serve the American public, especially those who would not otherwise have the arts and humanities available to them. 
This bill proposes significant changes to current law. The changes are far reaching and go the fundamental operations of both the NEA and NEH. It is our hope that these changes will provide guidance and set priorities for funding for projects in an effort to increase access to programs and projects which are of the highest caliber. 
The legislation imposes a new structure on the NEA and NEH, and increases the percentage of funds made available to State councils. It places greater emphasis on ensuring Endowment programs reach underserved communities. 
The bill calls for a merging of many of the administrative functions of the Endowments with the intent of eliminating costly and unnecessary duplication. Administrative funds are capped on a sliding scale. In an effort to further streamline the agencies and cut bureaucracy, the number of members on the National Councils have been decreased. A provision has been included which empowers the NEA and NEH to recapture funds from grants that have gone on to commercial and financial success. Both Endowments are explicitly prohibited from using funds for purposes of lobbying or general membership services. 
Some changes apply only to the NEA. The legislation prohibits the NEA from making nonspecific seasonal support grants. It eliminates subgranting--only States, regional groups, and local arts agencies which are agencies of local government would have the authority to subgrant under this legislation. it restricts grants to individuals to the categories of literature, National Heritage, and Jazz Master fellowships. Non-Federal matching requirements are increased in the National Significance grant category to 3:1 and in some cases, 5:1. We have increased turnover in the panel system and increased lay person participation to ensure greater community involvement and input. In addition, panels are prohibited from recommending specific amounts of grants and will be required to recommend more grants than funding available. The Council, too, will have to recommend approval for more applications than there are funds available. These provision give the chair greater decisionmaking responsibility and make the chair more accountable for grants the agency makes. 
Lastly, but in my opinion one of the most important changes to this bill is the expansion of the Arts and Artifact Indemnity Act. This change will enable extraordinary domestic exhibitions to be eligible for Federal indemnification and afford more Americans access to the great artistic treasures of this Nation. 
Many of my colleagues in the House do not feel that there is a Federal role for the arts, but I do not agree with that position. The role of the States in distributing NEA funds is very important, and for that reasons, this legislation does increase the percentage of funds available to State arts and agencies and State humanities organizations. Still, in my view, there is an important national role that must be preserved. The New York-based Chamber Music America received an NEA grant of $145,000 for a residency program which benefited rural communities in Arkansas, California, Pennsylvania, Texas, Kentucky, Maine, and Oregon. The NEA made a grant to the YMCA in Chicago, IL, for its National Readings Tour of the National Writer's Voice project which established literary arts centers in YMCA's in New Mexico, South Dakota, New Jersey, California, North Carolina, New Hampshire, and Florida. Both these grants benefited people far beyond the boundary of the State that received the grant. They are just two examples of extraordinary arts programs that would not longer be available to people in my State or any other State if all NEA funds were block granted. 
In setting clear priorities for the NEA and NEH, and striking a balance between leadership at the State level and leadership at the national level, I am confident that both agencies will be even better able to serve their constituency--all the people of this country. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be included as part of the Record.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to James Bowse. Jim died unexpectedly on Tuesday, June 17. As president/chief executive officer at the Rutland Regional Medical Center since 1989, Jim was considered to be one of the most progressive and effective leaders in the field of health care. 
Jim understood the challenges facing community hospitals, but never lost sight of the human element in medicine. During his tenure at the Rutland facility Jim was instrumental in creating the first State-owned health maintenance organization [HMO]. He established a Rutland-based system of physicians to provide high quality service while simultaneously containing costs. 
Jim strove to develop a community approach in medicine. To that end, he maintained reserves to cover the costs associated with patients that could not afford the treatment they required. Jim was able to freeze patient fees since 1991, while doubling annual revenues to $100 billion. In addition, he played a vital role in the establishment of an orthopedic clinic and the expansion of outpatient services as well as preventative health projects. 
Jim had a great sense of humor and an uncanny ability to make the most complex issues seem simple. His dedication to the people of Vermont is in the State's finest tradition. Through his efforts, Jim made a lasting impression upon the community which will be slow to fade. I extend my condolences to his family and friends.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be offering, with my colleague Senator Patrick Leahy, an amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill to provide for the construction of a combined support and maintenance shop [CSMS] at Camp Johnson, VT. 
This project is to be constructed in Colchester, VT and used by the Vermont National Guard to meet its support level maintenance mission. The quantity, size and type of equipment now assigned to the Vermont Army National Guard have required them to propose the construction of this CSMS. The new facility will have administrative offices and allied shops as well as special bays for maintenance work on all types of vehicles. The design money for this project was approved by the Congress last year. 
The Vermont Army National Guard has stretched the limits of the current facility which was built over 40 years ago, in 1956. The current facility has very significant shortfalls in all office and shop areas. The existing work bays cannot accommodate the M-1 tank. In addition, essential maintenance and maintenance training is consistently delayed due to the lack of space. Without the construction of a new facility readiness of the Vermont Army National Guard will be adversely affected. 
In order to assure that the Vermont Army National Guard is ready at all times to meet the needs of our nation's defense, Senator Leahy and I have worked together on this project. I am pleased that the Vermont Army National Guard can move forward on this CSMS and hope that my colleagues will support the efforts that Senator Leahy and I have taken to insure that the Vermont Army National Guard can meet the military needs of our country in the next century. 
I commend Chairman Thurmond for his foresight to realize that his new facility is essential in order for the Vermont Army National Guard to meet the anticipated demands on them in the coming years.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, more than 20 years ago Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to promote Government purchases of products made from recycled materials. Since then, State and local governments throughout the country have enacted similar policies. Ten years ago, only 13 States and a handful of local governments had buy recycled laws. Today, at least 45 States and more than 500 local governments have established legal requirements to purchase recycled content products. In 1993, the administration issued Executive Order 12873 which reinforced the principle of increasing the Federal Government's use of recycled-content products, especially paper products. 
Yet in 1996, the Department of Defense, the single largest consumer of copy paper in the world, had a compliance record of only 14 percent regarding its procurement of copy paper. Although DOD should be complimented for recently volunteering to buy only recycled-content copy paper, its decision was due to the General Services Administration's initiative to set the price of recycled paper at 5 cents cheaper than virgin paper. History leads us to assume that DOD will revert to the policy of buying virgin paper should the price shift a nickel. 
Well, Mr. President, price is important, but it is only one factor in the equation. As the largest user, DOD must be the role model for other Government agencies and comply with the intent of Congress and the administration. This amendment affords DOD the flexibility of buying nonrecycled paper if the price differential is unreasonable compared to virgin paper, while defining the term `unreasonable' as `greater than 7 percent'. 
Additionally, the intent of this amendment is to cause Defense Department procurement offices to buy copy paper in an environmentally responsible manner and is not meant to place unreasonable constraints on the process. It, therefore, contains provisions which allow procuring agencies to choose not to buy the recycled paper if the product is unavailable within a reasonable period of time, or if the product does not meet reasonable performance standards. 
Finally, this amendment builds on the intent of the executive order and extends it into the 21st century. Under this amendment, the required postconsumer content will rise to 50 percent in 2004. This initiative is based upon ongoing technological advances within the paper industry and the expectation that they will push down the cost of recycled paper in future years. If DOD cannot meet this requirement, a provision is included in the amendment which will allow them to report to Congress for purposes of gaining a deferment. 
Mr. President, only through legislative action can we ensure that DOD will continue to shoulder its environmental responsibilities and serve as the role model it must be.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a natural follow-on to the previous amendment. We are all aware of the need for good child care. There are more than 12 million children who are in child care. At least 15 percent are in care that is so bad that their health and safety are threatened; 40 percent of the infants in child care are in very risky situations. 
For the many parents who would change their child care if they could find and afford better, this amendment provides tax relief through the child care tax credits, and it helps business meet the child care needs of their employees through the business tax credits and deductions. 
We expand choices for parents, because if you can't afford the child care you find, you don't have much choice. Representatives of the religious and for-profit child care providers worked with us on the language related to accreditation and credentialing. 
I ask unanimous consent that the following Members be added as cosponsors: Senators Dodd, Roberts, Kohl, Landrieu, Snowe, Johnson, Chafee, D'Amato, Collins, Gordon Smith, Campbell, Kennedy, Enzi, Allard, Stevens, Grassley, Mikulski, Kerry, and Graham.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, tomorrow I will introduce my amendment on child care. 
Today, there are more than 12 million children under the age of five--including half of all infants under one year of age--who spend at least part of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. The past two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the number of women in the paid labor force. More than 60 percent of women with preschool aged children, are employed full- or part-time. For most of these families, child care is a requirement, not an option. 
Women now constitute 46 percent of our Nation's labor force. Most women are not working just to achieve a degree of personal growth outside the home, but to meet their family's basic needs. Their employment is not a choice, but an essential part of their family's economic survival. 
Similarly, child care that is affordable and convenient is necessary for most women working outside the home. Many of the traditional sources of child care are no longer available--as many of the friends, neighbors, grandparents, and other relatives who used to be available to provide child care are also working. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that for parents who must work, child care services that are dependable and of high quality make it easier to find and keep a job. Good child care helps parents reach and maintain economic self-sufficiency. There is a clear connection between child care and the production of income. Congress acknowledged this when is passed welfare reform last year. 
Since 1990, the costs of child care have risen about 6 percent annually. This is almost triple the annual increase in the cost of living. At the same time, there are strong indicators that the quality of child care has significantly decreased during that same period of time. Parents are paying more but getting less. 
The costs of child care are almost wholly dependent upon the geographic area, the type of child care, and the age of the child. For example, a family purchasing full-time child care services for a 4-year old in rural New York using a family child care home may pay as little as $60 a week. In contrast, a family with an infant using a child care center in New York City may pay more than $250 a week. 
I think that few of us know how much child care costs. The Senate Employee's Child Care Center costs between $150 and $175 a week--$7,800 to $9,100 a year. That puts it in the high-middle range in terms of costs for the Washington, DC area. The younger the child, the higher the costs--and Senate Employee's Child Care Center does not accept children under 18 months old. 
For a 3- to 4-year-old, which is the least expensive age group, the national average for center-based child care is $4,600 a year. The average cost for high quality care, such as that provided by the Senate Employee's Child Care Center, is between $8,500 and $9,100 a year. 
A family normally spends about 20 percent of its income on housing and 10 percent on food. The costs of child care for a low- or middle-income family can rival the cost of housing and be double the cost of food. Even though most of us recognize the critical part that child care plays in the economic survival of families, we often fail to recognize it as a basic cost which consumes a significant portion of a family's income. 
Parents can only purchase child care they can afford. While the supply of child care has increased over the past 10 years, shortages are still the norm for those in rural areas, those with school-aged children, and for lower-income families. Those who do find care that is affordable and convenient are often unsatisfied with the quality of the care their child receives. In fact, one quarter of all parents would change their child care arrangement if they could find and afford something better. 
The quality of child care in America is very troubling. A recent nationwide study found that 40 percent of the child care provided to infants in child care centers was potentially injurious. Fifteen-percent of center-based child care providers for all preschoolers are so bad that a child's health and safety are threatened; 70 percent are mediocre--not hurting or helping children; and 15 percent actively promote a child's development. Center-based child care, the object of this study, is the most heavily regulated and frequently monitored type of child care. Children in less regulated settings are predicted to be far worse. 
Combining the research on the quality of child care with the breakthroughs on the development of the human brain produces a very disturbing situation. Many children enter child care by 11 weeks of age, are in care for close to 30 hours a week, and often stay in some form of child care until they enter school. During that same period of life, a child's brain is undergoing a series of extraordinary changes. 
In the first 3 years of life, the brain either makes the connections it needs for learning or it atrophies, making later efforts at remediation in learning, behavior, and thinking difficult, at best. The experiences and stimulation that a caretaker provide to a child are the foundations upon which all future learning is built. The brain's greatest and most critical growth spurt is between birth and 10 years of age--precisely the time when non-parental child care is most frequently utilized. A Time magazine special report on `How a Child's Brain Develops' (February 3, 1997) said it best, `. . . Good, affordable day care is not a luxury or a fringe benefit for welfare mothers and working parents but essential brain food for the next generation.' While bad child care can seriously impair a child's development, high-quality child care significantly increases the chances of good developmental outcomes for children. 
Think about it. At the most important time in the development of a child's brain, 12 million children are being cared for by people who are paid less than the person who picks up your garbage each week, and are required to have less training and less skills-based testing than the person who cuts your hair. Child care providers play an important role in a child's development, for they help fine-tune the child's capacity to think and process information, social skills, emotional health, and acquisition of language. 
Last year, our goal in child care was to streamline Federal assistance by creating a cohesive structure for Federal assistance and to provide sufficient Government funds to subsidize child care for welfare recipients who were transitioning into work. This year our goal must be to promote the healthy development of children in child care. I am worried that the pressure of the need to accommodate the increasing demand for child care will force many into forgoing quality just to increase the number of child care slots available. 
This amendment, then, incorporates modifications to five different sections of the Tax Code. Each of the provisions has been included to solve a specific problem in an effort to improve the quality of child care. Taken as a whole, these provisions represent a comprehensive effort to increase the supply while simultaneously creating a demand for high-quality child care, and making it affordable for low- and middle-income families. 
To offset the cost of these changes, my amendment reduces, but does not eliminate, the dependent care tax credit for upper-income taxpayers and the amount that an employee can place in a dependent care assistance plan used to reimburse non-accredited or non-credential child care is gradually decreased. In addition, the amendment expands the coordinated enforcement efforts of the Internal Revenue Service and the HHS Office of Child Support Enforcement, which will significantly reduce the amount of fraud related to illegal tax deduction and credit claims by non-custodial parents. 
The first provision in the amendment makes several changes in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit [CDCTC]. This tax credit is the largest tax-based subsidy for child care. My amendment raises the income level for the receipt of the highest percentage of employment-related child care costs from $10,000 to $20,000. The percentage is decreased at a rate of 1 percent for each additional $2,500 in adjusted gross income and sets a minimum percentage of 10 percent for incomes of $70,000 and above. 
This change represents a more equitable distribution of limited resources based on the percentage of income a family must use to meet child care expenses. For families qualifying for the EITC, my amendment makes the child care tax credit refundable, on a quarterly basis. This will enable many low-income working families to 
move from part-time to full-time employment, by easing the burden of child care costs and having the money available at regular intervals throughout the year. 
Finally, the amendment establishes, over a 5-year period, different rates for the tax credit, dependent on whether the child care is provided in an accredited child care facility or by a credentialed professional. This will reward parents who choose high-quality child care and help defray the additional costs of that care. 
I am sensitive to the concerns of colleagues who object to reducing the child care tax credit. But before you judge this reduction too harshly, let's put it into perspective. The tax credit remains at or above the current rate of 20 percent for parents with adjusted gross incomes of $45,000 or less, regardless of the type of child care. The median income of families with children nationally is $37,000. While there are wide differences in between States, there are only four States where the median exceeds $45,000 AGI triggering a reduction in the current rate of 20 percent. Most States are significantly below this trigger. 
At the end of the 5-year phase in period, the tax credit remains at or above the current 20 percent rate for families with an AGI of $55,000. No States have median incomes of families with children which exceed the $55,000 AGI level for high quality child care which triggers a reduction below current child care tax rate. Families with incomes at or above $70,000 will still receive a tax credit of 10 percent, increased to 12.5 percent if high quality care is used. 
In terms of money, a 1 percent decrease in the child care tax credit equals $24 when care for one child is claimed, and $48 for two or more children. Families making $70,000 or more are the hardest hit by my amendment. Yet their maximum financial cost is $240 a year for one child, or $480 a year for two or more children--about half of one percent of their adjusted gross income. 
The second area of changes occurs in the Dependent Care Assistance Plan [DCAP]. The amendment increases the amount that an employee can contribute to a DCAP account, if the funds are used to pay for the care of two or more eligible persons. In addition, the amount of DCAP contributions is increased for high-quality care and decreased for care that is provided by an unaccredited child care facility or a person who has not received a professional credential. These differential rates are phased in over a 5-year period in order for child care providers to achieve accreditation or become credentialed in child care. 
Current law prohibits DCAP from being used to pay relatives for care. While I support needed controls on the use of DCAP accounts in most cases, my amendment would make a very limited exception to this prohibition. DCAP payments could be made to pay a parent or grandparent to care for a newborn child. The DCAP account could be joined at anytime during a pregnancy. The funds would be available for up to 
12 months from the date of deposit into the employee's DCAP account--because babies have a timetable all their own when it comes time to be born. 
The last change my amendment makes in DCAP is through the addition of a requirement that Federal employees have the opportunity to contribute to Dependent Care Assistance Plans. Private employees, as well as many State and local governments, have had DCAP available for their employees since 1981. Consistent with the intent of the Congressional Accountability Act, I want to make this child care subsidy available to Federal workers, including legislative branch employees. 
Child care is a growing concern to businesses big and small. Employers are coming to the realization that affordable, convenient high-quality child care is a critical element in hiring and retaining skilled employees. Many companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, IBM, and others have been very innovative in providing child care assistance for their employees. Small businesses in particular are finding it difficult to meet the child care needs of their employees, but recognize the importance of that help. 
I am defering to my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, who has an excellent amendment providing a tax credit to businesses who provide child care services and support for their employees. My amendment included a similar provision, but because Senator Kohl has been working on this aspect of child care for so long, I dropped my provision and urge my colleagues to vote for his amendment as well as this one. 
Current law prohibits businesses from receiving a charitable deduction for donations made to public entities, such as schools and child care services. My amendment will extend eligibility for a business charitable deduction to the donation of educational equipment and supplies donated to public schools, public child care providers and public child care support entities, such as resource and referral services. If child care is to improve and meet the developmental needs of our Nation's children, every available resource must be made available. Computers which are discarded because they are too slow or have insufficient hard drive capacity, can be the first step into the computer-age for a small child or the link to professional training for a child care provider. 
A critical part of improving the quality of child care is professional development for child care providers. Since the 1970's there has been a decline in child care teacher salaries. In 1990, teachers in child care centers earned an average of $11,500 a year. Assistant teachers, the largest growing segment of child care professionals, were paid 10 to 20 percent less than child care teachers. The 1990 annual income of regulated family child care providers was $10,944 which translates to about $4 an hour. Nonregulated family child care, generally comprised of providers taking care of a smaller number of children, earned an average of $4,275 a year--substantially less 
than minimum wage. With these wages, it is easy to understand why more child care providers do not participate in professional training or attend college classes to improve their skills. The costs of applying for and receiving certification as a qualified child care professional are minimal, but understandably out of reach for many child care providers. 
My amendment will exempt expenses directly related to child care accreditation or becoming credentialed from the 2 percent floor that is applied to miscellaneous itemized deductions. This will at least permit child care providers to receive a full deduction for the expenses associated with improving the child care services which they provide. This incentive for professional growth and the development of new skills is a small but critical part of my overall effort to support high-quality child care. 
The last provision in my amendment creates a very limited exception to the executive use rule governing the tax deduction for home office expenses. The amendment will permit the mixed use of home office space for business and personal purposes to allow a person to care for his or her child. In some ways, the need for this exception comes down to fundamental fairness. How many school days, snow days and other times do children accompany their parents into work? I can always tell when the schools are unexpectedly closed, by the increased number of little people I see in Senate offices and eateries. I have been in Senate offices and other workplaces when a crib or playpen is clearly in evidence. Yet, none of us question whether our offices are exclusively for business use. One of the big incentives for telecommuting and home-based business is to allow parents to have more time with their families, yet existing law would keep a new mother from legitimately claiming a home office deduction if she has her child read a book or play in a corner of the room where she is working. 
The need for high-quality child care is compelling. Having affordable, convenient child care is tied directly to a family's ability to produce income. Good child care can be an effective way to support the healthy development of children, particularly in the acquisition of social and language skills. For the millions of children who spend much of their pre-school lives being cared for by someone other than their parents, child care provides the foundation upon which all future education will be built--and determines to a large extent whether that foundation will be strong or weak. 
As we all know, quality child care costs money. It costs money to parents who bear the biggest burden for the cost of child care. It costs businesses both through the direct assistance that they provide to employees to help with the costs of child care, and through their ability to hire and retain a skilled work force. It costs Government through existing tax provisions, direct spending, and discretionary spending targeted at child care. But the costs of not making this investment are even higher. Those costs can be measured in the cost of remedial education, the increase of an unskilled labor force, the increase in prison populations, and most importantly, the blunted potential of millions of children. 
I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to the budget reconciliation act.

Mr. JEFFORDS. We will discuss the amendment which we will be offering on the floor at the appropriate time. 
Mr. President, it is difficult to find high quality child care that is appropriate, affordable, and convenient for children today. How government can help parents achieve that goal is a very difficult and compelling question. I have, with my cosponsors Senators Dodd, Roberts, Kohl, Snowe, Landrieu, and Johnson put together an amendment which we will be offering. On the one hand the amendment will make it easier to find better child care that is more affordable. At the same time the amendment does some engineering by making it possible for more child care facilities and individual providers to improve their services and receive higher tax deductions for those efforts. My amendment also to shifts the amount of money that is available to parents in the child care tax credit and the dependent care assistance program to help them afford a better quality of care they may now be available to them. This combination of assistance for providers and parents will encourage that the child care facilities and individual providers will provide better care for the 12 million children who are in child care. 
How we accomplish this is: First of all, to help middle- and low-income families, the amendment increases the level of income which qualifies for the maximum amount of the child care tax credit benefits $10,000 to $20,000. We make the child care tax credit refundable for low-income working families who qualify for the EITC. Then we go to the other end of the scale and phase the tax credit down, but not out, for wealthier people with incomes over $70,000, then we can pay for the increases at the lower end. 
I also feel strongly that it is important to assist those businesses that are providing child care for their employees. The amendment creates an incentive which will allow businesses to receive a 50 percent tax credit for up to $150,000 in expenses to operate, improve, and develop appropriate child care for their employees. 
As we all know from recent studies, the healthy development of children can very dramatically enhance, including their potential for future educational and social achievement, depending upon the kind of nurturing and affection they receive early in life, and the developmental and educational activities they are exposed to at birth. In order to make sure that kind of care is available for those children who need to be in child care while their parents work. This amendment provides the necessary incentives so they can find and afford to receive the care that will be safe and provide their children with a better chance for healthy development. That will be required if we expect to have a skilled workforce in the new world of the future. 
What we are trying to do here is to balance the need to reduce the deficit and get the budget under control, with the need to improve the quality of child care for all children who must use it. Keeping in mind the funds that are available. We have offsets to pay for this child care amendment, which I think are very appropriate. 
I yield to the Senator from Connecticut for a further explanation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. There is nothing the Senator says that we disagree with. But if you take a look at the studies that give you an idea of children who are being placed in situations which do not have that kind of care, the question is whether you should reward them the same as you do others that do have good health care. In this study, 40 percent of the health care provided infants in child care centers was potentially injurious. Fifteen percent of center-based child care for all preschoolers was so bad that the child's health and safety were threatened; 70 percent were mediocre. This is the study. 
If you are faced with those, and you understand the dramatic problems that can cause in a child, then you ought to have some way to give the parents of children a means of determining that they can be assured they are not going to have their child damaged. Granted, family situations or whatever else is some of the best care, obviously, and loving and nurturing. A parent is probably better than most child care things you can do. But at least people ought to know that there is someone who is saying your child is not going to be injured in that care. That is all we are trying to do.

This is big reason for this amendment. We are trying to help people with limited resources by shifting the money where it will do best, provide access to best child care.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Pension ProSave Act with Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico. Senator Bingaman has done yeoman's work in drafting this bill. I hope my colleagues will take time to read the bill and join us as cosponsors. 
As the average age of Americans is rising at a steady rate, we all have become more aware of the importance of retirement programs and retirement security. At the same time, only about half of all workers are covered by a retirement program--and of those, many who are covered, work for a Federal, State, or local government entity. An incredible 87 percent of workers employed by small businesses, those with fewer than 20 employees, have no private retirement or pension coverage. Less than 40 percent of the 33 million Americans aged 65 and older collect a pension, other than Social Security. These numbers are cause for concern. 
There are three sources for retirement security: Social Security, personal savings and a pension. Our bill has been offered in an effort to expand pension coverage, especially among small business establishments where coverage and participation is least likely to occur. The complexity and expense involved in setting up a pension plan is daunting. It is outside the grasp of many small businesses. In addition to administrative complexity and the cost of hiring an actuary, accountant and a lawyer to set up a plan, a small business often decides against plan sponsorship because of laws and regulations that actually discriminate against them, such as the prohibition on matching contributions for self-employed individuals, or limitations on contributions for small plans that are even lower than those permitted for the medium-sized or large pension plan. 
Pension ProSave would permit the establishment of either a simplified defined contribution or a defined benefit pension plan or both, with greatly reduced recordkeeping, reporting and regulatory requirements. The ProSave system encourages thrift, through its defined contribution provisions, which are individual account plans and similar in concept to an IRA or a 401(k) plan, and through its simplified defined benefit plan provisions which are traditional pension plans promising a specific benefit payment upon retirement. 
In addition, one of the most appealing features of Pension ProSave is the portability clearinghouse. The clearinghouse would make it easier for workers with ProSave accounts to take their pensions with them as they change jobs. True pension portability has been a most elusive objective for policymakers and yet it is one of the most important features that Americans want in pension programs. 
A lack of portability also discourages long-term pension savings because it can encourage leakage. Pension system leakage occurs when a worker changes jobs and either cashes out a pension benefit or receives a lump sum distribution from a retirement plan and spends the money, rather than saving it. Taxing distributions has not stopped leakage from the system. The more difficult it is for that worker to transfer his account from one plan to another, the more likely it is that the worker will just spend the money. The more complicated and punitive the laws and regulations surrounding pension rollovers, the less likely a worker is to bother to make one. He or she will simply pay the penalty tax and spend the money. 
Consequently, pension experts have spent a great deal of time and effort trying to figure out ways to ease these pension rollovers and overcome obstacles to portability so that people can save their all retirement money in a single account. 
Let me pause for a moment to say that while Pension ProSave's portability feature is the result of many years of consultation and careful drafting, we realize that it would be quite difficult to justify a new government sponsored entity in these days of fiscal stringency. Our experience with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. leads me to suggest that there could be a more efficient means of making Pension ProSave accounts portable than by establishing a new government sponsored entity to manage and invest them. 
Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable and yet can be invested in banks, certificates of deposit, mutual funds, equities or any number of other investment vehicles. Should we permit Pension ProSave accounts to be managed and invested in the private sector and if so, how should that be accomplished? By leveraging the power of the private sector, savers have the potential for more investment choices, and for higher rates of return on their investments. In addition, there currently exists in the private sector, mutual fund/401(k) clearinghouses which are used to track individual accounts and keep records of investments and account balances. Are these models for the Pension ProSave clearinghouse? 
I look forward to hearing about these and other substantive and drafting issues from experts who are concerned about increasing retirement savings at the individual level and in increasing retirement coverage among small businesses where it is needed the most. I am especially interested in the concept of a simplified defined benefit plan which is portable and hope that we can explore that issue when hearings are held on this bill in the Labor and Human Resources Committee. Pension ProSave Act is a good bill. I am proud to cosponsor it and thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership in bringing us together to introduce it.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Kennedy]. Briefly, this amendment would rewrite title VII of the reconciliation bill, which includes the student loan provisions reported by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources by a vote of 17 to 1. 
I have two major reasons for opposing this amendment. First, it will harm students by destabilizing the guaranteed loan program; and, second, it addresses issues which belong in the debate of reauthorization of the Higher Education Act--not the budget reconciliation bill. 
Let me be clear. Adoption of the Kennedy amendment will harm students--not help them. No one in the Senate is more committed to improving educational opportunities than I am. I have worked to strengthen student loan programs for over 22 years. If I honestly believed that this amendment was in the best interests of students, I would support it. It is precisely because of my commitment to the well being of students, however, that I so strongly oppose this amendment. 
I want to take a few minutes to explain exactly why this amendment is not in the best interests of students or their families and why it was rejected when it was considered by the Labor Committee. 
First of all, it is important to understand that the proposal which was approved by the committee was carefully crafted to preserve two viable student loan programs--the Federal Family Education Loan [FFEL] Program, guaranteed loans, and the Federal Direct Loan Program. This proposal respects the so-called truce between the two programs which was reflected in the portion of the budget agreement calling for a fair distribution of savings between the two programs. 
The amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts breaks this truce. In the name of helping students, this amendment would drain such a substantial portion of funds from guaranty agencies that the Congressional Budget Office estimate of the amendment assumes the failure of many of these agencies. 
The provisions approved by the committee already recapture $1 billion in guaranty agency reserve funds over the next 5 years. The recall of these funds is conducted in such a way that guaranty agencies with low reserves--Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin--will not be forced to close their doors to the students who depend upon them. 
The Kennedy amendment would nearly double the savings expected from guaranty agencies--calling for an additional $960 million reduction over 5 years. Because the amendment eliminates any assurance that guaranty agencies will receive an administrative cost allowance [ACA] from section 458 funds, the reductions absorbed by guaranty agencies could well be even higher. 
The guaranteed student loan program serves 80 percent of the institutions of higher education in this country and provides over 60 percent of total student loan volume. Yet, the Kennedy amendment makes no provision whatsoever for mitigating the severe disruption to student borrowers which will occur when agencies inevitably fail. If the goal is to enhance the direct loan program by crippling the guaranteed program, this amendment will be remarkably effective. However, if the goal truly is to help students, we should be working together in the appropriate forum--which is reauthorization, not reconciliation. 
Moreover, I would note that the proposed reduction in the loan origination fee charged to students would not take effect until July 1998. There is no compelling reason to consider this provision outside of the current effort to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. 
Before closing, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the proposal that was approved by the Labor Committee and provide the history and context for this debate. 
The budget agreement approved by the Senate reflects the strong bipartisan support for education. The agreement provides for $35 billion in education related tax provisions, and assumes increased Federal support for special education, Head Start, and funding for literacy programs. The budget agreement supports providing an additional $7.6 billion for Pell grants allowing the maximum grant to grow from $2,700 to $3,000. 
In addition, the subsidy for student loans is assumed to grow from $3.9 billion in 1998 to $4.1 billion in 2002. This will support growth in Federal student loan volume from $28.8 billion in 1998 to $35.8 billion in 2002. These provisions provide an unprecedented level of support for educational opportunity for students at all levels of education. 
In order to accommodate this unprecedented level of support for students, the Senate budget resolution requires $1.792 billion in savings over 5 years from mandatory spending under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. 
The savings required by the agreement and submitted by the committee will not increase costs, reduce benefits, or limit access to loans for students and their families. In accordance with the budget agreement, this proposal attempts to maintain an equitable balance in the savings that are taken from the Federal Family Education Loan Program [FFEL] and the Federal Direct Lending Program [FDLP]. 
The budget submission approved by the committee achieves the required savings by recalling $1.028 billion in excess guaranty agency reserves, eliminating the $10 direct loan origination fee, and reducing the Department of Education's entitlement for the administration of the Federal direct lending program by $604 million. This language preserves a very delicate balance--it achieves major savings and preserves the viability of both loan programs, so that students will not be at risk of losing access to loans. The key provisions of title VII as reported by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources include: 
A. ELIMINATION OF THE DIRECT LENDING LOAN ORIGINATION PAYMENT 
This proposal repeals the provision authorizing the Federal payment of $10 per loan to schools and/or alternate originators who make direct loans. This repeal will provide five-year savings of $160 million. 
B. RECALL OF EXCESS GUARANTY AGENCY RESERVES 
The committee proposal requires the recall of $1.028 billion in reserves and requires each guaranty agency to deposit its share of the total excess reserves into a newly created restricted account in annual payments over the next five years. 
C. REDUCTIONS IN SECTION 458 EXPENDITURES 
Section 458 of the Higher Education Act provides funds to the Secretary of Education for the administrative expenses associated with the direct lending program as well as the administrative cost allowance paid to guaranty agencies for administration of FFEL programs. The committee proposal reduces section 458 expenditures in conformity with the budget agreement resulting in savings of $603 million over 5 years. The Department will continue to receive over $3.3 billion in this account over the next 5 years. 
In order to ensure that these reductions are not redirected from direct lending to the FFEL program and to ensure that an equitable balance in savings is maintained between the two programs, the committee included a provision that reaffirms the Department of Education's obligation to continue to pay the administrative cost allowance to the guaranty agencies. This authority is capped at $170 million in each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and at $150 million in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. 
In summary, these provisions reflect a commitment to preserving two viable student loan programs. Second, they reflect the belief that substantive changes in student aid policy should not be included within reconciliation but should be fully and carefully considered as part our comprehensive effort to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. Consistent with these principles, our proposal meets our budget instruction, preserves two loan programs, and retains the framework of the budget agreement. It deserves the support of the full Senate. 
Finally, let me say that we are here today due to the budget agreement reached between the President and the leadership of the House and Senate. Whatever the disagreements may be about specific details, there is broad support for this agreement and its objectives. That is illustrated by the 17-to-1 vote for the Labor Committee's submission and by the similar margins of support for the proposals reported by other committees. 
Certainly, the agreement is a series of compromises. Implicit in compromise is the fact that neither party got everything it wanted. In the student loan area, the core compromise was that a truce was to be declared in the battle between the Federal Family Education Loan Program--guaranteed loans--and the Federal Direct Loan Program. The approximately $1.8 billion in savings was to be equitably divided between the two programs. 
The proposal reported by the committee honors that compromise: 57 percent of the savings are made in the guaranteed loan program and the remaining 43 percent come from direct lending. The amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts would destroy that balance. 
When filling in the detail of a broad compromise, there is always the urge to push further toward one's preference. What the Senator is attempting to do is therefore understandable. But, we need to recognize the amendment for what it is. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it.

If the chairman of the Finance Committee would give me his attention, as I read the unanimous consent request, States would not be able to use the new funds under the children's health insurance initiative to provide health care coverage under either the block grant or to provide Medicaid for children over 200 percent of poverty. 
This creates a real problem for a number of States. Vermont is currently covering all children aged 18 that have family incomes of 225 percent of poverty through its Medicaid Program. I would like to be assured that we will work to address this concern in the conference so that States have the ability to use the new funds to provide health care coverage for children over 200 percent of poverty. There are children above this level that need the help badly.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know it is too late for Chairman Roth to include this change in the manager's amendment, but I did want to raise it before we finish here today. 
As the chairman knows, thanks to a provision in both the Finance and Ways and Means packages, native Americans who are entitled to cross the U.S. border under the Jay Treaty are not affected by last year's welfare law restrictions on providing SSI to aliens. Unfortunately, due to jurisdictional considerations, neither the Finance nor the Ways and Means Committees included food stamps in this provision. Preliminary estimates indicate that such an inclusion would not incur significant cost. 
I understand Senator Lugar is supportive of the inclusion of food stamps and I hope the chairman and ranking member will work with me and other Members during conference with the House to include a food stamp modification.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, during the consideration of this important bill, I would like to bring to your attention developments regarding the administration's recently released SSI regulations for children. Through sections 211 and 212 of Public Law 104-193, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, Congress established a new eligibility test requiring that children show the presence of `marked and severe functional limitations' to become eligible for Supplemental Security Income [SSI] disability benefits. Additionally, under these new rules up to 300,000 children who are currently eligible for SSI will undergo a redetermination assessment over the next several months. 
On February 11, 1997, in an attempt to implement these provisions, the Social Security Administration issued interim final regulations that require a level of disability that meets or equals the listings of impairments criteria. As stated in a letter written by nine of my colleagues and me to the President in April, I believe this regulation establishes an overly severe standard that misinterprets the intent of Congress to reform the SSI program for children with disabilities. SSA's test would remove up to 135,000 SSI disabled children this year alone. Thus, thousands of severely disabled children would face a loss of needed SSI benefits--contrary to the will of Congress. 
I believe the Social Security Administration should establish a comprehensive functional test at a stricter severity level than the former individualized functional assessment test, but one that does not harm children with serious disabilities. A test protecting children with severely disabling conditions--including those with one marked and one moderate condition--would accurately reflect the intent of Congress. The administration has estimated this test would terminate 45,000 children this year, and close to 250,000 over 6 years. 
Mr. President, I have already heard from constituents in my State of Vermont whose children will soon lose their SSI benefits. These families have nowhere else to turn. Such predicaments present troubling moral and budgetary questions--how to provide for those families who are shut off from desperately needed SSI benefits, and whether these regulations will simply shift the costs of providing for children with disabilities from SSI to other Federal entitlement programs, or to the States as communities react to these troubling cases. Such cost shifting would eliminate any significant savings gained. Additionally, the loss of SSI benefits will force families to move their children to costly out-of-home placement, as parents would no longer have the financial support to stay at home and care for the disabled child. 
This is a matter that I will be pursuing with the Administration with the intent of reconciling the Administration's interpretation with the regulations passed by Congress during the welfare debate last fall.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a scaled-down, in fact, a way scaled-down version of an amendment that I offered in the Finance Committee markup. It failed on a very close vote, with the full amount of close to $900 million. This is an attempt to ensure that this next winter we do not have the kinds of emergencies we have faced with the inability to finance the school repairs necessary to keep the DC schools open. 
This amendment is to the provisions in the bill dealing with the District of Columbia. What this will do--hopefully, if accepted--is also place in the hands of those at the conference an amendment to help in the most critical area this city faces, and that is the decreasing capacity of its schools to even stand up, to keep the kids out of rain, and to protect the boilers from blowing up, and everything else. 
It is a modest start of only $70 million, but it will open a path, hopefully, that may be utilized in case these emergencies continue to increase. What it strikes is a provision in the bill that is only a $75 million provision. 
The provision that is in the bill attempts to set up some sort of tax credit system for businesses and people in the District of Columbia interested in having assistance in developing businesses. That is all very fine. I point out and emphasize again and again that that provision is in the House bill. So if mine does pass, it still will be in the committee of conference, and the members, then, will have a choice of whether they desire to try and protect the city schools from shutting down, or whether they prefer to use this provision with respect to tax credits. 
Let me give you the dimensions of the school problems in this city. First, very briefly, we have, for better or worse, one of the worst school systems in this country--and this is the Nation's Capital. I remind all of my colleagues that we have accepted responsibility for those schools. We have basically replaced the city council with the control board. We have replaced the school board with the board of trustees. We have given authority to the control board to basically run the city. Yet, the capacity of the city to do anything about its schools is greatly limited. Although they have substantial revenues, those revenues are critical and important to just keeping the schools open. They have $2 billion in necessary code repairs in order to make these schools up to code. 
Each year, we have had emergency appropriations to try and handle this situation. Those emergency appropriations have been in the terms of $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, $50 million a year. This is in an attempt to find a way to take care of those problems through the appropriations process in its normal form. 
I point out that these tax breaks that are included, which I will strike, really do nothing to bring middle-class families back to the District. The only thing that will bring families back to the District is a school system that will provide them with schools in which their children will learn something. We have one of the worst records, as far as our students go, of any city in the country. Without that, all the other things we try to do here will not bring back the middle-class families, unless we take care of the school system. 
I point out that Andrew Brimmer, chairman of the DC Control Board, says that the impact of the tax break provisions in this bill will do little or nothing. We must improve the schools and public safety. Let's get real in the efforts to help the city. Every week I travel the DC schools I see leaky faucets and roofs, broken boilers, and I could go on. The boilers are going to be the critical problem this next year. They are likely to shut the schools down in the middle of winter unless we do something. The students are suffering every day. 
All my amendment will do is allow the committee of conference to have another option, along with the one I am striking, in order to be able to take care of some of the emergency repairs for the schools. So, Mr. President, I also point out what has been lost and how we have hamstrung this city to do anything about it. The District has lost more than 200,000 residents since 1970; 200,000 people have moved out. And 50,000 have moved out in this decade alone. The only way to stem this tide is to improve the District services. 
There is a time and a place for tax breaks. Again, this is just putting another option on the table. But you don't offer tax breaks to attract residents back to a city where the schools are collapsing around them. That is like giving free popcorn to keep people in the seats in a burning theater. 
This isn't going to work. It is important that we do something about it. 
So, Mr. President, I want to make sure that we have an opportunity to give a seat to that conference committee for the kids in this city so that they may have a chance to see their schools restored to the point where this city can be proud of them and proud of their school system. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marlene `Molly' Burke of Rutland, VT. After 40 years of dedicated service to the teachers and students of Vermont, Molly has decided to retire. 
Molly began her distinguished career, inspired by her father, in 1956 at Pittsford High School when she was 22 years old. After a summer abroad, she taught at Essex Junction High School for a short while, then moved to Proctor High in 1959. In 1964, she began teaching at my alma matter, Rutland High, where she remained for three decades. Molly taught history in the classroom, however her interaction with her students did not end in the classroom. Molly coached cheerleading, and directed class plays as well. Her commitment to excellence and dedication to the students beyond normal classroom hours is in the finest tradition of Vermont's educational system. 
It was in recognition of her excellence that the Vermont teachers elected Molly president of the State chapter of the National Education Association in 1989. She moved to Montpelier where she headed the largest teachers union in Vermont because she believes that people should be treated fairly and equally and she made enormous efforts to improve the working conditions within all of Vermont's schools. 
Molly Burke embodies what all educators should strive to achieve. Once again, I would like to extend my thanks for her service to Vermont and best wishes in her retirement.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to address a problem that has enormous significance for the future of this Nation and the prosperity of our citizens. This legislation will create a regional Education and Workforce Training Partnership for the Washington Metropolitan Area. The partnership created in the Washington Metropolitan region would serve as a national model and would address the infrastructure crisis that exists in the District of Columbia Public Schools. Let me take a moment to explain the importance of this legislation as a national model. 
We face a national economic crisis if we fail to prepare our workforce for the high-paying technology jobs of the future. As a nation, we are currently enjoying an extended period of economic strength, and that is terrific. But we mustn't be lulled into a false sense of complacency. We have all read and digested the theory of how the foundation of our economy is shifting from a manufacturing base to what is now called the global knowledge economy. In the global knowledge economy, the ability to use critical thinking skills with advanced technology and information will be at a premium. Technology proficiency will be required to get and keep a good job. Now, I ask you, are we really prepared as a nation to be a leader in the global knowledge economy? Will our workers be surpassed by the workforces of our competitors overseas? 
At present there are 190,000 unfilled high-skilled information technology jobs at large and mid-sized U.S. companies. These vacancies are almost equally divided between information technology (IT) and non-IT companies that rely heavily on advanced technology skills to get the job done. This shows us, that as we approach the 21st century technology skills are a must. 
In the Washington Metropolitan Area alone there are at least 50,000 jobs--with an average annual salary of $40,000--that cannot be filled by the local labor market. Local area students are not being prepared to fill these jobs. Companies have complained to me in meeting after meeting that they are forced to recruit from other States or from other countries to try and find people for these positions--and that tactic is entirely too cost-prohibitive. 
The Metropolitan Washington Education and Workforce Training Improvement Act of 1997 authorizes the establishment of a regional education and work force training partnership. This partnership is to be composed of 13 members representing business and education, together with a government official from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. The partnership will chart a course for reforms and investments in education and work force training for the D.C. metropolitan area, making recommendations to the Secretaries of Education and Labor for grants to fund specific activities so that the skills of the regional work force will meet the needs of the regions employers. 
By filling the 50,000 IT jobs in the Washington metropolitan area an additional $3.5 billion annually would be injected into the region's economy. And, the partnership created by this legislation with its unique focus on business-education collaboration, would serve as a model for other regions in the Nation that are facing the same pending crisis in labor market shortage and economic development. 
In addition, this legislation will fulfill another long awaited promise that we as national leaders living and working in Washington must see through. I believe we have an obligation to make the Nation's Capital a model of what education must be as we enter the next century. The D.C. schools have made administrative progress recently, but the infrastructure problems are still appalling--requiring, according to a 1996 GSA report, an additional $2 billion for reconstruction and repair of dilapidated buildings. We must not let the students of the District of Columbia be sentenced to learning in buildings that would be found in a war zone. We owe more to the students of our Nation's Capital. 
I want to be clear that this legislation would provide initial Federal funding to help finance the bonding required to reconstruct the D.C. school infrastructure. No funds would be used towards the present school administration as they have adequate receipts. The legislation would also provide funding for the D.C. school reform legislation passed by the Congress last session. 
I want to see this Metropolitan Washington Education and Workforce Training Act enacted to help correct our regional labor market shortage and to serve as a model for the Nation. Through this legislation we can help fill the high-paying jobs we have available in this region, known as the Golden Crescent of Maryland, Virginia, and the District, and in so doing we will make our capital's education system one that is effective and one we can be proud of. I urge my colleagues to join me in this important effort.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to introduce the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1997 [ENDA]. As many of you recall, my colleagues and I introduced similar legislation in the last Congress. While we were unable to pass ENDA in the last Congress, I was encouraged that ENDA was only narrowly defeated, by a vote of 50 to 49. It is my hope that in the 105th Congress, we can bridge that narrow gap and pass this legislation. By extending to sexual orientation the same Federal employment discrimination protections established for race, religion, gender, national origin, age, and disability, this legislation will further ensure that principals of equality and opportunity apply to all Americans. 
I believe that all Americans deserve to be judged at work based on their ability to do their jobs and not their sexual orientation. People who work hard and perform well should not be kept from leading productive and responsible lives because of an irrational, non-work-related prejudice. Unfortunately, many responsible and productive members of our society face discrimination in their workplaces based on nothing more than their sexual orientation. Because this insidious discrimination persists, there is a need for Congress to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 
Mr. President, the Senate's vote last Congress is no doubt reflective of the American people's support of the concept behind ENDA. In a recent poll, 83 percent of the respondents support the passage of a law extending civil rights and preventing job discrimination against gays and lesbians. While ENDA will achieve this goal of equal rights for job opportunities, it does so by not creating any special rights for gays and lesbians. Specifically, this legislation prohibits preferential treatment based on sexual orientation. In addition, ENDA does not require an employer to justify a neutral practice that may have a statistically disparate impact based on sexual orientation, nor provide benefits for the same-sex partner of an employee. Rather, it simply protects a right that should belong to every American, the right to be free from discrimination at work because of personal characteristics unrelated to successful performance on the job. 
Since ENDA's narrow defeat last September, we have taken a fresh look at this important legislation in an attempt to allay some of the concerns raised by ENDA's detractors in the last Congress. I am pleased to announce that we have made several significant improvements in the bill. 
Our first change is intended to address the concern raised that employees' privacy rights would be violated if the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC] required employers to provide the Government with data on the sexual orientation of their employees. As a result, the bill now prohibits the EEOC from collecting such statistics and from compelling employers to do so. Opponents of the previous legislation were also concerned that the EEOC would require employers who have violated ENDA to hire gay and lesbian employees as part of its enforcement scheme. To alleviate that 
possibility, the new legislation precludes the EEOC from entering into a consent decree that includes quotas, or gives preferential treatment based on sexual orientation. In addition, we have narrowed the language of the previous bill so that only actual paid employees are protected and we have attempted to ensure that exempted religious organizations from coverage. 
In today's global economy, our Nation must take full advantage of every resource that is at our disposal if we want U.S. companies to maintain their competitive advantage over their international competitors. The fact that a majority of Fortune 500 companies have incorporated many of ENDA's policies, clearly indicates the acceptance of these changes within the workplace. In fact, it can be stated that without these American companies, on their own, undertaking these actions to insure adequate working protections for all of their employees they would be less competitive and may even be unable to maintain their existence within this fiercely competitive international environment. 
Mr. President, some concern has been raised by my colleagues that passing ENDA will create a new wave of litigation. I am proud to say that my home State of Vermont is one of several States and localities that have enacted a sexual orientation anti-discrimination law, and it is no surprise, to me, that the sky has not fallen. Since the enactment of Vermont's law in 1991 the Vermont Attorney General has initiated only 17 investigations of alleged sexual orientation discrimination. Seven are pending at this time. Five have been closed with determinations that unlawful discrimination cannot be proven to have occurred. Four have been closed for miscellaneous administrative reasons, unrelated to the merits of the charge, and one resulted in a settlement. In addition, I am not aware of a single complaint from Vermont employers about the enforcement of the State law. However, I do know that thousands of Vermonters no longer need to live and work in the shadows. The facts bear out my belief that the effect experienced in Vermont on litigation has been experienced in other States and the District of Columbia that have implemented policies similar to the one of my home State of Vermont. 
As I have stated before, success at work should be directly related to one's ability to do the job, period. The passage of ENDA would be a significant step toward ensuring the ability of all people, be they gay, lesbian, or heterosexual, to be fairly judged on their work product, not on an unrelated personal characteristic. I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues today in marking the 34th anniversary of President Kennedy's historic call for negotiations aimed at reducing the risk of nuclear war. 
President Kennedy's June 10, 1963, address at American University marked the beginning of serious international efforts to limit the nuclear arms race and to avert the nightmarish possibility of a nuclear war. His initiative resulted a few months later in the Limited Test Ban Treaty, which brought about the first pause in the nuclear powers' efforts to construct bigger, better, and more nuclear weapons. 
It's worth noting that President Kennedy's objectives were more ambitious. He had hoped to enact a comprehensive nuclear test ban, but was unable to win agreement for such a bold step. Now, more than three decades later, we have an opportunity to realize this objective. 
Following several years of negotiations in the U.N. Conference on Disarmament, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT] was completed and opened for signature in September 1996. Since then, over 140 countries have signed the document, including all five declared nuclear weapons states. For the treaty to enter into force, 44 key signatories, including the United States, must ratify the agreement prior to September 1998. 
Mr. President, over the past few years I have had the privilege of participating on a steering committee of a project organized by the Henry L. Stimson Center on Eliminating Weapons of Mass Destruction. The objective of the group, which included such authorities on foreign policy and national security as Gen. Andrew Goodpaster and Ambassador Paul Nitze, was to consider concrete measures the United States could undertake to work toward the long-term goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. In our third and final report, released in March, we laid out several steps President Clinton and Congress can take now to ensure that future generations are safe from the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. Ratification of the CTBT was one of the three most urgent measures we recommended. 
Enactment of a comprehensive test ban would do more to stem proliferation and reduce the nuclear threat than any other action we could take at this time. The details of the CTBT are technical and complex but the effect of the 
treaty is pure and simple: it would ban all nuclear test explosions. Not only would this constrain the development of more complex weapons but it would also protect our environment. 
The United States already has a moratorium in effect on nuclear weapons tests and has not conducted such a test since 1992. It's time to make this moratorium permanent and ensure that others follow suit. 
The administration has indicated its intent to present the CTBT to the Senate for advice and consent. However, to date it has not done so. I appreciate that the treaty is likely to be controversial in some quarters and that the Senate has only recently concluded a hotly contested debate on another important arms control treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC]. However, one of the problems we faced with the CWC was that it was not brought before the Senate as quickly as it could have been. For that and other reasons, we found ourselves in late April facing a deadline affecting our participation in the treaty. 
Let's not put ourselves in that position again. Let's begin the debate on the treaty now so that our decision on ratification--which I fervently hope will be a positive one--can serve as a signal of encouragement to other countries. 
Thirty-four years ago today, President Kennedy called on us to pause and consider the effects of a devastating nuclear conflict. He put us on a path to eliminating this threat. Let's honor his memory by fulfilling one of his grandest objectives. Let's act on and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we are now within 1,000 days of the new millennium, we need to begin to think about what our Nation should look like in the next 1,000 years. For in the last 1,000 years we have discovered new continents and new planets, we have conquered deadly diseases and created new technology. As we stand at the threshold of the next century we need to take the steps to prepare the Federal Government and all Americans for the path that lies ahead. 
This budget resolution is based on principles which are reasonable, credible, solution-oriented, and are based on common sense. It is because of those principles, Mr. President, that I rise today to support this bipartisan balanced budget resolution. For today we begin the process to bring fiscal security and greater economic opportunity to our children. 
For over 25 years, the Federal Government has been unable to balance the budget. We now owe more than $5.3 trillion. Therefore, we spend over $900 million on interest every day. We send more to our bondholders in 3 days than we do to every man, woman, and child in Vermont over the course of an entire year. 
The interest payment on our national debt is five and half times more than we spend on all education, job training, and employment programs combined. If one was to ask the question what should be the Federal priorities of this Nation? Should we spend more money on education for the future of this Nation, or more money on interest? Well, it is clear what our choice would be--education. Yet, we have precisely reversed our priorities because we have been imprudent with our fiscal policy. 
Balancing the budget is what we need to do to ensure a brighter future for America. Lower interest rates will allow American families to purchase their first home, send a child to college, and buy a new automobile. The real benefits of a balanced budget will be realized in the increased standard of living for each American family. 
Mr. President I would now like to take a moment to speak about some of the provisions in this agreement. 
Medicare serves a 37.5 million elderly and disabled individuals in this country. For several years the trustees of the Medicare program have continued to send notice to Capitol Hill that steps needed to be taken or this program will go bankrupt. This budget resolution keeps this program solvent for the next 10 years. We now can take the steps to make fundamental changes to preserve and strengthen Medicare for the current recipients and future generations. 
Through the effort of several of my colleagues, children's health was put in the forefront during these first few months of the 105th Congress. Senators came up with different proposals due to one fundamental thing--the need to provide health insurance to the estimated 10 million low income children. I commend both the administration and the leadership for realizing the importance of this issue and to providing the needed resources for these children. 
In many families today, both parents need to work in order to get by. They work in order to give their children a chance at a better future. Dinner tables in the past were filled with lively conversation. Conversation centering on discussions of values and goals and the other important issues which bring a family together. These tables are now silent. Empty tables due to the fact parents come home from work just too tired. 
It is time for we in Congress to take some steps to provide relief for the American family. The tax reduction package is not going to solve all the problems that each family faces in this country. But what it will do is leave some additional dollars in the pockets of our hard-working Americans in order for them to spend those funds on their family needs. As a member of the Finance Committee, I look forward to working with Chairman Roth on the specific provisions dealing with tax relief. 
One of the reasons I first got involved in public service was to make a difference in the educational system of our Nation. As chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee I feel that it is important that we continue to improve our school system. We have all read stories about children who go to class but just don't learn. Each day is a lost opportunity to shape and prepare these children for the future. A generation is leaving high school unable to meet the challenges that lay ahead. 
When a high school graduate is unable to read, what we find is that we sent an individual into the world who will live a life of missed opportunities. Every year America becomes a more technological country. Distances which used to be measured in the time it took for a plane travel across this country are now measured in the time it takes for a signal to be bounced off a satellite. Children need to graduate from high school not just able to read but to understand the changing nature of the workplace. 
Over my many years in Congress, I have championed educational opportunities for our children. This budget provides additional funding for programs that will help students throughout this Nation prepare for the future. Even though, for every dollar of increased spending for certain specific programs, this budget has made a $15 reduction in spending. Today we begin to prepare our students with greater educational opportunities and our Federal Government will lower deficit spending, both which will help meet the demands of a global economy. 
Mr. President, in closing, the American people in 1996 sent a message to our Nation's Capital. They wanted an administration and Congress of different political parties to work together to solve common problems. Though this agreement is not perfect, and there are some in this Chamber that feel that we have gone too far and some who feel we have not gone far enough, it is an important step forward. This is not a budget based on party, or one that was written exclusively in the Halls of Congress or in the Oval Office, this is a budget of compromise. This is a first step toward a new millennium. A time where America is going to need the ability to meet the challenges that lie ahead. 
I want to commend Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici and Majority Leader Lott for their determination, their hard work, and their vision in putting together this historic budget resolution. This is the first step to ensure a brighter tomorrow for our nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to modernize the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act for 5 years. This legislation comes as result of over 3 years of consideration by the Congress on steps that could be taken by the agency that would contribute to its mandate to protect the American public while ensuring that life-saving products could be made more readily available. 
FDA acknowledges that its mandate also requires it to regulate over one-third of our Nation's products. Within its purview the FDA regulates virtually all of the food and all of the cosmetics, medical devices, and drugs made available to our citizens. I believe, and several members of the Labor Committee share my belief, that in an organization the size of FDA there is always room for improvement and modernization. Our objective, which this legislation achieves, was identify areas where improvements could be made that will strengthen the agency's ability to approve safe and effective products more expeditiously. 
Last year, both the House and the Senate held numerous and extensive hearings on countless proposals for modernizing and reforming the FDA. The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee successfully reported a bipartisan bill that sought to accomplish many of those reforms. But last year, acrimonious issues remained, time ran out and the bill did not receive floor consideration. This year I have resolved to move forward. I have been committed to addressing last year's most controversial issues. I believe that the legislation I am introducing today addresses virtually all of objections raised last year both in process and in content. This is a better bill and I believe that upon examination, my colleagues will agree that it accomplishes its goal. 
I want to comment a moment on the open, consensus-building process we followed in developing this legislation. The Labor Committee held two hearings. During the first the committee received testimony from the principal FDA Deputy Commissioner, Dr. Michael Friedman, and all of the FDA Center Directors. The second hearing included representatives from patient and consumer coalitions and from the food, drug, and medical device sectors regulated by the FDA. Committee members learned from the agency of the administrative reforms and the progress it has already undertaken, areas that remain a challenge, and those areas that require legislative authority to change. The committee listened to consumers' concerns with provisions that were considered last year that they felt would weaken the FDA's ability to protect the public health. Finally, the committee learned of the ongoing and needless delays and frustrations facing health care and consumer product sectors of our economy in working with the FDA. The committee learned of the frustrated attempts to work through the bureaucratic labyrinth of needless regulatory delays. Delays that prohibited people from getting access to vitally needed, life saving medical treatments, drugs, and devices. 
Since the finish of the committee's hearings we have engaged in an open, collaborative process that has given voice to each party wishing to be heard. For many of these meetings it is worth noting that the agency was a full, cooperating participant and we would not have been able to make the progress made without FDA's collaboration. Several meetings, essentially roundtable discussions, have occurred with bipartisan committee staff, the FDA, and each of the several sectors regulated by the agency. These meetings have given all the participants an opportunity to discuss problems and potential solutions and have been the basis for the consensus bill I am introducing today. Finally, committee staff have had numerous meetings to discuss key provisions in the bill with a wide range of consumer groups including, among others, the Patient Coalition, Public Citizen, the Centers for Science in the Public Interest, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the National Organization for Rare Diseases. It should be clear that no person or group was excluded from this deliberative process. 
Let me turn to the content of this measure and the steps we have taken to respond to the controversies raised last year. Five key objections were raised against the FDA reform bill that had been reported on a strong bipartisan vote from the Labor and Human Resources Committee during the last Congress. In that vein, we have sought to and have accomplished addressing each of the substantive concerns raised by the minority. 
Last year's measure was criticized by some for the number of mandatory, but shortened, product review time frames that critics said would overburden the FDA and for the hammers that would have required FDA to contract out some product reviews or to give priority to products approved abroad. Today's legislation eliminates most of the mandatory time frames and retains only those necessary to ensure collaborative, more efficient reviews or to facilitate quick reviews of low risk products. The contracting out and European review hammers that would have forced FDA actions have been eliminated. 
Last year's provision allowing for third party, outside expert review were criticized for turning central regulatory authority decisions over to private industry, creating conflicts of interest, and depriving FDA of resources and expertise. Today's legislation adopts FDA's current system for accrediting and selecting third-party review organizations. The bill expands FDA's current pilot third-party review program beyond just the lowest risk devices and FDA retains final approval for all devices. Devices that are life-supporting, life-sustaining, or implantable are excluded from third-party review. FDA may allow third-party review for higher risk devices at its sole discretion. This approval will allow FDA to retain, augment, and focus its expertise, at its discretion, on critical areas of its expanding workload. 
Last year's bill would have required FDA to contract out review of food additive petitions, medical devices, and drugs. Critics argued these changes would weaken consumer protections. We have modified these provisions to give FDA express authority to contract out when deemed by FDA to be more efficient or to add needed expertise. 
Thsi year the collaborative effort has continued. During our meetings FDA identified a number of enforcement powers that the agency believes will enhance its ability to protect the public health. We have included a number of FDA's specific requests. Many patient and consumer groups raised concerns about insufficient safeguards related to the fast-track drug approval process and the provision improving accelerated access to investigational products and we have adopted several of their key concerns. 
I would close by saying that this measure embodies a reasonable, moderate approach to balancing the agency's mandate to regulate over one-third of our Nation's economy and provide for the public health and safety with the compelling need to provide new, improved, safe, and effective products to the American public. It is a good bill and I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve it even further.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to six outstanding young women who are being presented with the Girl Scout Gold Award by the Vermont Girl Scout Council. They are Melissa Jones and Tina Newell of Vergennes, Kathleen Lomedico of Colchester as well as Jennifer Tobin, Vincenza Tortolano, and Lori Brown of Rutland. They are being honored on May 29, 1997 for earning the highest achievement award in U.S. Girl Scouting. 
The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14-17, or in grades 9-12. To receive the award, these Girl Scouts first earned four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge as well as designing and implementing a Girl Scout Gold Award project to meet a special need in their communities. 
As members of the Vermont Girl Scout Council, Melissa and Tina first earned badges in understanding yourself and others, child care, games, creative writing, and reading. The girls then combined their efforts in a project to combat illiteracy. They designed a series of three workshops for young children about the magic of books which they put on at their local town library. The workshops featured a magician, hired with money the girls raised themselves, magic tricks and crafts taught by the girls, and wonderful stories featuring magic. They attracted a large number of youngsters. The girls reported `everything we did interested and excited the children; they wanted to read more books and they now know the library and are planning to come to their future children's programs'. 
Jennifer and Vincenza put their efforts into making a special place for some elderly members of their community. The girls designed and established a conversation garden to give nursing home residents and their guests access to sidewalks, shade, and beauty, putting in two settees and planting bulbs and a flowering crabapple tree, all financed by the girls' sale of handmade cookbooks. To quote the nursing home administrator, `these two young people have earned the respect and appreciation of 125 nursing home residents and 160 employees of Eden Park'. 
As a member of the Vermont Girl Scout Council, Lori first earned badges in child care, reading, music, games, well being and understanding yourself and others. She then used these skills to design and implement a series of Lenten workshops for the younger children in her parish church. Kathleen earned badges in artistic crafts and exploration among others. After learning leadership skills through Girl Scouting, she served as the editor of her high school yearbook. As her Girl Scout Gold Award project she spent the last year organizing and leading a youth group for teens which meets every other week and a youth band which plays every Sunday for her church parish. Kathleen wanted the young people in her parish to `feel a sense of home in the church.' Both girls used the skills they learned in Girl Scouting to help the church of their faith. 
These six Senior Girl Scouts have earned my respect and admiration. I believe all the girls should receive the public recognition due them for such significant services to their communities and their country.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Franklin `Bill' Billings on the occasion of his 75th birthday. In addition, I would like to take this opportunity and commemorate his distinguished service as a Federal judge. 
Bill's career has been dedicated to serving the people of Vermont in a wide array of positions. He first served the Green Mountain State as assistant secretary of the Senate from 1949 to 1953. He was later selected to represent the Woodstock area as a member of the Vermont House. During his tenure, Bill was elected speaker of the Vermont General Assembly in 1963 and 1965, which were tumultuous reapportionment years for the State. In 1975, he was appointed to the Vermont Supreme Court and subsequently chosen to serve as Chief Justice. He concluded his career as the U.S. district court judge for the district of Vermont. 
Throughout his efforts, Bill has remained consistently committed to standards of professionalism above reproach as well as an unwavering respect and dedication to ethics. His uncanny ability to see beyond the surface, while considering some of the most complicated legal matters, is testimony to a keen intellect. 
Once again, I would like to extend my best wishes and congratulations to Judge Bill Billings. He has set an example which we should all strive to emulate.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the children of America need our help. Nearly 10 million children have no health insurance. Many of these children live in families with working parents who simply do not make enough money to afford health insurance. 
In order to help address this national problem, I have cosponsored both the Hatch-Kennedy CHILD Act and the Children's Health Insurance Provides Security [CHIPS] Act. The CHILD Act would establish a State health insurance grant program and the CHIPS Act encourages States to provide uniform Medicaid coverage up to 150 percent of poverty for children of all ages. The combination of these two bills provides an integrated approach to ensuring that our Nation's uninsured children have health care coverage and does so in a way that is completely consistent with the policy language in the budget agreement. 
I have serious concerns, however, that $16 billion is an insufficient amount to meet the health insurance needs of the 10 million uninsured children. I, therefore, will support raising an additional $20 billion through a cigarette tax. I believe using an increased cigarette tax as the revenue source is especially appropriate since it will have the added health benefit of helping to deter children from starting to smoke in the first place. 
If the Hatch-Kennedy amendment does not pass, I will continue to work with my colleagues to develop a multifaceted approach that has as its first priority the strengthening of the existing Medicaid Program.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill along with Senator Kohl and several of my colleagues which will amend the earned-income credit to restore fairness to low-income dairy farmers across the country. 
Last year during the debate over welfare reform, Congress tightened up on the requirements for eligibility for the EIC. The law was amended to prevent taxpayers with investment assets from claiming the EIC, our rationale being that taxpayers with substantial investment assets should sell those assets rather than rely on the EIC to supplement their income. Specifically, the law now reads that if you have over $2,200 in disqualified income, you cannot claim the EIC. 
The earned-income credit (EIC) is a credit against tax available to low-income working taxpayers. The credit is refundable; in other words, even if you don't owe any income tax, the Government may still give you a refund. In this way, the credit is a kind of income assistance to low-income taxpayers, encouraging them to keep working. 
Mr. President, the problem lies in that the IRS has interpreted the term disqualified income to include gains realized by dairy farmers when they cull and sell cows no longer suitable for dairy farming. I disagree with the IRS' interpretation, as do many of my colleagues. In my view, culled dairy cows are not investment assets. When farmers cull and sell cows no longer fit for dairy farming, they're not cashing in on their investments. To the contrary, they're cutting their losses. And we should not automatically expect proceeds from these sales to be available to support the farmer's day-to-day living expenses. Farmers may not be able to use this money to put food on his or her family's table or clothing on his family's back. He or she may have to pump these funds back into the dairy operation. If the farmer intends to maintain a viable dairy farm, he or she may use proceeds from the sale of a culled cow to acquire another cow suitable for dairy farming. So, I think it is wrong that these sale proceeds should make the low-income dairy farmer ineligible for the EIC. 
The IRS' interpretation will result in the loss of income from thousands of struggling dairy farmers across the country. Dairy farmers have experienced a 25-percent decline in milk prices in recent months and for years have been faced with unstable and low milk prices. Based on the Farm Credit's analysis, the current IRS position would cost Vermont dairy farmers nearly $1 million in refunds and/or increased tax bills. Dairy farmers across the country will be adversely impacted by the current position of the IRS. The greatest impact will be in States that have a high number of small- and mid-sized family dairy operations. Losses to the Nation's dairy farmers have been estimated to be as much as $76 million. 
In short, in my view, when the income generated by a farmer's dairy operations is otherwise modest, he or she should not become ineligible for the EIC when he or she has the misfortune to discover that some of his or her dairy cows are nonproductive and disposes of those nonproductive assets at a profit. 
Because I disagree with the IRS interpretation, I, together with 16 colleagues, wrote to IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson on March 13, 1997, to challenge the IRS interpretation of the EIC. Unfortunately, the IRS has maintained that its interpretation is correct. Accordingly, today I am introducing this bill, along with several of my colleagues, to overturn what we believe is an unwise and unwarranted interpretation by the IRS. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with great reluctance I rise in opposition to the amendment. I do so only because, with the necessities of education, we have to establish certain priorities. There is no question but that rebuilding the infrastructure is an important priority. But there are others that at this particular time I think have to take priority. 
I do appreciate, for instance, in the city of Washington this body, Congress, has a certain obligation to restore the schools. That is about $2 billion that we are going to have to find a way to fund in order to bring this city back to where it ought to be. 
On the other hand, there is somewhere around $120 billion in infrastructure repairs necessary in this country. How we get that I do not know. I do know that $5 billion would start it, but there are other priorities--and I will tick off a number of those priorities--for which we could use these resources better. 
First of all, as the body probably knows, I voted in favor of expanding the amount of money that will be available by supporting the Hatch-Kennedy bill. If that money were available, it might tend to change my position. But when I look out there right now, our most immediate needs are trying to get the educational system in order to provide the kind of skilled labor we need in this Nation. That means we have to change the K through 12 programs by professional development in order to give us the math standards we need in order to provide the skilled labor force. This is going to take a considerable amount of immediate resources. 
In addition to that, getting our schools up to speed with respect to the technical aspects of computers and other means of being able to improve access to modern technology, to improve the schools, would take about $16 billion. In addition to that, it would take about $8 billion a year to keep them up to snuff. 
Another area we have to deal with is higher ed as well. We already know that we have incredible problems in that respect. Most importantly are worker training areas. Right now, in order to provide the work force for the future, we have to find ways to, first of all, provide sufficient additional remedial help so that our young people who graduate will be ready to go to work in skilled labor. We do not have those resources yet. 
We will be passing out a worker training bill, and we will be needing resources in order to do that. We have created another huge priority in this Nation, and that is taking the welfare people who are involved in receiving benefits, to train them and retrain them in order to have jobs. That is incredibly important, and it has to be done. That is going to take other billions of resources. 
So although I sympathize with the amendment, I strongly believe the resources at this time that we do have available would have to be placed in slightly different order than would enable us to try to take care of the huge backlog and which has traditionally been accepted as the responsibility by the State and local governments. For those reasons, Mr. President, I oppose the amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, so I do not sound totally inconsistent with the arguments I just made, I would let it be known that I intend to withdraw my amendment at the conclusion of my statement. 
I rise today with my good friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, to offer this motion. What this does is to remove the reconciliation instructions from the budget bill, the reconciliation instructions of my own committee. The reason for that is that this would require us to reduce the aid for our higher ed students. 
I would remind everyone that last year this body greatly reduced the instructions then of some many billions of dollars and sent it over to the House. They came back and refused to go along. And this body voted 99 to 0 to insist upon the Senate's position. That resulted in restoring almost all of the money to the higher ed area. 
The only area that my committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, has any money that is in the reconciliation area is with respect to the higher ed funding of our student loans. The budget agreement as recently written cuts the student financial aid account by $1.8 billion over 5 years. I would note that that is substantially lower than last year. We end up, even after all the reductions from about $19 billion down, we still ended up with $4 billion. So I commend the Budget Committee for coming back with half of what was required last year. 
Our motion would restore these funds however and remain budget neutral by providing for adjustment on the revenue side of the agreement. I think it is important to remind my colleagues of the central importance that student aid plays in our children's future. 
The balanced budget agreement is dependent upon increases in working productivity and in future economic growth. This growth in turn is dependent upon the quality and availability of a well-educated work force. 
Let us take a minute to reflect on the facts regarding the economic impact, the higher education impact upon Federal aid to student participation. Participation in higher education is one of the most dramatic predictors of economic success. 
As you can see from this chart--the chart I would have had but do not have--that shows dramatically that the more education you have, the more economic availability you have. 
With a high school degree, your high range is at $43,000. If you have a bachelor's degree, it is $73,000. And if you have a doctorate, it goes well above that. 
In the past years, only those that had postsecondary education have been able to stay even with the cost of living. And only those with doctorates and masters degrees have improved their standard of living. 
So it is incredibly important we provide the access of our young people to go to higher education. The postsecondary, as I referred to it now--we have given much emphasis on the higher education without keeping in mind the postsecondary training education that is available. 
Federal financial aid plays an essential role in allowing students from low and middle income families to attend community colleges and universities. Thirty-six percent of all students receive some form of Federal financial aid in order to allow them to attend college. This Federal investment is returned many times over in increased economic productivity and income in Federal taxes. Without this aid, however, many of the students would not be able to fulfill their dreams to attend college.

I would again ask Members to keep in mind the 99 to 0 vote which occurred last year that said we should not do anything that impacts in the ability of our students to attend higher education. So I will ensure that the reconciliation that we send, if anything, will make sure that it does not in any way hinder the ability of students to attend higher education. 
I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my motion at this time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we will vote on the legislation offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] to ban the dilation and extraction, or D&X, procedure used by doctors. I will be voting against this ban for the third time in as many years. 
My reasons for opposing this legislation are many. Most have been discussed on the floor since the debate began last week. First, and most importantly I believe that this bill undermines the Supreme Court's decision in Roe versus Wade to leave these critical matters in the hands of a woman, her family, and their doctor. The pending legislation is an effort to chip away at these reproductive rights established in that 1973 decision and upheld by court cases since 1973. I understand many people disagree with my position. This issue has been contentious since I came to Congress in 1975. 
Second, with the Roe decision, the Supreme Court wisely gave States the responsibility to restrict third-trimester abortions, so long as the life or health of the mother were not jeopardized. As of 1997, all but nine States have done so. To me, the rights of States to regulate abortions, when the life or health of the mother are not in danger, is an adequate safeguard. In the event the States pass unconstitutional regulations on this point, the appropriate remedy is with the courts. I realize that this policy leads to differences in law from State to State, but just as families differ, so too do States. As I said during debate on this topic in 1995: 
When the Roe versus Wade decision acknowledged a state interest in fetuses after viability, the Court wisely left restrictions on post-viability abortions up to states. There are expert professional licensing boards, accreditation councils and medical associations that guide doctors' decision-making in the complicated and difficult matters of life and death. 
Nothing has changed since then. My reasons for voting against Senator Daschle's substitute amendment last week included this very principle: That Congress should not restrict those reproductive health decisions made by a woman and her doctor. 
Third, the legislation before us would prevent doctors from using the D&X procedure where it is necessary to save the life of the mother. This clearly goes against the holding of the Supreme Court in Roe, as it required the health of the mother be safeguarded when States regulate late-term abortions. I will not vote for a bill that is neither constitutional, nor takes into account those situations where carrying a fetus to term would cause serious health risk for the mother. This is simply unacceptable. My vote in favor of the Feinstein substitute amendment underscored my commitment to safeguarding a doctor's options to protect the health of the mother in cases where a late-term procedure is necessary. 
Finally, I believe that women who choose to undergo a D&X procedure do so for grave reasons. If there are women who abort to fit into their prom dress, I trust the States to regulate these incidents--if they do, in fact, occur. We have established a delicate legal framework in which to address late-term abortions and we should not shift the decisionmaking to the Federal Government.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will resume consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Under the previous order, at approximately 10 a.m., the Senate will vote on a motion to invoke cloture on S. 4. Following that vote, there will be a period for morning business until the hour of 11 a.m. to accommodate a number of the Senators who have requested time to speak. In addition, I remind all Members that they have until 10 a.m. to file second-degree amendments to S. 4. 
Also, by previous order, at 11 a.m., the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 1122, the partial-birth abortion ban bill, with Senator Feinstein recognized to offer an amendment. Debate on the Feinstein amendment will last until approximately 2 p.m., with the time equally divided between Senator Feinstein and Senator Santorum. At approximately 2 p.m., a rollcall vote will occur on, or in relation to, the Feinstein amendment. 
Following the disposition of the Feinstein amendment, Senator Daschle will be recognized to offer his amendment to H.R. 1122, and under a consent agreement, there will be 5 hours of debate in order equally divided between Senator Daschle and Senator Santorum. Therefore, Senators can anticipate a vote on, or in relation to, the Daschle amendment later this evening. Consequently, Members can expect rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate. As always, Senators will be notified with as much notice as possible as to the exact time of these ordered votes. 
The majority leader reminds all Members that next week, as the last week prior to the Memorial Day recess, as Senators are aware, we have a number of important issues which we hope to complete action on prior to the recess, including the budget resolution, any conference reports that are available and any executive nominations that can be cleared. Therefore, the majority leader appreciates the cooperation of all Members in the scheduling of legislative business and votes next week. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention and yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will very brief. 
All of the arguments that have been given here against the Family Friendly Workplace Act are based on one fact: that an employer who is a real SOB is not going to give his or her employees the rights created in this bill. 
Why deny the 99.9 percent of the employees in this Nation who have good employers the ability to work these things out with their employers? 
So all of the arguments against S. 4 are based on one thing; that employers will not follow the provisions contained in the bill. The point is, Mr. President, that S. 4 contains provisions that will protect American workers. Since the bill does contain these protections, and 99.9 percent of employees work for good employers, it is completely unfair to deny all of the rest of the employees in the country the ability to participate in comptime, flex-time and bi-weekly work schedules. 
Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I wish to speak in strong opposition to the amendment. I understand the emotionalism that has gone on in our States throughout this Nation over the years, and even up to the point that we speak, about the problems that were created, and which the Senator from Washington is attempting to address. 
I point out, first of all, that the bill tries its best to preserve the order in the classroom through uniform policies for all school districts, and to ensure that every child with a disability is treated fairly, but also balances the needs of those in the classroom to have a safe and peaceful, shall we say, learning environment. That is done. The House voted yesterday with only three dissenting votes on this bill, recognizing that those kinds of balances had been reached after an incredible effort on the part of so many to give us a bill that everyone who is deeply involved in this issue can agree with. 
I know this body respects the order that is necessary in the classroom and also the ability of local schools to be able to try and accommodate the interests of all, but I believe this bill, by doing this, what it says is, `notwithstanding any other provision of this act, each State, educational agency or local educational agency may establish and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline and order.' 
Now, what does that mean? I do not know. But if it means what it says, it wipes out everything. It would be contrary to what they want to do. That means we could have thousands or hundreds of different ideas on how to bring order to the classroom. It would set back the system. 
I know the Senator from Washington speaks sincerely, and I know that Washington had a terrible problem, initially, in the early parts of this decade. Almost half the cases, I believe, went to due process hearings and ended up in court. However, this past year, 96 percent of those cases that were heard in mediation were solved and did not go to court. So his own State, I think, has solved the problems he is trying to deal with. 
I hope Members would not vote for this amendment. At the appropriate time I will move to table it. This would create havoc in the whole system.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, very quickly, the balance has been reached in this bill. The most critical question is, what can you do with the dangerous child? It is very simple: If it is not a matter involved with the disability, that child could be disciplined like any other child. If it is related to the disability, as determined by a hearing officer, then there can be up to 45 days removal in an appropriate educational setting. If the problem still exists and the school can demonstrate that the child may be substantialy likely to cause harm to himself or others, the child will remain in an interim alternative educational setting for an additional 45 days, et cetera--tremendous balance, tremendous help to the present situation.

Last year we came almost to the point where we passed a bill similar to this for the disabled community and for the schools. It broke down at the last minute because there was dissension over one issue. You have had your opportunity this time to show your concern about how the bill goes, but if we have one amendment, then it has to go back and there are those out there now who want to disrupt it. Senator Lott and Dave Hoppe spent hundreds of hours to bring these communities together to agree on this bill which is a tremendous step forward. If you vote no on the motion to table, you could kill this bill and we could start over again.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their tolerance. This is an incredibly important piece of legislation that will do so much to straighten out the problems that we have with respect to special education in our schools. It allows much more flexibility in discipline in the schools. It takes care of the numerous problems that we have had. 
I will point out that Senator Lott and Dave Hoppe spent an infinite number of hours bringing these groups together. Senator Frist did so much last year to prepare us, but it fell apart at the last minute. Senator Coats also worked very hard on this. 
I commend all colleagues for their support. I point out that this passed the House yesterday 420 to 3. I hope we can do even better on this side. I thank all the staff who have helped us. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for the tremendous vote and support for the legislation. This has been an incredible endeavor: So much effort, so much time. The vote that we have is certainly, percentagewise, perhaps at least identical to the House, and certainly with only one dissenting vote is a tremendous tribute to all those who worked to put this bill together. 
In particular, I wish to thank Senator Frist, who brought it almost to this point last year, and it fell apart at the last minute. His efforts were so paramount in bringing this bill to us this year. 
I thank the majority leader and Dave Hoppe for their help in getting all the groups together, and thank as well the work of both sides of the aisle, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, all on my side, certainly Senator Coats and, as I mentioned, Senator Frist and Senator Lott, and all who have worked so hard--Senator Gregg in particular on the funding--this past year. We have had a real joint effort. And I am blessed and thank Pat Morrissey and Jim Downing of my staff who also did tremendous work, and also the staff on the majority side and the minority side. 
I yield to Senator Harkin.

I think for those of us who were involved in the original writing of it back in 1975, I think only we, perhaps, had the legal understanding of what has happened over the last 20-odd years now as to improving the lives of individuals with disabilities and to improve the confidence of our educational system in giving an appropriate education to all our students. 
I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Thank you, Senator. 
Mr. President, last evening the House adopted H.R. 5 by a recorded vote of 420 to 3. Today we have voted 98-1. In the last week Congress has demonstrated once again, its willingness to invest in human capital--the children of today and the taxpayers of tomorrow, children with disabilities and children, who, if not helped, might develop disabilities. We have said in H.R. 5: children with disabilities will continue to receive a free appropriate public education, we do expect them to succeed in the general education curriculum, and we will be accountable for their progress. That is a clear, simple message, a message of power, potential, and promise. 
We invested in human capital in another way in H.R. 5. We recognized the range of decisions and obligations that fall to local school districts on a daily basis. We gave them flexible, practical guidelines on how and when they may discipline children with known disabilities. We gave them greater access to Federal dollars and greater discretion in how those dollars may be used. We directed more resources to personnel preparation and to technical assistance. We reshaped procedural requirements so school personnel may concentrate on children and teaching them. 
We invested in human capital through incentives for partnership between State educational agencies and local education agencies, and between parents and professionals. These partnerships will not only foster cooperative planning and problem solving, but innovation and expanded opportunities for children, with and without disabilities, to benefit from school. 
The process by which we arrived here today, for this vote, may be unprecedented and never be repeated, but it allowed us to achieve a consensus on a fundamental point. All children are entitled to a good education, we reaffirm that, and make it more likely for children with disabilities in H.R. 5. 
Although others may characterize our efforts differently, I would say that we were guided by the premise that special education is not a place but an attitude. It is an attitude that says children need not fail in order to be helped; that communication and partnership with parents is a commitment, not an accident; and that solutions to problems do not come from mandates, but from reaching common ground. 
I wish to thank my colleagues for their support in the passage of this historic legislation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank everyone who has worked so hard to bring S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, to the floor. In particular, I would like to recognize the efforts and hard work of Senator Mike DeWine, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, and Senator John Ashcroft, the author and original sponsor of the bill. I am especially gratified to be working with Senators Ashcroft and DeWine on this important bill. 
We are here today because we share the belief that S. 4 could make a world of difference in the lives of millions of Americans. During the markup of S. 4, a number of issues were brought to the committee's attention by my esteemed colleagues in the minority. At that time, Senator DeWine and I committed to look into several of the issues that were raised and to resolve them to the extent practicable. In the days following the markup, I have worked closely with Senator DeWine and other Members to address these issues. I am extremely pleased with the results of this process. I believe that the changes proposed in the committee amendment will result in an even stronger piece of legislation. The Senator from Ohio will discuss the changes that have been made in the committee substitute to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
After spending a great deal of time working with the language of this bill and the committee amendment, I am more convinced than ever that S. 4 will assist American workers to balance work and family, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment of the Senator from the State of Washington. I can understand his particular concern, given that the State of Washington at one time had the highest percentage of due process hearings that resulted in court cases of any State in the country. I would note that the State has taken dramatic action in the last couple of years which has greatly reduced the amount of litigation. 
But first of all, let me talk about the word `mandate,' as it is used not only the Senator from Washington but also by many others. The indication is that IDEA somehow is a Federal mandate. 
Back in the early seventies, there were many court cases and some 26 States were told that they must provide an appropriate education for children with disabilities. In order to provide national uniformity, a national consent decree was developed. The decree provided that, if a State provides for a free education, then it must provide it for everyone and, with respect to students with disabilities, it must provide a free and appropriate education. Part of the definition of `appropriateness' were the words `shall contain mainstream provisions,' or words to that effect. 
It is not just an issue of court cases in those States. This is a constitutional matter--a matter of equal protection. 
Congress responded by developing a bill that provided uniformity and attempted to provide information, guidelines, and rules for the States as to how to provide an appropriate education consistent with mainstreaming. It is amazing that, since that bill was written in 1975, there have been no amendments to it other than the 1986 amendments which dealt with other matters, such as early intervention as well as attorney's fees. I hope that sets the background with respect to where we are today. 
Now let me talk about the cost of this education. Yes, it is costly. It costs right around $35 billion a year, of which the Federal Government provides only a relatively small amount, some 7 percent to 8 percent. The Gregg amendment, which has already been offered, attempts to rectify our failure to provide the 40 percent we promised back in 1975, but that is another issue. 
The Republican education bill, S. 1, delineates a path toward living up to our promise to finance 40 percent of the cost of this education. I hope we do carry out that plan. At the same time, I do not believe we should add any amendments on that issue at this time. 
What will the Gorton amendment do? If you talk about lawsuits, if you talk about lawyer's fees, it is a bonanza. This proposal may take care of some of the less than fully employed lawyers around the country. We have 16,000 school districts and, under this amendment, we would have 16,000 sets of rules. It will take us a long time to figure out what that means--which ones do you use and where do you go? Senate bill 717 sets specific rules for everybody across the country, so every State has uniformity. Therefore, I think contrary to the desire of the Senator from Washington, his amendment will exacerbate the problem rather than solve it. 
Also, I would like to point out, as to the total cost, you have to consider that it is a constitutional mandate, so it is a necessary cost. It is not something which was added in order to 
try and benefit some people. This is a constitutional mandate. If you measure those costs and you compare them with the savings that have occurred by virtue of providing this education, then you will come up with a totally different picture. 
All of us have observed in our States what has happened. Almost all the institutions which used to house children with disabilities, children who were not able to function in our society, have been closed in Vermont. Even those children who have a particularly difficult time, those who are less educable, are in private foster homes. Millions and millions of dollars have been saved in our State by that alone. 
Second, there is the issue of the quality of life of individuals who are able to participate in a school system and are able to have functional lives and be employed. There is story after story after story of young people who have come through the system and become an important part of society--employed and paying their own way. To say that the cost is so high, this amendment will do nothing but increase the cost. 
As I indicated earlier, I understand the concern of the Senator from Washington. In 1993, the State of Washington had 72 hearings, 26 of which resulted in court cases. The State of California, on the other hand, had 849 hearings requested--only 10 of which resulted in court cases. 
The State of Washington recognized that they had to make some changes, and they did. They implemented a process of getting people together to talk these things over and find a resolution, and the figures have changed abruptly. They now have a lot of mediation proceedings and few, if any, court cases. In 1995 and 1996, there were 137 mediations in the State of Washington, with 6 pending at the end of the year. Just about all of the cases were settled. During that same period, only three hearings were held. 
In view of these improvements, I urge the Senator from Washington to withdraw his amendment. I hope we can take a look at what could happen. If this amendment passes, it would destroy a system which has apparently been working very well and would put us in a position where we would be back to court in about every case. 
I hope that the Senator will end this instead of creating a problem which would destroy all of the efforts that the State of Washington has made in the last few years to get rid of the problems they had.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me discuss the bill and what it does to take care of these situations. Senate bill 717 provides one set of rules with discretion for school districts and protection for children. 
The Gorton amendment, if passed, will kill the bipartisan, bicameral consensus that this measure enjoys. We simply cannot destroy all the work that has gone on throughout this country in bringing us the bill we have today--we all remember what happened last year when we thought we had a consensus. Issues similar to those raised by the Senator from Washington came up, and the whole thing fell apart. We cannot let that happen again. 
If the Gorton amendment were to pass, school districts would get no relief. All the major educational organizations support S. 717, and they would all oppose this amendment. 
Let me lay out a rationale of how we approach the sensitive issue of handling the discipline problems. Educators and parents need, deserve, and--in fact--have asked for the codification of major Federal policy governing how and when a child with a disability may be disciplined by removal from his or her current educational placement. 
The bill takes a balanced approach to discipline. It recognizes the need to maintain safe schools and the same need to preserve the civil rights of children with disabilities. 
This bill brings together, for the first time, in the statute the rules that apply to children with disabilities who are subject to disciplinary action and clarifies for school personnel, parents, and others how school disciplinary rules and the obligation to provide a free, appropriate education fit together. The bill provides specificity about important issues such as whether educational services can cease for a disabled child--they cannot--how manifestation determinations are made, what happens to a child with disabilities during the parent appeals, and how to treat children not previously identified as disabled. 
We have gone through all that and we worked hard all across the country. We have a consensus on this very difficult issue, one that has been the most contentious for several years. We now have an agreement on how to handle it. 
When a child with a disability violates school rules or codes of conduct through possession of weapons, drugs, or demonstration of behavior that is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others in the school, the bill provides clear and simple guidance about educators' areas of discretion, the parents' role, and the procedural protections for the child. The Gorton amendment would say to a town or a school district that they could throw all this out and put its own in. 
Dangerous children can be removed from their current educational placement. Specific standards must be met to sustain any removal. If a behavior that is subject to school discipline is not a manifestation of the child's disability, the child may be disciplined the same as children without disabilities. So, that group which has been troublesome certainly is treated just like any other child. If parents disagree with the removal of their child from his or her current educational placement, they can request an expedited due process hearing. If educators believe that the removal of a child from his or her educational placement must be extended, they can ask for an extension in an expedited due process hearing. So there is a process to make sure that no child who is dangerous is forced on the other children in the classroom. 
The bill allows school personnel to move a child with disabilities to an interim, alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if that student has brought a weapon to school or a school function or knowingly possesses or uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale of a controlled substance while at school or at a school function. 
The bill gives school personnel the option of requesting that a hearing officer move a child with a disability to an interim, alternative educational setting for up to 45 days if the child is 
substantially likely to injure themselves or others in their current placement. 
I commend the Senator from Washington. He worked so hard last year to make us aware of the need to change this. We took into consideration his advice and counsel. We came up with a version which everybody in the country has agreed to. Why does he now want to supersede it and say, `Do away with that, let the communities decide what they want to do themselves'? 
Including the regular education teacher in an IEP meeting should help to reassure that children with disabilities get appropriate accommodations and support in regular educational classrooms, decreasing the likelihood for a need for discipline. 
Under no circumstances can educational services to a child with a disability cease. If a local educational agency has a policy which prevents it from continuing services when a child is given a long-term suspension or is expelled, the State must assume the obligation to provide educational services to the child with a disability. The disabled child is protected, also. 
The discipline records of the child with the disabilities will be transferred when the child changes schools to the same extent that the records of a non disabled child transfer. That is another thing, which I think was also at the suggestion of the Senator from Washington last year, that you ought to be able to provide that record with the child so the school district that receives a child has warning that there may be problems. Prior discipline records will be provided to officials making decisions about a current violation by a child with a disability. 
We have gone out of our way to accommodate the suggestions of the Senator from Washington which he made last year. I think he helped us craft a very excellent bill. Why does he now want to throw it all away and say, `Yes, notwithstanding that we took care of all these problems, we will let the communities decide how they want to do it'? 
This would create chaos, and, therefore, I have to very strongly oppose the amendment of the Senator from Washington. 
Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Indiana.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of the discussion on this amendment. It is my intention to have it set aside. I would like to point out that this is not just Jim Jeffords versus the cities and towns of America, as Senator Gorton stated. He indicated that the teachers wouldn't like it, but actually, this bill is backed by the National Parent Network on Disabilities, the AFT, and the NEA. It also has the support of the American Association of School Administrators, the National Association of Developmental Disabilities, the Council of Great 
City Schools, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, and 32 other organizations representing millions of people. I urge everyone to vote against the Gorton amendment. 
I yield back the remainder of my time and I ask unanimous consent that the Gorton amendment be set aside temporarily.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Smith amendment. I will not go into all I have said before about why that is necessary. But the House today has completed debate of a version which is identical to the bill before us, and any amendment to it would require us to go to conference. The delay would give time for those who are opposed to the bill to try to scuttle it, as they did last year successfully. 
I want to point out several things with respect to the Senator's amendment. First, it is not necessary. Under the bill as written, there is no award for legal fees without the courts saying there should be; it's purely discretionary. The courts, with their discretion, can take into account the effect of the award on the school districts, or whomever else. So there is that ability to try to reduce the awards. It is in there now. The amendment is also not necessary, because mediation is working. Due to changes in the approaches that have been taken, the cost of litigation and the number of court suits that have been brought as a result of appeals has gone way, way, way down. So we are talking about something that used to be a problem but is not a problem anymore. 
As I pointed out before in addressing Senator Gorton's amendment, I think he is talking about the State of Washington of old, not the State of Washington of the present. In fact, given the dramatic success with voluntary mediation in Washington State and given the success and cost-benefit advantage associated with voluntary mediation of 38 other States, the bill requires all States to offer voluntary mediation. 
So the bill is going to try to help replicate what happened in Washington, which has decreased the number of appeals so substantially--a 96-percent decline in due process hearings held between 1993 and 1996. It is a problem of old. We can forget about it. 
As far as the comments about waving the gun and there being no remedy, that is not accurate. If a child's behavior is not connected to a disability, then he or she is treated like any other child except that there can be no cessation of services. So that certainly takes care of that. If the behavior is related to the disability, the child can usually be removed for not more than the amount of time that the school system would remove a child without disabilities but for not more than 45 days. If at the end of 45 days the school personnel propose to change the child's placement and the parents disagree with the proposal, the child must return to the placement prior to the interim placement except if the school personnel maintain that it is dangerous to do so and make a demonstration to the hearing officer that this is so. And that could go on until there is no risk. 
The best way to help the communities is to vote for this bill. It is important to understand that, if we increase IDEA funding--and that is the effort this body and its Republican Members are putting their full weight behind--all that increased funding will not go to States. Rather, it will flow to the local governments. So, if you want to help local governments take care of problems--and sometimes there are problems--this money going directly to them will assist them more than anything else. The States can't pick any of it off. It goes right to the local government. So I just emphasize that, in my mind, we have taken care of the problems. We are, again, in the position of considering an amendment which could be seriously disruptive. If adopted, it will have no impact on solving real problems, but it would raise the possibility of killing the bill. 
Let me give you an idea about the lawyer's fees and the history of that and let you know exactly what has to occur before you can get an award. There was a case called Smith versus Robinson in 1984. This was a case that came to the U.S. Supreme Court. They 
went through it and found out that, actually, there was no ability to award attorney's fees. So we went into the 1986 session and said there ought to be an award for some under certain circumstances, but we should make sure that it is not in any way automatic and is purely at the discretion of the court. Let me read some of the phrases:  
In any action or proceeding brought by IDEA, or the parent or child with disability against the school, the court may award reasonable attorney's fees. 
`May.' That is discretionary. They could take into consideration everything Senator Smith wants them to. There is no limit on the discretion. Also: 
Attorney's fees may not be awarded and related costs may not be reimbursed in any action or proceeding for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent, and if they had a good deal and didn't accept it, they don't get attorney's fees. 
Attorney's fees may not be awarded related to any meeting of the IEP team unless such meeting is convened as a result of administrative proceeding or judicial action or at the discretion of the State or a mediation is conducted prior to the filing of the complaint. 
I can go through more. I think you get the drift. It is very hard to get attorney's fees. Therefore, that is really not the problem. Plus the mediation process has reduced almost to zero the number of court appeals--only a hundred all last year. I think we are talking about solving a nonproblem and creating a huge problem with respect to the possibility that this bill might be, as happened last year, scuttled at the last minute. 
I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

I think it is very clear that both of these amendments are not necessary--in fact, would create problems rather than solve them, and that what we have is a bill which, if we are able to pass, will save money. That has not been mentioned, but the estimates are it will save up to $4 billion a year in reduced litigation and all of the other problems that are inherent in the process as well as the fact that both amendments are trying to solve problems that are no longer there. In fact, the Gorton amendment will create a monstrous problem and solve none.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to explain where we are. We have one amendment pending, the Gregg amendment, which has been offered and which we all would love to do. Again, I want to explain to my colleagues why we are in a position where it is difficult, if not impossible, for us to accept any amendments, notwithstanding how much we would like to do so. 
The House will be passing in the morning the same bill, identical. We hope to pass here the same bill. The reason for that is one that is hard to explain because I don't like to have this kind of a situation. But as I explained this morning to my colleagues, last year, we came very close to passing the bill which was almost identical to what we have, but we have made some changes to reconcile some of the problems that were raised. At the time, we tried to do that, the word got out and erroneous statements were made about it. This is such a volatile area, where you are dealing with young people with disabilities and educational settings and the concept of mainstreaming and all these things. It is a very emotional subject. The whole thing fell apart. 
What we have done this year with the leadership in the Senate pulling together, with David Hoppe and the groups from all over the country, we finally reached, the other night, the final, final agreement. Everybody is holding hands. Notwithstanding that, there are people today spreading incorrect information around the country that certain things have happened and people are getting concerned. We are trying to make sure we don't have any opportunity for this bill to fall apart. It is so important, so emotional, and so difficult, so we are trying to do that. At times, I will have to speak against things that I agree with. We have the Gregg amendment pending right now. It is a concept I think everybody in the Senate agrees with. In fact, they voted 93 to 0 to do what he wants to do some time ago on the Goals 2000 bill. To do that again would create a problem. I have already announced my support for us to reach the goal of 40 percent to fund the total cost of problems with disabilities in this bill. 
We started off when we passed it back in 1975 with funding at 12 percent. It went down as low as about 5 percent. We are now back up to about 8 percent, around the efforts of Senator Gregg, primarily, last year. I hope we will get that kind of a commitment. I agree with everything Senator Gregg is doing, but I have to oppose it because it would create a problem we don't want to create. With that piece of knowledge, as soon as the Senator from Washington is ready, he can speak; he has an amendment. I wanted to lay out what I will do when he is finished. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington for a very detailed and very well-done discussion of the bill that we are considering, IDEA. However, I have to differ and would like to explain some of the areas where I think there may be confusion, if it is not explained. 
First of all, I reiterate the situation that we have with respect to the requirements of States to provide an education to children with disabilities. This matter was brought up in the late sixties, early seventies in some 26 courts. Two decisions finally were utilized to define what was required. 
First of all, there is no constitutional requirement to provide an education by a State. However, if a State does provide a free education to students, it cannot discriminate, and, therefore, it must provide an appropriate--and that is the keyword the courts used--an appropriate education for a child with disabilities. 
Because this was nationwide in its decision, and since the States all provided a free education, it became necessary to define, in a sense, what was appropriate, and the courts labored to do that. In the consensus decree developed by the parties involved, those kinds of requirements and specificities were defined in that court decree. 
As a result of that, the Congress decided that since this affected all the States, that it be wise if they assisted the States in being able to meet the mandates of the court regarding the requirements of the States to provide an appropriate education. We did that, taking the words from the courts' decisions which defined appropriate education must also, when appropriate, have a mainstreaming component and, thus, we have set out in the early version, 94-142, what was to be done to reach the courts' mandates, not the Congress' mandates but the courts' mandates of constitutional law. 
The Senator from Washington brings up a problem of which we should all be aware, and that is there are limited funds available for our school systems to utilize, and any time that the courts mandate that certain things must be done, that necessarily is going to utilize those additional resources to handle those that are being discriminated against in order to give them an appropriate education. 
That was done. Whether it affects the other young people by having resources not appropriately assigned to the various groups, that is a question which is of interest and of importance for us to take a look at. I personally feel strongly that right now in our country, we have to look at all of the young people and determine that question ourselves. 
I would say that the results of those that are noncollege bound and those that are not under the law with disabilities may have an argument that they are not getting a qualified education, because when we graduate 51 percent of those young people--frankly, all of the young people in that forgotten half group who are graduating from high school functionally illiterate don't have the standards necessary to meet the needs, as the Senator from Washington pointed out, of our society for the next century and may have an argument. That is another case. We are here looking at how to protect children with disabilities in conformance with the courts' mandates regarding States which offer free education. 
Also, he grossly overstated the cost of this in the public school systems. If you take a look at what the costs are, I think the total cost for all of special education is over $30 billion--$38 billion. That is nowhere near what we spend totally on education in this country; certainly nowhere near what perhaps one would think we spend. I do not know what the total is we spend, but it is far in excess of that. 
He also got into the question of uniformity, that there is a double standard. He thinks the States should decide, that they don't need the Federal Government to give them any uniformity. I think that would have been totally disruptive to the system. I think the courts were appropriate to bring the consensus decision they did, and I think the Federal Government appropriately stepped in with this law to say let's have uniformity, let's establish what the standards are that must be met to take care of those children with disabilities. 
A great deal of time was spent on lawyer's fees. I am not going to spend much time on that. I could read the requirements. First of all, there is no requirement for any attorney's fees. There is nothing in the law that says you have to pay. It says the courts may order--they may order--attorney's fees under certain circumstances. If you look at those circumstances, you will see they are all very reasonable ones. It is all may, may, may. There is no requirement that any attorney's fees be paid. I don't want to spend much time on that one. 
I just have to comment on District of Columbia because I love this city, but they do have terrible problems all the way down, it is not just in special education. They have terrible problems up and down. We are trying to correct those. Actions have been taken. But as far as the amount of litigation, there were only 100 cases brought in 1993. We don't have the figures since then. That is hardly any. You have 110,000 schools. There has been a court case in a tenth of 1 percent of the schools. It is not a huge problem in that respect. 
I am personally appreciative of the effort of the Senator from Washington at explaining his position. I think it helps elevate the understanding of the people as to what is in this law. But I disagree with most of the comments made. We do represent--I know from going around--the feelings and opinions of a number of people, and it is appropriate, therefore, for us to discuss, as best we can, these concerns and to alleviate these concerns. I think we have done an excellent job with respect to trying to take care of the problems. 
The final thing I will mention is with respect to discipline and a child that may be dangerous in a school room. I think as has been pointed out, there is a very substantial change to protect the children in a disrupted classroom. A child may be removed now and may be removed continuously, following appropriate procedures, until such time as that child really settles down and is no longer dangerous. 
So it is not the kind of a situation we had before this bill which left, in many cases, the school system pretty helpless when dealing with a disruptive child. I believe we have done an excellent job of taking care of that and, hopefully, my colleagues will read those provisions and agree with me that we have made a great step forward in undoing what has happened in so many of the classrooms in some areas where a child is dangerous and disrupted the school setting. Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to thank the Senator from Missouri for a very articulate explanation of the most difficult area that we faced, and that is how to handle disruptive children in the school. That has been a very, very troubling problem for schools to handle. It has been one which has led to considerable concern about the effectiveness of special education. 
The Senator's help in producing this amendment and in these things, I think, has done more to get this bill quickly in shape where I think it will have close to unanimous passage. I deeply appreciate all the help the Senator has given.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Just to get back to the Gregg amendment very quickly, there is no limit as to what we can appropriate by any authorization level that we could set. We could go for 40 percent tomorrow. There is no requirement. 
Even Senator Gorton voted back in 1994 when the vote was 93 to 0--I have not checked the seven absences, but I do not think the Senator was absent--that as soon as reasonably possible, we ought to fund IDEA. 
There is no necessity for the Gregg amendment. We can do that now. It does set out for my colleagues a very reasoned way to do it, which is in S. 1, a commitment that the Republicans here--that we do it. I think that is important to keep in mind. 
What the Senator from Washington has talked about, well, that would skew things. But look where the money would go. That money would go to the local school districts. That is where it goes. In the bill, right now, as this is written, if we went up to full funding, that money would all flow to local school districts that have any children at all with disabilities. That is where it would go. The States have to keep their levels. So we would help the local school districts so they could use the money and spend it on people you are concerned about that do not have adequate resources. 
This is an excellent way of pushing money to your local school districts. You ought to be yelling and shouting for it. It is exactly what you have always said, that we have to help the local school districts have more flexibility. This gives great flexibility. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today is a special occasion for me and I am proud to be with my distinguished colleagues to consider S. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. 
I was there in the beginning, in 1975, Congress faced with a patchwork of court decisions, first took the historic step in assuring educational opportunities for some of the most vulnerable in our society, children with disabilities. 
In 1975, the Education of All Handicapped Children Act, or Public Law 94-142, was enacted to assist States in meeting the goal of providing a free appropriate public education and offering an equal educational opportunity to all children. 
Public Law 94-142 has done much to meet the educational needs of children with disabilities. 
Over the life of this historic legislation we have seen many advances toward the attainment of these goals--advances in educational technique, advances in technology, advances in opportunity, and advances in our expectations. Children with disabilities are now being educated alongside their peers in unprecedented numbers. Children with disabilities are now achieving beyond our wildest dreams. 
Before Public Law 94-142, society placed little value on the lives of children with disabilities. Millions of children with disabilities were denied access to education, and we invested few resources in anything more than simple caretaking. We have now learned that investment in the education of children with disabilities from birth throughout their school years has rewards and benefits, not only for children with disabilities and their families, but for our whole society. 
We have proven that investment in educational opportunity for all of our kids enriches society. We have proven that promoting educational opportunity for our children with disabilities directly impacts their opportunity to live independent lives as contributing members to society. Most importantly, we have learned to value all of America's children. 
Public Law 94-142 was written in different times to address basic concerns. Concerns that have evolved into expectations. With this evolution in expectations has come an evolution in other concerns that its drafters could never have anticipated. Concerns that must be addressed if we are to continue in the advancement and development of educational programs that have done so much for America's children, our children. 
This year, Mr. President, I have worked hand in hand with majority leader Trent Lott and Chairman Goodling in the development of this agreement. We have also worked hand in hand with Senators Kennedy and Harkin here in the Senate. A bicameral, bipartisan agreement has been reached. 
The process in itself is historic, one in which Democrats, Republicans, the House and Senate, worked together alongside the administration in crafting this consensus bill. 
We held weekly townhall-type meetings that enabled varying stakeholders to provide their input. These stakeholders included parents of the children with disabilities, school administrators, special educators, general educators, and children with disabilities themselves. 
The principal members of the working group were Senator Coats, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and their staffs; Members of the House of Representatives, Mr. Riggs, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Scott, and their staffs; the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education, Judith Heumann, and the Director of Special Education, Tom Hehir. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their efforts. It was an incredible effort. 
We owe much to Senator Frist, who laid the groundwork last year upon which we were able to build this consensus agreement, and for his unwavering support in our efforts this year. We were further aided in our efforts this year by Senator Gregg and Senator Ashcroft and their staffs. 
I would like to thank the following organizations for their participation, guidance and support during our efforts this year. Their support for the final passage of S. 717 is crucial to the overall success of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. I wish to commend them for this support. 
The National Parent Network on Disabilities, the Learning Disabilities Association, the ARC, the National Easter Seal Society, the American Association of School Administrators, the National Education Association, the Autism Society of America, the National Association of the Deaf, the National Down's Syndrome Society, the Epilepsy Foundation of America, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Association of University Affiliated Programs, the American Foundation for the Blind, the American Physical Therapy Association, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Impaired, the National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils, the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, the National Coalition of Deaf-Blindness, the National Mental Health Association, the National Therapeutic Recreation Society, the United Cerebral Palsy Associations, the Council of Great City Schools, Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders [CHADD], the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, the National Association School Psychologist, the Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, the Council for Exceptional Children, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, Federal Advocacy for California Education [FACE], and the American Federation of Teachers. 
I would like to take my colleagues through the steps we took to strengthen and improve IDEA. These steps were not taken lightly. They built upon the procedural protections expressed and the flexibility inherent in current law. I anticipate that when parents and educators have a full and accurate understanding of what we have done, they will embrace this law and these amendments as tools for making the future what it could be, what it should be, for the over 5 million children with disabilities. 
First, we invested in the principle of prevention. No child should have to fail in order to be helped. No child should need a label of disability in order to be helped. We reauthorized the early intervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities. This very successful program, originally authorized in 1986, gives parents direct support and infants and toddlers appropriate services from the moment a disability is known. Over the years, and recently by Rob Reiner, Americans have been told of the consequences of investing and not investing in the earliest years of a child's life. By assisting families with infants and toddlers through IDEA's early intervention program in the last 11 years, we have brought quality of life opportunities to these children and their families that they would not have had. We have mitigated or reduced the effects of disabilities, so that later in life, the children are more successful and less in need of special education and related services. In S. 717 we retain this vital program, and add provisions to encourage States to identify and assist, to the extent they are not doing so now, infants and toddlers who are at risk of developing developmental delays. Such children are those whose special needs are not easily detected in the earliest years, but who clearly do not develop at the same rate or degree as their same age peers in terms of physical, cognitive, emotional, and social development. We also add a provision encouraging States to provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers in natural environments where such children are typically found--the home and with other children of the same age. 
We invested in prevention in other ways as well. S. 717 gives States and local school districts the option of referring to children, eligible for services, as developmentally delayed if they are between the ages of 3 through 9. I believe this simple step will move us a way from investing resources in confirming a specific disability and stamping a specific disability label on a child, and move us toward concentrating our resources on what we can do to help a child succeed in school. 
For the first time, we authorize school-based improvement plans to encourage educators and 
parents at the school building level to work together to set goals to help children, with and without known disabilities succeed. For the first time, we authorize State improvement plans to be developed in collaboration with State and local educators, parents, and others interested in improving educational opportunities and results for children with disabilities. The emphasis in such plans is to ensure better trained and equipped personnel, especially regular education personnel. If teachers are prepared to detect and address a child's problem when it first appears, and make appropriate adjustments in the child's instructional program, the child is less likely to experience failure, and less likely to need special education and related services. 
The focus we bring to prevention in S. 717, means increased flexibility and cost savings for school districts. But more importantly, this focus creates new opportunities for partnerships between parents and educators, and more opportunities for children, all children, to experience a greater degree of success while in school and later in life as well. 
Second, the bill reflects the principle that procedures and paperwork should be driven by common sense, a need to know, and accountability for results that matter. Should parents participate in establishing their child's eligibility for special education and related services? Should parents influence what goes into their child's IEP? Should parents influence the selection of the educational placement of their child? Should a child's regular education teacher influence what goes into a child's IEP? S. 717 dictates that the answer be yes, but so does common sense. 
Should educators and parents share information, including evaluation information, with each other in a timely manner? Should parents know what the rights and protections that IDEA guarantees their child as early as possible, in language that they can understand? S. 717 dictates that the answer be yes, but so does common sense. 
Should educators have an opportunity to offer a free appropriate public education to a child with a disability, before the child's parents place the child in a private school and send the school district the bill? Should educators have a timely, clear, and specific indication that parents intend to request a due process hearing, before they actually do it? S. 717 dictates that the answer be yes, but so does common sense. 
Should educators have the opportunity to explain the benefits of mediation to parents before proceeding to due process? Should educators be responsible for reporting on a child's progress to the child's parents? Along with other children, to the community? To the State? S. 717 dictates that the answer be yes, but so does common sense. 
The third principle that influenced this legislation was that educators and parents need, in fact desperately deserve, the codification of all Federal policy governing how and when a child with a disability could be disciplined by removal from his or her current educational placement. Right now, parts of that policy are in IDEA, parts are in informal policy guidance prepared by the U.S. Department of Education, and still other parts are found in case law. The effects of this have been both unfair and unfortunate. Many educators, unaware of or unsure of their range of 
discretion when a child with a disability breaks a school rule, do little or nothing. Many parents, unaware or unsure of the protections IDEA affords their child, allow their child to go without educational services. We could not let the current situation stand. S. 717 attempts to correct it, through a balanced approach, an approach which recognizes both the need to maintain safe schools and the need to preserve the civil rights of children with disabilities. 
When a child with a disability violates school rules or codes of conduct through possession of weapons, drugs, or demonstration of behavior that is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others in the school, the bill provides clear and simple guidance about educators' areas of discretion, the parents' role, and procedural protections for the child. 
If we adopt this legislation, dangerous children can be removed from their current educational placements. Specific standards must be met to sustain any removal. If a behavior that is subject to school discipline is not a manifestation of a child's disability, the child may be disciplined as children without disabilities. If parents do not agree with the removal of their child from his or her current educational placement, they can request an expedited due process hearing. If educators believe that a removal of a child from his or her educational placement must be extended, they can ask for an extension in a expedited due process hearing. 
If S. 717 is enacted, under no circumstances would educational services to a child with a disability cease. If a child with a disability violates a school rule, and the child's behavior is not a manifestation of the child's disability, the local educational agency, in which the child attends school, must continue educational services to the child. If the policy of the local educational agency, in which the child attends school, prevents it from doing so, the State must assume the responsibility to continue the child's education. This obligation under section 612(a)(1) should not be construed to prevent schools from suspending children with disabilities for up to 10 days, consistent with the provisions in section 615(k)(1)(A)(i). 
The fourth principle which influenced our efforts was that local school districts need options for fiscal relief. Over the life of IDEA they have borne the lion's share of the costs. While retaining a single line of authority, we direct governors to devise ways for noneducational agencies, which could or should bear costs of certain special educational and related services to children with disabilities, to assume responsibility for these costs. We clarify State and local maintenance of effort requirements. States must maintain the State level of dollars spent on special education and related services. Local school districts must maintain local dollars spent on special education and related services. In addition, once IDEA funding reaches $4.1 billion, local school districts may treat as local dollars 20 percent of IDEA dollars that represent an increase from their previous year IDEA allotment. 
The amendments we are considering today, in so many ways, are not only based on common sense, but common practice, on best practice. We do not and would not impose on educators or parents the specific means by which they should respond to these amendments. Their responses will be shaped by local resources and relationships. Such responses, whatever form they actually take in communities across this Nation, will have positive consequences. And that leads me to my fifth, and last point. 
Most children with disabilities are being educated and are succeeding because of IDEA. Less than 1 percent of these children and their families are experiencing disagreements with educators about whether a child has a disability, how a child should be educated, or where a child should be educated, because of the child's disability. However, increasingly, actual disagreements and the likelihood of disagreements are shaping how parents and educators view each other and each other's motivations and actions. This trend is not healthy for the children involved, nor their families, nor their teachers, nor their principals. We must create an atmosphere in which the event of designing a child's education is premised on constructive dialog, common goals, and the child, not premised on the avoidance of a lawsuit. 
In S. 717 we require States to offer voluntary mediation to parents. We attach specific consequences for educators and parents, who fail to share or disclose information that, if provided, may lessen disagreements and legal disputes. We retain provisions added in 1986 to IDEA, that put limits on the conditions under which prevailing parents may receive reimbursement of attorneys' fees. We add other provisions that reflect current policy and legislative history with regard to the use and reimbursement of parents for attorneys' time spent in IEP meetings or mediation. 
I would like to thank the staff members also: Pat Morrissey and Jim Downing, from my staff, Townsend Lange and Bobby Silverstein, Danica Petroshius, Sally Lovejoy, Todd Jones, Bob Bacon, Alex Nock, Theresa Thompson, and most importantly, Dave Hoppe, for without his hard work we could not have achieved our goal.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies that the obligation to make a free appropriate education to children with disabilities does not apply with respect to children age 19 through 21 to the extent that State law does not require special education-related services under part B of IDEA. 
We provided for children with disabilities who, in the educational placement prior to incarceration in an adult correctional facility first, were not actually identified as a child with a disability under section 6023 or did not have an individualized educational program. 
This is a technical amendment to clarify for which children a State does or does not have an obligation to provide special education-related services relative to incarcerated individuals. The same technical amendment is to be incorporated as a technical amendment when it is to be considered by the full House when it considers its companion bill tomorrow. 
This is agreed to by both Houses, as well as by both sides in this. I ask the amendment be considered agreed to.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Hampshire for his amendment, although I will have to oppose it for reasons unrelated to its value. The situation is this, and I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues the situation we face with respect to any amendments. As I earlier expressed and took some time to disclose the tremendous difficulty we have had in getting a consensus--and the Presiding Officer knows how difficult it was because he worked long and hard to obtain a consensus last year, and we thought we had a consensus. At the last moment, it dissolved, it disappeared. Why? Because some people went out and really distorted the great work that had been done--this is such an emotional issue with educators and parents of the disabled--and the whole thing unraveled. 
This year, we started where Senator Frist's efforts stopped and built on that, and not only that, but in the leadership's office with the data, we went the furthest mile possible to make sure everybody understood exactly what was in the bill. It was 
argued and debated. It was from one part of the country to another. Finally, it was agreed that we would all hold hands and work until the last hour of the time possible to make sure that we had every amendment that could be agreed upon done. We finished that effort earlier. However, the situation is this. The House has passed the bill. We will pass that bill on the suspension calendar with the little amendment we had this morning. Once that is done, then it will come over to us and we intend to pass ours. If they are identical, there is no chance of this falling apart. However, if there is an amendment that is of significance, even though I agree with the intent of the Senator from New Hampshire, the thing will fall apart. There is a chance that it won't, but having gone through that experience last year, I don't want to go through it again. 
Let me explain, also, why the Gregg amendment is not necessary. First of all, there are no set authorization levels in the bill, nor have there been in previous legislation. It says such sums as are appropriated and defined. So there is no limit. There is no limit down; there is no limit up. So everything that the Senator from New Hampshire wants to accomplish can be accomplished without his amendment. 
I want to reassure everyone that if the Appropriations Committee decides that it will follow, as it did last year, to add the additional billion dollars, that will be done. On the other hand, if we don't, if we can't agree, we could really have an impasse here. I want to commend the Senator from New Hampshire because I was present in the leadership office when we were discussing these matters at the end of last year when we were trying to reach agreement on the total amount of money that would be spent. He was the one that brought to the attention of Senator Lott the great need--and I backed him up on that--that if we wanted to help the local school districts in this country and really improve the ability to improve education, what we had to do was live up to our commitment to the 40 percent. I was on the conference committee that made that commitment we should provide 40 percent. 
I also want to explain, though a little differently than the Senator from New Hampshire, that, in my mind, this is not a Federal mandate. There were 26 State cases where it was determined there was a constitutional right for an appropriate education. That right included mainstreaming. As a result of that difficulty created throughout the country, the Congress decided that what had to happen was for the Congress to step in and establish those principles that would comply with the constitutional mandate of an appropriate education containing mainstreaming. So that is why, in 1975, we spent many days putting together the legislation which has finally resulted in being here today. 
The mandate is on the States to provide an appropriate education. We devised 94-142 in this law in order to ensure that there were a sense of generally agreed upon principles as well as specific approaches on how to put a bill together that would ensure that the States comply with a constitutional mandate, and everyone would agree upon that. 
So I understand the call for mandate. But I wanted to give that history because I think that is important. 
Also, under the leadership of Senator Gregg some time ago--back about 3 years ago--he came forward with an amendment that we agreed to work on, one that we could pass. I think all of my colleagues should remember this. 
Hopefully, we will remind you today and tomorrow that Senator Gregg and I passed an amendment that said as soon as reasonably possible we will fully fund IDEA. In my mind, that time is here. It is reasonably possible. The money is there. We just have to do it. 
So we don't need another amendment because we voted 93 to 0 in this body to say as soon as reasonably possible we will fully fund it. So we don't need the Gregg amendment. But we need to bring it out of the Appropriations Committee in order to bring that to a reality. As has been pointed out, that is part of the majority view on what should happen this year with respect to the budget. 
We should get ourselves on a path to fully fund this over a reasonable length of time. We can't do it all in 1 year. We know that. But if we go forward and use the guidelines set out in the Gregg amendment we could get there. 
But we don't need this amendment to do that, it has already been done. This amendment raises this issue once again. I praise the Senator from New Hampshire for doing that. It makes it apparent to all of us what needs to be done. It lays the groundwork. 
So at the appropriate time I will ask hopefully that this amendment be withdrawn, or some other way taken to make sure that we do not add the amendment to the bill. 
So I want to again thank the Senator from New Hampshire who has been tireless in his efforts to make sure that we do adequately and appropriately fund 94-142. 
I would also like to point out what the bill does in that regard because I think it is important to know. 
As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, the greatest burden has been placed not where it should be on the States but on the local communities. What we want to do--I agree with him on that--is try to make sure that any additional funds that are placed in the appropriations process must be passed through to the town. That is extremely important. That is in this bill. This bill say to the States that, if we give them more money, they can't just reduce their share. We say they have to maintain their share. Not only that, they have to flow that money through to the local governments where the greatest pressure problems are. 
So this bill I think accomplishes our goals already without this amendment, everything that the Senator from New Hampshire wants to accomplish. It has the flowthrough to make sure, as he wants to see and I want to see, that the local governments have adequate funding, and that the States can't hog it or reduce their own share. 
So I, unfortunately, must oppose the amendment. But, again, I praise the Senator from New Hampshire for bringing it before us. 
Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank wholeheartedly the Senator from Missouri for his comments. I also want to thank him for his introduction of the legislation last year which we found immensely helpful in being able to amend the present law and used to make sure that we did a better job in handling the very difficult situations which the Senator from Missouri referred to. He has been a tireless worker in many areas. This is one of those where he has demonstrated his keen ability to be of assistance in very difficult areas. I thank the Senator very much for his statement.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the legislation that we are discussing today, S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, is timely, commonsense legislation designed to give working families a much-needed option in balancing their busy work and family schedules. I am extremely pleased that the leadership has made passage of this bill a high priority. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act is intended to provide private-sector employers and employees with the same optional workplace flexibility benefits that public-sector employees have enjoyed since 1978. S. 4 provides three alternative work schedule options: One, compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime pay; two, biweekly work schedules; and three, flexible credit hours. I will explain each of these in more detail in a minute. In addition to the workplace scheduling option, S. 4 offers much-needed salary basis reform, and this is a very important problem that we now have as a result of recent court decisions. 
Mr. President, there seem to be many misconceptions about what this legislation does and what it doesn't do. I appear today to clear that up. 
I wanted to go over, first, the four components of S. 4. I believe this will give some of my colleagues a better understanding of this bill. 
The first component of S. 4 is the compensatory time provision. S. 4 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime provisions to allow employers to offer their employees the option of compensatory time off instead of traditional overtime pay. 
In other words, you can trade the time and a half pay for compensatory time off. This provision will allow hourly employees the ability to take time off as a result of having worked overtime. Like State and local government employees, private sector employees would accrue comptime at the same rate as an employer's normal rate of overtime pay, that is 1 1/2 hours of compensatory time off for every hour of overtime worked. 
This legislation is not mandatory. It does not require employers to offer compensatory time off. If employers decide to offer the comptime option to their employees, it is up to the employees to decide whether or not to accept it. Employees who are members of unions will choose compensatory time through the collective bargaining process. Nonunion employees, on the other hand, must `knowingly and voluntarily' enter into an agreement with their employer for comptime before they perform any overtime work. Again, I want to stress that this provision is purely voluntary. 
Mr. President, this legislation goes to great lengths to protect employees. If a nonunion employee does not like the comptime program, he or she may withdraw at any time by providing his or her employer with written notice. The withdrawal of employees who are members of unions will be controlled by the collective bargaining agreement. 
I see no reason why unions should be in opposition to this bill. 
If an employer finds that its comptime program is not working out, it can cancel its compensatory time off policy by providing the employees who have elected to earn comptime with 30 days with written notice. Again, there is nothing compulsory about this law at all. 
Employees are also permitted to cash out--receive the case equivalent of their accrued comptime--at any time. 
Let me repeat that. Employees are permitted to cash out--receive the pay equivalent of their accrued comptime--at any time. So even if an employee selects the comptime option, if that employee decides at a later date that he or she needs the overtime pay instead of time off, the employee has the ability to cash out, to get cash for their overtime work. 
An employee will also receive the cash equivalent of any unused compensatory hours whenever an employer discontinues its compensatory time policy or in situations where an employee withdraws, resigns or is terminated. 
The employer must cash out the employee's compensatory time at either the employee's overtime rate or the employee's final rate of pay, depending on which is greater. 
The legislation allows an employee to accrue up to 240 hours of compensatory time during a 12-month period. If, after the 12-month period, an employee has not used his accrued time, the employer has 31 days to remit the cash equivalent of those hours. If an employee has accrued over 80 hours at any time, an employer may remit the cash equivalent of those excess hours, in lieu of the employee taking time off. 
While opponents of the legislation fear that employers will control when an employee will be able to use accrued compensatory time off, their concern is unfounded. The bill clearly states that an employee must be allowed to use his or her accrued compensatory time off within a reasonable period of time provided that the time off will not unduly disrupt the workplace. This portion of the bill mirrors what is already firmly established, strongly recognized, and upheld in the FLSA and the regulations applying to the public sector. 
Under a compensatory time off program, an employee enjoys the preexisting protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, including prohibitions against violations of section 7 and FLSA's discrimination provision, as well as S. 4's anticoercion provision, which will be an additional provision of FLSA. No employee may be coerced, intimidated or threatened to accept any of the bill's flexible workplace options. Violation of any of these provisions submits an employer to additional liability including liquidated damages and any other viable remedy at law or equity.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Tom Salmon, president of the University of Vermont, who will be retiring later this month. 
Tom and I have worked together for nearly three decades. First as young lawyers in our hometown of Rutland, VT, and then in the general assembly. While he went on to serve as Governor for two terms, I went to Washington to serve in Congress. Although we represented different political parties, we shared a love for Vermont which enabled us to work together and put politics aside. 
More recently, during Tom Salmon's tenure as president of the University of Vermont, we have had the opportunity to work closely again. His commitment to improving the quality of education has been outstanding, and I have watched with admiration as the university has flourished under his guidance. His capacity to make tough decisions while also connecting with students at the university has contributed to his success. No one could ever question Tom Salmon's dedication after hearing about the time he had to excuse himself from an important meeting of the Governor's council of economic advisors because it conflicted with his graduate school seminar. This has been a job that Tom has loved, and one that he has done well. 
As I think back over the years, one thing is very clear, Tom Salmon is a man who cares about the State of Vermont and its citizens. Be it as Governor, teacher, chairman of the board, or adviser, his outstanding ability always shines through making him one of Vermont's most successful leaders.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today along with 16 of my colleagues, I am introducing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. This legislation is the product of 4 months of intensive discussion among members of the committee, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and officials from the U.S. Department of Education. 
The process followed in developing this legislation was unprecedented and demonstrates the high priority all involved place on the importance of the education of children with disabilities, their parents, and their educators. 
Many people and organizations have helped us to develop this legislation. I would like to name just a few. 
First and foremost, I wish to thank the Majority Leader Trent Lott for his unwavering support, and, in particular for the assistance of his Chief of Staff, Dave Hoppe. It is my firm belief that without their commitment to the process that we could not have produced this bill. 
I would also like to thank my colleagues Senators Kennedy, Coats, Harkin, and Gregg, and especially, Chairman Goodling, Mr. Clay and our other colleagues in the House, and Secretary Riley, and Assistant Secretary Heumann. 
I also wish to especially thank Senator Frist, who set the direction and standard that led us in our efforts to reauthorize IDEA in the last Congress. 
I introduce this bill in a much different climate than the one in which Congress first addressed the issue. In 1975, responding to numerous Federal court cases, Congress passed Public Law 94-142 which guaranteed all children with disabilities a `free and appropriate public education,' and promised that the Federal Government would contribute 40 percent of the costs of special education. It is 22 years later and today we are on the threshold of honoring that commitment. 
Our efforts in drafting this legislation are driven by a common belief that education is our No. 1 national priority, and that meeting the needs of our children includes meeting the needs our 5.1 million children with disabilities. In this bill we address several important issues: How to increase the flow of Federal dollars to local school districts; how to expand opportunities for children with disabilities to participate and succeed in the classroom along with their nondisabled peers; and how to ensure the appropriate participation of children with disabilities in State and district-wide assessments of student progress. 
I hope all of my colleagues will support this legislation when it is considered. It's importance has been demonstrated by the collaborative process in which it was developed, and the valuable group of Americans it is intended to serve. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a valued member of the Vermont community, and a true friend, John W. `Jack' Barry, who passed away last Sunday at the age of 70. I had the pleasure of working with Jack for over 20 years as he hosted numerous radio and television shows in Vermont. He was a consummate professional with an amazing knack for the interview. When I was on the other side of Jack's mike, I felt as though we were just chatting--kind of catching up on what I'd been up to in Washington. I wouldn't want to give any of my colleagues the impression that Jack didn't ask the tough questions because he did. He asked many of them but he passed no judgment on the answers. 
Although some would say that Jack began his illustrious career in 1948 as a radio show host at WJOY in Burlington, it actually started at the age of 4 when `Little Jackie Barry' performed recitations for his hometown radio station, WDEV of Waterbury. Over the years Jack worked for numerous radio stations in Vermont and around the Nation, and served for 2 years as Press Secretary for U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy. In the early 1970's he joined the State's public television station to moderate a wide array of programs to include, `Vermont this Week', `Vermont Report' and `Call the Governor'. During the last 3 years, Jack served in public office as a State senator from Chittenden County. 
Among his many honors, Jack was named Vermont's Sportscaster of the Year in 1972, elected to the Vermont Association of Broadcasters' Hall of Fame, selected as the Rutland Herald's Vermonter of the Year in 1991 and 1995, as well as being chosen to receive the Vermont Association of Broadcasting Award in 1981. 
True to his nature, Jack took the time to give back to the community by serving as a board member and trustee of several organizations to include the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, the Vermont Special Olympics, the United Way and the national board of the American Heart Association among many others. 
I extend my most sincere condolences to his wife Bunny, his three daughters; Kathy Yagley, Maureen Ravely, and Bridget Barry Caswell as well as the entire Barry family. Jack had the deepest feelings for Vermont and its people. He was always respectful of others and their differing beliefs. It didn't matter whether they were the frequent callers on his radio show or constituents from Chittenden County, he called them by name, heard them out and genuinely thanked them for expressing their views. 
Jack Barry exemplified what we should all strive to achieve.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are now proceeding on the motion to proceed to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. First of all, I wish to commend Senator DeWine, who is the chairman of the subcommittee which very dexterously handled this bill in committee. I would also like to thank Senator Ashcroft, the original author of the bill, who has done so much to bring, not only the attention of Congress to the problems we are addressing in the Family Friendly Workplace Act, but also helped and assisted in bringing the attention of this body to the problems that are created by the current law. 
I am pleased to be on the floor of the Senate today for the opening debate on the motion to proceed to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of many other colleagues and the effort that went into S. 4 by the committee who was able to bring out a piece of legislation which I am confident will have the support of the Senate. 
I am extremely excited about this legislation because I believe it will positively affect the lives of millions of Americans. Today, there are more working single parents and dual-income families in America than ever before. The Family 
Friendly Workplace Act represents an important step in providing employees in the private sector greater latitude to balance the conflicting demands of work and family. This legislation provides men and women working in the private sector the opportunity to voluntarily choose compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay as well as to voluntarily participate in biweekly and flexible credit hour programs. It does so by giving employees the opportunity to choose to take paid leave time instead of cash compensation for overtime worked and to work out more flexible schedules with their employers if it suits their needs. These same options have been available to State, local and Federal employees for some time and they have been enormously popular with these public sector employees. 
Mr. President, since this bill was first introduced, it has met with opposition. I believe the opposition stems from the political positions of big labor unions rather than the needs of working men and women. I imagine that S. 4's opponents are concerned, in part, because it is the first piece of legislation in nearly six decades that makes any significant modification to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. 
While I understand the concern of S. 4's opponents, I believe that it is misplaced. The Fair Labor Standards Act was, and still is, an important piece of legislation because it provided much needed protection to American workers at the time when their welfare was often disregarded, in the horrible period of the Depression. While the principles behind the Fair Labor Standards Act have not changed, its stringent provisions make it difficult to accommodate the needs of today's work force. 
Since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, there have been considerable changes in our Nation's economy, labor market conditions and labor-management relations. One of the greatest transformations has been in the composition of the U.S. labor force. More women are working than ever before. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, women now account for 46 percent of the labor force. Between 1948 and 1995, women's labor participation rates almost doubled from 33 percent to 59 percent. 
The increase of women in the workplace has had a significant impact on the day-to-day activities of the American family. The stay-at-home mom is now the exception rather than the rule. Indeed, in 1995, only 5.2 percent of all American families mirrored the traditional `Ozzie and Harriet' family structure of a wage-earning father, a nonworking mother, and two children. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 62 percent of two-parent families with children have both parents working outside the home. 
The makeup of the American work force has changed dramatically, yet few provisions of the FSLA have been updated to reflect these changes. The needs of today's work force are different than the needs of the work force of the 1930's. Although employees are demanding more flexible work schedules and compensation packages, the FSLA and its underlying regulations preclude employers from complying with employee needs. 
This need for a change in the existing law was exhibited in a recent poll conducted by Penn & Schoen for the Employment Policy Foundation. The poll indicates that 88 percent of all workers want more flexibility through scheduling and/or the choice of compensatory time. Another national poll revealed that 65 percent of Americans favored changes in the labor law that would allow for more flexible work schedules. It is not surprising that the private sector is demanding change. In a 1985 survey of Federal employees participating with flexible work schedules, 72 percent said that they had more flexibility to spend time with their families, and 74 percent said that having a flexible schedule had improved their morale. 
Over the past several years, the committee has heard compelling testimony from workers about the difficulty of balancing work and family responsibilities. For example, Christine 
Korzendorfer, who works for TRW Systems in Fairfax, VA, testified that she works a lot of overtime hours. Her husband, who is self-employed, also works 7 days a week making caring for their two children a constant struggle. Ms. Korzendorfer said that while the overtime pay is important to her, having extra time off to be with her family is more important. She wants the choice to be able to take comp time off instead of overtime when it best fits her needs and her family's needs. 
In addition, the committee heard from Sallie Larsen, vice president, Human Resources and Communication, TRW Systems Integration Group, about TRW employees' frustration with the rigidity of the current law. Ms. Larsen explained that it was important for her business unit to understand their employees' work patterns because the work patterns factored into how TRW bid for new work. To meet the needs of its employees, TRW saw an opportunity to add flexibility for all of its salaried employees and managers in its work scheduling. As a result, TRW invented a program called the Professional Work Schedule which gives salaried employees the ability to participate in 2-week flexing, partial-day time off and additional time off. However, the restrictions of the Fair Labor Standards Act prevented TRW from offering the program to its hourly employees. Ms. Larsen testified that TRW's hourly employees were amazed to learn that it is a 60-year-old law that is substantially unchanged since it was passed that stands in their way of becoming a full member of the team. 
When the employees ask, `Why am I treated as a second-class citizen?' TRW explains, `It is the law, not the company's unwillingness to offer the professional work schedule to them.' 
As I mentioned earlier, employees in the public sector have had this option since 1985, and it has been very popular. Unlike in the public sector, however, S. 4 would prohibit employees from forcing workers to accept comp-time off instead of being paid overtime as a condition of employment. That is a change from the public law. In fact, under S. 4, an employee's participation in any flexible work arrangement would be totally voluntary. We have worked hard on the language since its introduction to make this crystal clear and to provide strong penalties against any employer who coerces, intimidates, or threatens a worker into accepting such an agreement. 
This is true flexibility for workers and not the heavy hand of the employer. Providing families more flexibility in the workplace to help meet family needs should be a bipartisan goal. In the last year, President Clinton has acknowledged the importance of work force flexibility. For instance, in his recent State of the Union Address the President said, `We should pass flextime so workers can choose to be paid overtime in income, or trade it for time off to be with their families.' 
Because S. 4 will assist American workers to balance the needs of an evolving work environment and quality family time, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, America is currently considering an extremely important and contentious issue: Should we restructure the system by which we obtain our electric energy? And if so, how should we go about doing this? Hardly a day goes by in which one cannot find a news article on this subject. Across our Nation, 44 States have taken on the issue of restructuring, either in legislative debate or through the implementation of pilot programs. And even here in Congress, there are a number of proposals, in both the House and Senate, which address the various factors affecting the electric industry. 
Advocates on all sides are debating whether the Federal Government should direct States to move to a restructured system, both in terms of how they should do it and when. 
There are a number of ideas being offered as to whether utilities should be allowed to recover costs that were incurred under a regulated system, and if so, in what manner and to what degree. Who should bear the burden? The rate payer? The tax payer? The share holder? 
Arguments have been made for and against Federal protection of public power, both in terms of market power and fiscal subsidies. Must companies divest according to function? Does a municipality's tax exempt bond authority give it an advantage over the tax deferrals of the utility, or the less-than-cost loans to the cooperative? 
Mr. President, we continue to hear a great deal about how the effort to restructure the electric power industry may affect the Nation's economy. What is not being discussed, and what I believe is equally important, is how these changes will affect our society as a whole. How will it impact on the Nation's poor? How will it affect our children's health? How will restructuring affect our environment? 
Well, it doesn't have to be an either/or choice. In fact, it can't be. As we move towards a restructured industry, we must consider the issues not only in terms of what they mean to our economy, but also in terms of what they mean to our society. We must secure and enhance the public benefits that until now have been provided by the electric industry's unique structure and regulatory traditions. This can only be achieved by including certain safeguards in any new regulatory structure from the outset, before dramatic changes unravel the gains this industry has made. 
I rise today to introduce the Electric System Public Benefits Protection Act of 1997. This bill acknowledges the responsibility we have to our Nation, to its people and to the environment as we reassess the future of the electric power industry. It directly 
addresses the numerous public benefits we enjoy from our electric power structure, a system that has a unique impact on how we live. And it does this while creating a setting within the electric industry which promotes competition. 
Under the system in effect today, electric utilities have been granted franchises in order to serve the public good. In return for a guaranteed return on their investments, the utilities have, to varying degrees of success, implemented many public purpose programs from which we benefit. These initiatives have addressed the need for alternative fuels, assistance to needy and remotely located consumers, energy efficiency projects, and environmental safeguards. While the industry has made significant progress in the past few decades, recent years have seen a steady decline in investments relating to these initiatives. As the electric industry moves closer to competition and deregulation, utilities are becoming less inclined to support public purpose programs without a guaranteed return. 
My legislation creates a national electric system public benefits fund to enable and encourage State programs for renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, low-income assistance, and universal access. It is supported by a broad-based, competitively neutral, systems benefits charge levied as a wires charge on all interconnected generation for sale on the electricity market. Revenues from the fund will be used to match funds raised by the States for the same public purposes and support the continuation and expansion of the benefits we enjoy today. 
A study of history divulges two important facts about energy efficiency. The first is that the potential for cost-effective savings from accelerated investments in energy efficiency is very large. Yet trends over the last few years raise serious questions about utilities' commitments to energy efficiency programs. Based on the uncertainty surrounding the change within the industry, many utilities have admitted that they have already cut programs and are planning on reducing or eliminating more. While this uncertainty makes long-term predictions in this area difficult, the Energy Information Administration has projected a 13-percent reduction in direct utility expenditures on energy efficiency programs during the period 1995 until 1999. My bill affords States the opportunity to make necessary investments in efficiency technologies. 
The second important fact we have learned is that there exist significant structural and informational market barriers to the deployment of investments in energy efficiency in the absence of targeted programs. My bill will help negotiate these barriers within the industry. 
One of the benefits of energy efficiency is that reduced consumption avoids many of the environmental impacts associated with electric generation. The alternative is potentially devastating. In a recent national survey, respondents were advised that changes in how the utility industry operates could lead to further cutbacks in traditional efficiency programs. Seven out of ten Americans, polled across the Nation, stated that they support mandatory investments in energy efficiency, even if it means higher electric 
rates. They realize that what we invest today may save us billions of dollars during our lifetimes and those of our children. 
The loss of public purpose programs will affect one group in particular. For middle class families, the energy crisis of the 1970's is only a memory; for low-income customers, the energy crisis never ended. A recent study in my State of Vermont showed that residential customers in general spend 3.8 percent of their income on energy, while low-income households spend 15 to 20 percent, and in some cases even more. Unaffordable utility costs are a leading cause of loss of housing for low-income families. Yet another study found that visits by individuals from low-income households to emergency rooms increased after periods of severe weather, when those families had to make the choice to heat or eat. 
It is also clear that low-income families face greater barriers than other groups of customers to implementing the energy conservation measures I spoke of earlier, measures that would reduce their energy costs. Low-income families are more likely to live in rental property, in which they have neither the right to make major modifications themselves nor the ability to persuade their landlords to make energy conservation investments in their housing. While there are low-income homeowners, their incomes are generally insufficient to fund improvements in energy efficiency. My bill will provide a mechanism to help circumvent many of these barriers. 
In considering the impact of restructuring on the Nation's poor, we must also keep in mind that low-income customers are unlikely to be an extremely attractive and highly sought after segment of the electricity market. They are more likely than other customers to have difficulty paying their bills. They are more likely to require payment arrangements and other labor intensive involvement from the utility company. And they are less likely to use large quantities of electricity which might qualify them for volume discounts. We must accept the fact that access to electric power is a necessity in our society. My legislation will help guarantee that everyone has equal access to the benefits of the electric industry. It will target, through the encouragement and development of cooperatives and other market mechanisms, the millions of Americans who are from low-income families, remote rural areas and other groups who lack market power. In short, Mr. President, it ensures that essential services remain affordable and the benefits of competition are available to all utility customers. 
We have learned the hard way that the Nation's economic well-being can be put at risk by rapid spikes in world energy prices. Future dislocations could result from fossil fuel supply interruptions or problems associated with nuclear powerplants. History teaches us that a policy of prudent energy diversification is a form of national economic security that is well worth purchasing. 
Additionally, renewable energy sources are good for our environment. Every megawatt of electricity generated by a wind turbine displaces another from a fossil fuel source and lessens the environmental impact of the industry. 
Yet, the future of renewable energy is in doubt. I would like to direct your attention to this chart. Scientists tell us that, despite the obvious advantages I have cited, the amount of electricity from renewable sources is projected to remain stable at about 2 percent well into the future. My legislation establishes a renewable portfolio standard for all electric generation companies. It begins with 2.5 percent in the year 2000 and slowly grows to 20 percent in the year 2020. These are not arbitrary numbers. They are based on information provided by the electric industry and account for realistic constraints on how fast these sources can develop. 
This bill enables States to play an active role in the development and fielding of alternative fuels technology. It recognizes the importance of fuel diversity, and it guarantees that renewable energy sources will play a significant role in this diversification and in providing consumer choice in the restructured industry. 
Mr. President, I am particularly concerned about what may be the single greatest market failure of the electric power industry: the protection of our environment. The electric industry accounts for about 3 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product, yet it accounts for up to two-thirds of some of the country's deadliest pollutants. We have worked hard to reduce this problem, and there is no doubt that some success has been achieved. But it is not enough. 
Electric powerplants emit 65 percent of the Nation's annual total of sulfur dioxide, an invisible gas that adversely affects our health and environment. Asthmatics are particularly vulnerable to this pollutant. The leading cause of chronic illness in children, cases of this disease are climbing at a sharp rate and are exacerbated by our deteriorating environment. 
Sulfur dioxide also is the principal cause of acid rain. This chart illustrates the fact that while the annual emissions of sulfur dioxide are expected to come down slightly in future years, this decline is not sufficient. My bill would cause a dramatic change by the year 2005, decreasing the amount of this deadly gas from electric powerplants by roughly 60 percent. 
This next chart reveals the problem this Nation will face in the future as increasing amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the air from the electric industry. Powerplants currently generate close to 40 percent of the nationwide emissions of this pollutant, a gas chiefly responsible for global warming and the creation of a greenhouse effect. The resulting climate change has the potential to inflict devastating damage on our environment for many years, well into the future. Unlike other pollutants, carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for decades. If we are to protect our children's future, we must act now. As you can see, my bill, designed to bring the industry back to the 1990 standard, requires a significant 13 percent reduction by the year 2005 and will double that by the year 2015. 
This legislation would bring about a major reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions. The electric power industry is the single largest source of this pollutant. Nitrogen oxide emissions are particularly offensive to me as a Vermonter because of the extreme ozone problem they present. There are days now when, standing atop Mount Mansfield, I can not make out the water tower on Mount Elmore, not even 20 miles away. This is disgraceful, and it is a problem faced in many areas across this Nation. 
Nitrogen oxides are now blamed for significant health problems as well. Scientists recently discovered that this pollutant may be responsible for increasing levels of cancer cases and breathing disorders. As depicted on this chart, my legislation will mandate a 70 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants by the year 2005. 
Cognizance of these environmental problems cuts across party lines. A recent poll in the State of Texas shows that 7 out of 10 residents who define themselves as very conservative favor significantly stronger environmental standards. In fact, in the nationwide survey I spoke of earlier, 80 percent of the respondents agreed that we need to act on the problem. 
Mr. President, we need to fix the problems attributable to electric power production. But as we move to a restructured industry, we need to fix it in a fair, competitively neutral manner. This bill does just that. Setting a single, nationwide emissions standard for all generators which use combustion devices to produce electricity, it says stop to some of the Nation's dirtiest powerplants. It means we as Americans will no longer tolerate the idea of giving a free ride to those that can't meet the standard. It levels the playing field so that all generators can compete in the market on an equal footing and with the same environmental responsibilities as their competitors. 
Finally, we need to give people the information they need to make intelligent choices regarding their electricity. My bill directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a system whereby electric service providers must disclose to the consumer adequate information on generation source, emissions and price. Only when the consumer has the ability to compare can we say we have a truly competitive market. 
In closing, I want to emphasize that any restructuring of the Nation's electric power industry must address the economic and the social aspects of the issue. It is not an either/or choice. We must do both.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Middlebury College and its student production of `The Last Supper Restoration.' This group of fine arts students will be one of eight participating in this year's American College Theater Festival at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts from April 14 to April 22, 1997. The production was chosen from among 900 presented on campuses throughout the United States in 1996. 
The student playwright, Michael Kanin, was presented with the National Student Playwriting Award and has been recognized for his tremendous efforts by the Association for Theatre in Higher Education. The students' work is in the finest tradition of Vermont and truly represent the creative spirit of our Green Mountain State. 
This accomplishment is testimony to the outstanding education and diverse opportunities provided by a true center of excellence, Middlebury College. Once again, I would like to extend my best wishes and congratulations to the Middlebury College thespians.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Margaret MacArthur. Margaret has been selected to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts on May 1, 1997. She will be appearing as the sole representative of Vermont in an annual celebration which will host artists from across the Nation. 
Margaret represents the very best of Vermont. Her talent and hard work have been recognized time and time again. In 1985, she was selected by the New England Art Biennial as a New England living art treasure. 
Margaret's repertoire consists almost exclusively of Vermont and other New England folk songs. She embodies the spirit of our Green Mountain State and has successfully shared its heritage, through music, with people throughout the country. Once again, I would like to extend my best wishes and congratulations to Margaret MacArthur.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today before the Senate to recommend that we approve the nomination of Ms. Alexis M. Herman to serve as Secretary of Labor. 
Ms. Herman's career has been filled with many firsts. In 1977, Ms. Herman was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to be the first African-American woman to lead the Women's Bureau. Twenty years later, Ms. Herman is poised to become the first African-American woman to serve as Secretary of Labor. 
To be appointed and confirmed as the Secretary of Labor is one of the greatest honors that our Nation can bestow upon an individual. It is an honor, however, that comes with a heavy burden of responsibility. Individuals who hold this office become stewards of the public trust and bear a great responsibility to the working men and women of America. It is my hope and my sincere expectation that Alexis Herman will preserve this trust and serve our country ably and effectively as Secretary of Labor. 
Ms. Herman will take the helm of the Department of Labor at a critical juncture in its history. The passage of welfare reform has made the strengthening of our job-training programs more important than ever. People must be able to obtain skills that will lead to secure jobs. Workers are entitled to fair pay in a safe environment. And while a great deal of attention is being focused on the future of the Social Security system, it is incumbent upon us to ensure the stability and expand the reach of the private pension system as well. I have devoted my career to these issues and I look forward to working with Ms. Herman to strengthen the Department of Labor's education and training programs and improve the quality of life of working men and women. 
It is because of my belief in and support for the mission of the Department that I have done my best to thoroughly review the background of this nominee. The pace may have seemed slow to some people but I was convinced then, as I am now, that it is better to take the time to do this job properly. 
Our efforts were complicated by ongoing revelations 
of White House fundraising activities and by the announcement that the Office of Public Liaison, which the nominee was heading, was, and continues to be, the subject of an investigation by the Office of Special Counsel. But our efforts are now complete and the committee recommends that the Senate confirm Ms. Herman as Secretary of Labor. 
Ms. Herman brings a unique set of skills and experience to the position of Secretary of Labor. In the mid-1970's she administered a pioneering program in Atlanta that helped minority women obtain white collar jobs. From 1977 until 1981, she served as the Director of the Women's Bureau under President Jimmy Carter. In this capacity she led the Department of Labor's efforts to identify and address the needs of working women across the country. 
Over the years, Ms. Herman has earned a reputation for her ability to build coalitions and work effectively with groups holding disparate and divergent political views. It is my hope that these skills will be used to seriously address our Nation's workplace and work force development needs as we prepare for the 21st century. 
We have an ambitious legislative agenda for this year--already the committee has reported S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, and S. 295, the Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1997. These bills represent critical responses to the vast changes in the American workplace--changes that are unrecognized in a body of labor law unchanged since the Great Depression. Employers and employees should be working with, not against, each other whether it's figuring out a problem on the shop floor or in an employee's schedule. 
Over the next few months we will develop legislation to better integrate education and job training programs and we will begin to explore ways to improve the security and soundness of the private pension system. These legislative initiatives will have profound implications for the economic competitiveness of our Nation and for the quality of life of American workers. We will only succeed in these efforts if we have leadership from the Secretary and a firm commitment to avoid partisan politics in the interest of addressing critical national needs. 
I believe that Ms. Herman will be a full partner in these endeavors and that she will join us in our effort to improve the quality of life of working men and women. I look forward to working with her in her new capacity as Secretary of Labor. 
I reserve the remainder of my time. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I first of all want to thank the majority leader and majority whip for the expeditious way they have handled the resolution with respect to the Executive order. I know they dedicated the time necessary to make sure this got done as efficiently and as effectively as possible so we could move this nomination along. 
I also want to thank the members of my committee, especially the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] for the way they controlled themselves and were able to, after a rather extensive amount of time required to fully review the nominee's record, bring this nomination before the body today. And of course, as Senator Kennedy mentioned, I cannot tell anyone how hard the staff worked on this particular nomination, probably harder than any other nomination at least in my memory, especially Ted Verheggen and Scott Giles of the majority as well as the minority staff, especially Mark Childress, whom Senator Kennedy mentioned. This took undue hours of committee staff time as well as members to review all of the material that was available. 
I am pleased now that we have brought this to a conclusion. I would point out that the Labor Committee was unanimous in its vote with respect to nominee, and I urge all Members to support a woman who I know will bring real credit to the office of the Secretary of Labor. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time and ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the children of America need our help. Nearly 10 million children have no health insurance. Many of these children live in families with working parents who simply do not make enough money to afford health insurance. 
In order to help address this national problem, I am pleased to cosponsor, with many of my good friends and colleagues, the Children's Health Insurance Provides Security [CHIPS] Act. The CHIPS Act will provide Federal financial incentives to encourage States to provide uniform Medicaid coverage up to 150 percent of poverty for children of all ages. 
The Medicaid Program provides health care for poor children and pregnant women. My home State of Vermont, through its Dr. Dynasaur program, uses Medicaid and is now ranked second best in the Nation in providing health insurance coverage for children under 18 years of age. 
We felt it was important to improve our existing Medicaid system, a system which is already in place and currently provides health coverage to 16 million low-income children. Three million additional children are eligible to receive Medicaid benefits, but they are just not enrolled. We should fix that problem. We also feel that it is important to provide incentives to expand Medicaid coverage nationally to the children of families who are at 150 percent of the Federal poverty level--the working poor. This legislation builds upon the good work done in Vermont, and many other States, in ensuring that our children have access to health care. 
Our bill encourages States to expand current Medicaid eligibility for children and pregnant 
women to 150 percent of the Federal poverty level by increasing the amount of money that the Federal Government contributes to the Medicaid Program. States that elect to participate in the program will need to guarantee that all children are covered to at least 100 percent of the Federal poverty level and that all children are provided with 12 months of continuous medical coverage. 
The bill also provides grant money for outreach programs. States may design their own outreach programs based on their special needs and specific populations. We will help by simplifying the application process for Medicaid and other Federal programs for which these children qualify. One third of all uninsured children are eligible but not enrolled in Medicaid. Our bill, by emphasizing outreach and administrative simplification, will help get many of these children enrolled in the Medicaid Program. 
We must commit our efforts to giving children the best possible start in life. As a recent report entitled `the Social Well-Being of Vermonters' indicates, the foundations we lay for our young children will affect their later success in all areas of life. A healthy start begins with a healthy pregnancy and early, comprehensive prenatal care. Our legislation will give many children the health insurance coverage they need and, by doing so, help ensure a solid foundation for our country's future.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, current law requires retired military personnel individuals in receipt of disability compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to offset any retired military pay for which they become eligible. Today Senator Daschle and I are introducing legislation that would gradually eliminate this offset based on the inverse of the retiree's disability rating. This offset requirement unfairly discriminates against career soldiers who become disabled by requiring them to fund their own disability benefits. 
As an example, a veteran with 60-percent service-connected disability would have to offset his retirement pay by the amount equal to 60 percent of his total VA disability. This compromise legislation would establish the right of a disabled military retiree to receive at least a portion of his earned military retirement while avoiding an insurmountable cost that, under budget rules, would require an offset in other funding areas of the Department of Defense. 
Current law does not take into account the obvious distinction between military retirement and disability compensation entitlements. Military retirement is paid to recognize a soldier who has dedicated 20 or more of his or her years to our country's defense. Disability benefits are intended to compensate a veteran for injury for injury incurred in the lined of duty. Because these two types of compensation serve two different purposes, receipt of one should not prevent a veteran from receiving the other. 
Congress has sought to deal with this issue over the years in a number ways--most of these attempts have brought with them unreasonable cost estimates. This legislation would ease the offset burden on retired disabled service members and still avoid significant expansion in the deficit. Also, because career military retirees are the only group of Federal retirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to receive VA disability, the need to change current law is especially pressing. Inversely, disabled veterans who elect to leave military service and go into either other Federal employment or the private sector will, upon retirement, continue to receive their full disability payments, along with any earned retirement benefits. 
This bill is supported as a step in the right direction by the Nation's veterans service organizations, including the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
Congress should move quickly to reverse this law prohibiting career military personnel who are wounded or injured during their service from receiving earned retirement benefits. I hope the Senate will act to end this unfairness once and for all by passing legislation to ease the offset. In allowing disabled veterans to receive military retired pay and veterans disability compensation concurrently, with an offset that is inversely related to the degree of disability, we will restore some fairness to Federal retirement policy cost-effectively. Our veterans have earned that and much more.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a day many of us have been waiting for for a long time. After having been thoroughly reviewed by the relevant Senate committees, both in the last Congress and this one, the Chemical Weapons Convention has finally come to the Senate floor for debate and a vote. 
This is a complex and controversial treaty and I thank Senator Helms, Senator Biden, and others for their hard work on the resolution of ratification. The 28 conditions and provisions on which they have agreed go a long way toward protecting American interests and making this an even better treaty. While I have reservations about the remaining five provisions, I am pleased that the Senate will have the opportunity to openly discuss and debate these before moving to a final vote. I believe that when the facts come to light, those who are undecided will vote to ratify the treaty. 
I think I can safely say that no one in this body supports the production or use of chemical weapons, even as a deterrent. That is not what this debate is about. What it is about is what we get for what we give up. In other words, is the extra protection from chemical weapons that this treaty affords us worth the financial cost and the regulatory burden required to implement the treaty? 
Well, let's take a look. First, what do we get? 
Above all, we get enhanced national security. The treaty requires all signatories to do away with chemical weapons and to refrain from any future production. We have already committed to destroy our own chemical weapons stocks, so why shouldn't we grasp an opportunity to require others to do so as well? I think this is a compelling argument. So do a few other people who know something about national security matters: General Powell, General Schwarzkopf, and every living former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Believe me, if this treaty weakened the United States in some way these distinguished Americans would not support it. 
With a reduction in the number of chemical weapons we also get increased protection for U.S. troops. We have a responsibility to our brave men and women in uniform to do all we can to protect them as they put their lives on the line for our freedoms. We spare no expense to provide them with the best chemical weapons defenses possible. By the same token, we should do all we can to reduce the 
actual threat of a chemical weapons attack on them. Recognizing this, a number of the country's most prominent veterans' groups and military associations have spoken out in favor of the CWC, including the VFW and the Reserve Officer Association. They recognize the extra protection this treaty provides our troops in the field. 
The CWC also improves our ability to detect chemical weapons production by others. This treaty boasts the most intrusive verification regime of any arms control agreement ever. Will it enable us to sniff out every violation, every criminal effort to produce these horrible weapons? Of course not. But it will give us a powerful new tool to check up on those who seek to employ chemical weapons, something that is important to the intelligence community. Opponents point out that U.S. intelligence agencies cannot absolutely guarantee they will be able to detect treaty cheaters. This is true. But it is also true that the treaty will significantly improve our ability to uncover violations. Let's not make the perfect an enemy of the good. 
Finally, the CWC also stiffens international resolve to deal with the chemical weapons threat. Every signatory will be required to enact legislation cracking down on terrorists and criminals who use or threaten to use poison gas, as well as the unsavory businessmen who traffic in these dangerous chemicals. Last week the Senate passed a bill which would tighten U.S. laws in this area. Isn't it in our interest, in this ever-shrinking world, to make sure that others also toughen their laws against chemical weapons production? Moreover, a broadly accepted international regime outlawing this class of weapons altogether will put us on a much stronger footing to respond to serious violations, including by force if necessary. 
So with the CWC we get enhanced national security, better protection for U.S. troops, improved ability to detect violations, and stiffened international resolve in addressing this global problem. 
That's a pretty valuable package. What do we give up to get it? Well, we must pay our share of the costs for administering the treaty and carrying out required inspections. We must also underwrite costs associated with preparing U.S. military facilities for inspection. I understand that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementation of the CWC would cost the U.S. taxpayer about $33 million a year. That's about one-twentieth of the amount that we spend every year on chemical and biological weapons defenses. I think that's a reasonable investment to reduce the core threat against which these defenses are needed. 
The treaty does impose additional reporting and inspection requirements on American businesses in the chemical field. This is regrettable but necessary if we wish to have a serious verification regime. It's worth noting, though, that the U.S. chemical industry was closely involved in the negotiation of the treaty and strongly supports it. I am sympathetic to the concerns expressed by smaller businesses affected by the treaty but believe that some treaty opponents have vastly exaggerated the additional regulatory burden involved. As I understand it, the vast majority of these businesses will need do no more than submit a short, basic informational form annually. And only a handful are likely to be inspected in any given year. This is a small price to pay for the many benefits of the treaty. 
Finally, I would like to address the argument that the United States should withhold ratification until Russia and all the so-called rogue states sign and ratify the treaty. The issue is not whether we should press these countries to join the treaty--of course, we should--but how to most effectively achieve this goal. Does anyone really think that withholding U.S. ratification will convince these countries to sign up? Standing on the sidelines with arms folded will only give encouragement to those who want to ignore this treaty and continue making chemical weapons. The United States is a world leader and should act like one. We should not allow thugs like Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein to dictate our approach to national security matters. 
Mr. President, this treaty is good for America and good for the world. It's not perfect. What international treaty is? But it serves our interests and improves our security. For these reasons, I will vote to ratify and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Earth Day to introduce legislation to reauthorize the African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988, a historic conservation measure that continues to successfully preserve the African elephant in its natural environment. This legislation will extend the act through September of the year 2002. 
The African Elephant Conservation Act has resulted in the stabilization of elephant populations on the African Continent. By the late 1980's, the population of African elephants had dramatically declined from approximately 1.3 million animals in 1979 to less than 700,000 in 1987. The primary reason for this decline was the poaching and illegal slaughter of elephants for their tusks, which fueled the international trade in ivory. 
To address this problem, the U.S. Congress enacted the African Elephant Conservation Act to provide assistance to African nations in their efforts to stop poaching and to develop and implement effective conservation programs. To accomplish this goal, the legislation created the African elephant conservation fund. Since 1988, Congress has appropriated over $6 million to fund 48 conservation projects in 17 range states throughout Africa, with additional contributions of $7 million through private matching moneys. 
The African elephant conservation fund has resulted in the development and implementation of various elephant conservation plans. Today, elephant populations have stabilized and are on the increase in southern Africa, the international ivory trade has been dramatically reduced, and wildlife rangers are better equipped to stop illegal poaching activities. The conservation fund originally focused on anti-poaching efforts. Over the last several years, the projects have diversified to include elephant population research, efforts to mitigate elephant and human conflicts, the cataloging of ivory stockpiles, and the identification of new techniques for effective elephant management. It is important, however, to keep in mind that, while the African elephant conservation fund has resulted in several successful conservation projects, much work remains to be done to ensure that the African elephant continues to survive in its natural environment. 
We must work to ensure that the African elephant does not once again decline and disappear from its historic range. I am confident that additional conservation projects funded through the legislation will help to preserve this flagship species for many future generations. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization Act of 1997.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to raise my concerns also as expressed by the Senator from Georgia. I rise to express my continuing and growing concerns regarding the efforts of President Clinton and his administration to bypass Congress and impose the ultimate in top-down union organizing--union organizing by the President of the United States--on Federal construction projects. I am speaking, of course, of the widely circulated draft of a proposed Executive order that would result in most, if not all, federally funded construction being performed under a union project labor agreement. 
A project labor agreement would deter a major portion of the contractor universe--open shop or nonunion contractors--from bidding on construction work paid for by American taxpayers. Because the project labor agreement adopted pursuant to the proposed Executive order would require a contractor to enter into an agreement with a labor union as a condition of bidding on the Federal project, most open shop contractors, unwilling to impose a union on themselves and their employees, simply would not submit a bid. Thus, the union-only project labor agreement not only eliminates open competition for Federal contracts, an anticompetitive effect that would result in increased costs of Federal construction to the taxpayers, but also discourages open shop contractors from bidding on work that they are paying for with their own tax dollars. 
In addition to its anticompetitive impact, the proposed Executive order also would deprive nonunion workers of jobs in Federal construction, again jobs paid for out of those workers' wallets. Union agreements invariably require job seekers to obtain work through a union hiring hall. Hiring hall referral 
traditions favor longstanding union members. Others, such as the nonunion workers of the open shop contractor, would find themselves at the end of the referral line. This Executive order would penalize the overwhelming majority--majority--of construction workers in this country, who have not chosen to be union members. 
The proposed Executive order clearly is an effort by the administration to set national labor policy, a job that is delegated to the Congress by the Constitution--by the Constitution--of the United States and not to the President. The wisdom of this delegation of policymaking to the legislative process by the drafters of the Constitution is proven in the matter before us. The proposed Executive order raises many more questions than it answers, questions, I note, that, if subjected to the debate and factfinding of the legislative process, could be resolved. 
For example, what is the effect of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the ERISA, on a project labor agreement's provision that would require an open shop contractor to participate in a union pension plan? The contractor likely covers its employees in another plan, and the contractor's employees probably would receive no benefits from the union pension plan because they would not be vested before the completion of the federally funded project. 
Another example of a question best addressed by congressional review is whether the anticompetitive and overly restrictive provisions of the proposed order violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996, just recently passed. 
The proposed Executive order, however, raises even more fundamental questions regarding the continued vitality of our national labor policy that provides for Federal Government neutrality in matters of labor-management relations, a longstanding policy. This neutrality has been at the core of the national policy since the passage of the Wagner Act back in 1935. The administration, without the benefit of studied review and debate inherent in the legislative process, would reverse this policy and ignore the over 60 years--over 60 years--of its fine tuning by Congress and the courts. The administration's approach, that of lawmaking by Executive fiat, would answer these, and other questions posed by the Executive order, by litigation, not legislation. 
I expressed my strong support for S. 606, a bill introduced by Senator Hutchinson, that would prevent the exclusion of nonunion contractors from federally funded construction. I note that I am a cosponsor of this bill and look forward to its deliberation in the manner established by the Constitution. 
I urge my colleagues to take note of what is going on. 
This is a gross example of the abuse of the authority of the President through the Executive order. He tried this before. The courts knocked it down with respect to striker replacement. Here they come again with another proposal. 
This is extremely important for contractors, for the Nation, and for the taxpayer. I yield the floor.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to address a very real threat to the economic well being of our Nation. I speak, of course, of the anticipated issuance by President Clinton, of an Executive order that would likely lead to the exclusion of nonunion contractors from Federal construction. I also wish to express my strong support for S. 606, introduced today by Senator Hutchinson, which I have cosponsored. 
The strength and prosperity of this great Nation are in large part a result of the industrial peace between labor and management, that has been the norm since the passage, in 1935, of the Wagner Act. That act, and its progeny, form the keystone of our national labor relations policy. The bedrock belief supporting this policy has been to recognize that the parties--workers, employers, and unions--are in the best position to resolve their differences and to set and to achieve their goals. To this end, Congress has maintained a basic hands-off policy, preferring to set only the broadest boundaries, beyond which the conduct of the parties must not stray. I have to say that our congressional predecessors legislated wisely, for this policy of Federal Government neutrality has allowed the United States to become the envy of the industrialized world. 
This is not to say that there have not been bumps in the road to labor-management harmony. Congress has amended the Federal labor laws, and also has considered, and rejected, amendments to the Federal labor laws. Attempts by Congress to smooth the bumps, however, have been subjected to one overriding process--any changes to the laws that nurture the balance between the parties in the industrial arena will have been forged in the heat of legislative debate and advocacy. 
Today, sadly, the Clinton administration considers an action that would displace Federal neutrality, thereby renouncing over 60 years of national labor policy, and ignoring 60 years of fine tuning of that policy by Congress and the courts. Simply put, the Executive order being considered by the Clinton administration would result in most, if not all, Federal construction being performed by union shop contractors. This would give a whole new meaning to the term top down organizing. It would represent union organizing from the very top--the Presidency of the United States. 
Further, this Clinton initiative would occur without benefit of the legislative process, the process which in my opinion is mandated by the Constitution of the United States. And I find it even more disheartening that this end run by the administration, of the policy setting role of the Congress, seems less designed to serve the public interest than to advance political interests. 
Now, I understand that the administration will probably argue that the proposed order does not mandate the adoption of a project labor agreement, and therefore does not inescapably lead to union-only contractors on Federal construction projects. The administration would go on to argue that since the order requires the Federal agencies to make a finding that use of a project labor agreement would advance the Government's procurement interest, only where that finding is made would union agreements be required. This argument, however, is suspect. The introductory paragraphs of the draft order clearly indicate the President's preferences as to use of a project labor agreement. Since the boss thinks it is such a good idea, it is not likely that persons that the President selected to head the executive branch agencies would think otherwise. 
There is one other factor that is very important, and must be noted. Employment in the construction industry, particularly where union agreements are in place, is done through hiring hall referrals. If a nonunion contractor is forced, because of a project labor agreement, to become a party to a union agreement, it is not hard to picture what would happen to that contractor's employees. They would be at the back of the line when it comes to hiring hall referrals. This is despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of construction workers have not chosen to belong to a union.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join 31 of my fellow Senators in introducing a reauthorization of our Nation's transportation legislation, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. This bill commits our country to sound transportation planning and development and reflects the vital role transportation plays in our expanding economy. 
In 1991, I was proud to be a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and an original author of ISTEA. This innovative law has resulted in the development of efficient and effective transportation throughout our country. ISTEA shifted decision making from Washington to local communities, enhanced air quality health standards, increased mobility and allowed our economy to grow in an intelligent manner. 
Today, I am equally honored to be involved in the introduction of ISTEA WORKS, the continuation of this successful law. This bill retains the basic structure of ISTEA, preserving the role of States and local communities in deciding transportation policies, continuing the emphasis on intermodalism and maintaining support for strong environmental provisions. The bill protects the important enhancements programs, expands the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality program and improves safety. 
This legislation also addresses an issue important to Vermont and the Nation. As we have heard recently, Amtrak continues to struggle with its finances. Although I know Amtrak will survive, action must be taken to improve the system now. ISTEA WORKS grants States the flexibility to use Federal transportation dollars for operating and maintaining passenger service. This flexibility is important to Vermont, where we are running two of the most successful passenger trains in the Nation. The new authority will also enable our State to expand passenger rail and upgrade rail lines to benefit freight rail traffic. 
Mr. President, this is a historic occasion. With the introduction of this legislation, we begin to raise the awareness of the success of ISTEA and the urgent need to reauthorize this important legislation with few major changes.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Iva Mae Decker, a Vermonter and very special woman who is celebrating her 105th birthday today. 
Iva Mae Decker was born in Montpelier, VT, on April 14, 1892. Ask Iva Mae what the secret to her longevity is and she will answer: `Just keep on moving.' 
Iva Mae lives at home with her daughter, Beverly, and appreciates the support she receives from her friends in the community. She is a shining example that independence need not be lost due to age. Beverly says of her mother, `She remembers the past, lives in the present, and looks forward to the future.' 
Iva has a genuine concern and warmth for others, as the children of the Proctor Elementary School will attest. In 1992, during the annual Count to 100 Day, Iva visited the first graders in Proctor, VT. Five years later, Iva continues to encourage these children to read and write through correspondence and poetry. 
To celebrate her 103d birthday, Iva took a hot air balloon ride. A surprise 104th birthday present provided by many friends, family and local businesses fulfilled Iva's life-long dream of riding the cable cars in San Francisco. She had a tremendous trip. 
Last week, Iva had planned to celebrate her 105th birthday by visiting Washington, DC to tour the city and share her thoughts on Government with her congressional Representatives. However, the flu forced her to postpone her plans for the moment. A birthday celebration will be held instead in her home today. Among the many officials attending will be Rutland's mayor who will present a Rutland city proclamation in her honor. 
I would like to join Iva Mae's many family and friends in wishing her a very happy birthday. Her longevity and zest for life is an inspiration to us all.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Family Forest Land Preservation Tax Act and the Northern Forest Stewardship Act and commend both Senator Leahy and Senator Gregg for their leadership in these bills. Both bills include recommendations from the Northern Forest Lands Council that address the general consensus of the residents in the Northern Forest region. 
Since the Northern Forest Lands Council's creation in 1990, hundreds of citizens have been seeking ways for Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont to maintain the traditional patterns of land ownership and use of the Northern Forest. For over 4 years the council conducted indepth research, assessed data, consulted with experts, held public meetings, and listened to thousands of people who live and work in the region. The recommendations that are incorporated in both the Stewardship Act and the Preservation Tax Act, represent the thoughtful work of many individuals who live and work in the Northern Forest region and hundreds of hours of forums and public meetings. 
Mr. President, I am grateful and appreciate the dedication and vision of the members of the Northern Forest Lands Council and the thousands of people who participated in the process. I am grateful, because the 26-million-acre forest that stretches from eastern Maine through New Hampshire and Vermont and across New York provides important and valuable resources. This forest region is home to 1 million residents. The people that work and live in this region have a bond to the land. Hunting, fishing, trapping, walking, and hiking in the woods have been a way of life for generations. 
Nearly 85 percent of the Northern Forest is privately owned. For years, these lands have provided a diversity of environmental and economic benefits. Families and individuals have taken care of their forests for generations providing economic viability to communities and overall economic health to the region as well as maintaining opportunities for recreation, natural beauty, and wildlife. The traditional values within the forest regions are also cherished by those who live outside the region. Seventy million people live within a day's drive of the Northern Forest. They too, realize the importance of the Northern Forest for its source of clean water, clean air, and vast diversity. 
Mr. President, the Preservation Tax Act and the Stewardship Act are needed to protect and maintain the traditional and valuable uses of the Northern Forest. Complex social and economic forces, some originating outside the region, have led to competing and conflicting uses of the Northern Forest. These two bills will help keep the Northern Forest productive and protected. 
The Family Forest Land Preservation Tax Act will help encourage private forest land owners to conserve their productive forests. Since well managed productive forests are such an essential element to the traditional values of the Northern Forest region, the Preservation Tax Act is vital to maintaining sound forest management. Although this bill was based on recommendation from citizens in the Northern Forest region, it will benefit forest lands in all States. It's important because it allows for post-mortem donations of conservation easements for estate tax purposes, creates an estate tax alternative for heirs who choose to maintain the property as forest land for 25 years, provides a partial inflation adjustment for timber, creates an incentive for the sale of conservation easements to public agencies, and eliminates the 100-hour passive loss rule for forest land income. 
Mr. President, the Preservation Tax Act and the Stewardship Act are needed to relieve the pressure on forest land owners and provide incentives to maintain and protect the forests that so many work and enjoy. Both bills support the Northern Forest Council recommendations by promoting a sound foundation for a diversified economy and stable communities, opportunities for quality recreation, and long-term protection of the diversity of plant and animal species in the region. These bills are important steps in addressing the many interests in the Northern Forest region. Several years of participation and involvement from interested parties throughout the region have helped develop useful recommendations that recognize the diversified opportunities of one of the regions most important resources. 
It is my hope that both bills will move swiftly through the Senate and House and become law. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 1996-97 Middlebury College Hockey Team. The Panthers recently clinched their third consecutive NCAA Division III title. Not only did the team win a championship, but was also able to remain undefeated throughout the season. Their impressive performance is testimony to months of hard work and dedication. 
Vermonters take their hockey seriously and the success of Middlebury College's hockey team is not only a victory for the school, but the entire community as well. The players and coaches have represented themselves as well as Vermont admirably. I know that everyone associated with the team is proud of their achievements and we all look forward to another successful season next year under the continued tutelage of Coach Beaney. 
Once again, I would like to extend my best wishes and congratulations to the Middlebury College Hockey Team: Coach Bill Beaney, Assistant Coach Wes McKee, Francois Bourbeau, Jeff Anastasio, Erik Zink, Mathieu Bilodeau, Ryan Goldman, Sebastien Bilodeau, Emil Jattne, Mike Anastasio, Ben Barnett, Cam Petke, Nickolai Bobrov, Mark Spence, Francois Gravel, David Bracken, Peter Schneider, Curt Goldman, Brady Priest, Ross Sealfon, Mike Bay, Ray Turner, Jason Cawley, Chris Farion, Tim Fox, Jim Walsh, and John Giannacopoulos.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus on it's 100 years of service to its community. From its in-depth statewide political reporting, to its commitment to local news, to its independent editorial page, the `T. A.' has played a significant role in central Vermont's history. 
I salute the Times Argus for not only reaching this important milestone, but for inviting the entire central Vermont community to participate in its 100th anniversary celebration. The paper has scheduled an open house and guided tour of its facility and is sponsoring numerous theatrical and sports events this summer. In addition, later this year the Times Argus will be printing a centennial edition and is soliciting contributions from its readers about the history and personal impact of the newspaper and the community it covers. I know that I plan to take part in that endeavor. 
While much in the newspaper industry has changed since the Times Argus was formed on March 16, 1897, the one constant has been the newspaper's commitment to its readers and community. Again I congratulate the Times Argus on 100 wonderful years of service and wish another 100 years of continued success.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are here today to talk about the need for us to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and pass legislation to modernize the Food and Drug Administration. 
I will just remind everyone as to what happened last year. The Senate Labor Committee passed an FDA reform bill out of committee with a strong, bipartisan vote of 12-4. 
So we are here today to alert the body that we intend to move forward expeditiously this year in order to ensure that we improve the FDA review process for new products as well as reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. And we are going to do so in a bipartisan manner. 
Let me state that I intend that these issues will move together. It is my goal, as chairman of the authorizing committee, to have a bill ready for the full Senate's consideration before midyear. During the last Congress, my predecessor, Senator Kassebaum, led our committee in reporting out legislation which emphasizes the FDA has a role in bringing needed products to the public in a timely fashion as well as a role of protecting the public from harm. 
This year, I look forward to continuing that work. The objective of modernizing the FDA is to make more information and better products available to the public in an expeditious way, to foster and improve a new product review process, and require that the agency be as efficient and effective as possible in carrying out its statutorily defined duties. 
As chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, my approach will be to identify problem areas in the FDA regulatory system for drugs, devices, and other products which can be improved with legislation and gives the FDA the tools it needs to address other problems administratively. 
Specifically, we will target areas that have the effect of needlessly delaying patient access to safe new therapies and products. In addition, we must not squander scarce FDA resources on bureaucratic procedures which confer no demonstrated public health benefit. We must also reauthorize the successful Prescription Drug User Fee Act, also known as PDUFA. 
In 1992, the pharmaceutical and biotechnological industries were so concerned about the length of time taken by FDA to approve new drugs that they were willing to adopt FDA's proposal that they pay user fees in exchange for faster reviews. FDA has been able to reduce mean approval times for new drugs to which user fees were paid from almost 30 months in 1992 to 15.5 months in 1996. We need to continue this effort. 
Notwithstanding the success in reducing the review time for new drug applications, the period of time it takes pharmaceutical and biotechnological groups to work with FDA on the drug development phase before an application is even submitted has lengthened. It is my hope that we can introduce new performance measures for the FDA in addressing the drug development phase and further enhancing the drug review and approval phases as part of the reauthorization of PDUFA. 
It is essential to note that these user fees are contingent on the Appropriations Committee's making available to the FDA the pre-1992 level of appropriated funds to the Agency updated for inflation. This provides the assurance that user fees do not become a substitute for funds appropriated from general revenues. 
The administration's budget puts this important principle at risk with an 8-percent cut in the funding for the FDA. I know of Chairman Stevens' interest in the FDA and its approval process. I look forward to working with him, the other Appropriations Committee, and the majority leader to make sure that the FDA has the full level of funding it needs to perform its vital functions 
across each of the centers. 
Mr. President, the Labor and Human Resources Committee will move expeditiously to have the reauthorization of PDUFA and legislation to modernize the FDA ready for the consideration of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I know the Senator from Maryland is here and also wants to join myself and the majority leader in making sure that the Senate does what it must do in order to make the improvements necessary to bring the FDA up to what it can be and should be. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 22, our Nation will commemorate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the national nutrition programs for the elderly under the Older Americans Act. Since their inception, these programs have benefited thousands of our Nation's elderly by providing home-delivered and collective meals to those elderly facing serious challenges and limitations, including economic hardship, physical and health limitations, and rural isolation. 
The elderly's ability to obtain meals under the Older Americans Act was originally limited to meal sites, where groups of elderly can congregate for a meal during the day. Following several successful years of service, nutrition programs expanded to serve the home-bound elderly. Also, the parameters of the Older Americans Act were extended to allow Area Agencies on Aging to inform the elderly on how to obtain nutrition education, counseling, and screening. Nutritional services have proven to be critical for a significant population of the elderly who can continue to maintain a healthy, independent lifestyle. 
Through this program, Vermont's five Area Agencies on Aging contract with various local nutrition service providers to expedite the delivery of meals to people's homes and continue to coordinate meals provided in congregate settings. Federal grants provided for our country's nutrition programs fill resource gaps where non-profit and State organizations cannot. 
Twenty-five years following the first meal served in the early 1970's, 242 million meals have been provided to 3.5 million of our Nation's elderly. Since taking office in the House of Representatives in 1975, I am proud to have been a steadfast supporter of these nutrition programs. They are a wonderful example of the Federal Government's successful contribution to improving the lives of our Nation's senior citizens.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Arnold Aronson, a man that has spent his life working for a goal that is dear to my heart; an integrated, democratic, plural society in which every individual is accorded equal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice. 
Mr. Aronson began his work toward achieving his goal in a time when discrimination was overt and widespread in our country. Beginning in a one-person agency founded in 1941 to combat employment discrimination against people of the Jewish faith, Mr. Aronson eventually became the Secretary of the Leadership Council on Civil Rights, an organization dedicated to insuring equal rights to all segments of society. 
Under his guidance the Leadership Council was able to plan, coordinate and facilitate the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. His ability to recognize the strength of building coalitions in support of a common legislative goal was instrumental in the passage of all of these bills, and this belief helped assure that the tough decisions that had to be made did not fracture the coalition. 
Since 1985, Mr. Aronson has served as the President of the Leadership Conference Education Fund. Under his supervision, the Fund has increasingly focused on programs aimed at developing positive intergroup attitudes among young children. This focus has included a 10-year partnership with the Advertising Council of America aimed at developing public service announcements dealing with diversity and prejudice. As we all know, the children of today will be growing up into the teachers, doctors and Presidents of tomorrow. Discussing this topic with the children of today, should help us achieve our goal of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice for all. 
Mr. President, while not a household name in the battle for civil rights, Arnold Aronson deserves our recognition and high praise for his years of hard work fighting for civil rights for all. I remain hopeful that in the foreseeable future we will be able to achieve our goal of equal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice for all. 
I appreciate this opportunity to pay tribute to Arnold Aronson, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am introducing tax legislation designed to increase opportunities for the apple industry in the United States. I am pleased that Senators Leahy, D'Amato, and Moynihan are joining me as original cosponsors of the bill. 
Our bill clarifies the excise tax treatment of fermented apple cider. Current Federal tax law unfairly taxes fermented apple cider at a much higher rate than beer despite the two beverages similar alcohol levels. Currently, fermented apple cider, commonly known as draft cider, is subject to a tax of $1.07 per wine gallon, despite its alcohol level. This bill lowers the excise tax on draft cider containing not more than 7 percent alcohol to equal the beer tax rate of 22.6 cents per gallon. 
I believe this small tax change would allow draft cider producers to compete more fairly in the market with comparable beverages. As draft cider becomes more competitive the market will likely grow. This will greatly benefit the apple growers throughout this Nation, by expanding the use and need for their product. 
The production of draft hard cider comes from apples that are culls, processing apples or apples that are not usable in the fresh market. The conversion of culled apples into high value processed products such as draft cider is important to growers as well as to processors. 
Cider and other apple byproducts are important to Vermont's economy, providing a market for otherwise unmarketable fruit. Of Vermont's average annual crop of 1.1 million bushels, approximately 20 percent, or 220,000 bushels, are graded out as culls, or processing apples. Apple production has a long history in Vermont, and is an integral part of agriculture in our State as it is in many States. 
Many States have recognized the potential benefits to their apple farmers by lowering the tax on draft cider to equal the beer tax rate. State Departments of Agriculture, farm bureaus, and representatives from the apple industry across this Nation have voiced their support for lowering the cider tax rate. 
This bill that I introduce today is similar to legislation that I introduced along with my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, and my colleagues from New York in the last Congress. The same bill was successful in the Senate last Congress as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, H.R. 3448. Unfortunately, the language was not included in the conference report of H.R. 3448. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that this legislation will again pass in the Senate and be signed by the President. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my colleague. I will be very brief. I understand Senate Resolution 19, concerning the imprisonment of Tibetan ethnomusicologist Ngawang Choephel may be coming to the floor later in the day, and I want to speak in favor of it. It will be most useful if we pass this legislation, and I will be most pleased to vote for the passage of this legislation. 
This case has a special resonance in Vermont because Mr. Choephel was a Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College from 1993 to 1995, and has hundreds of friends throughout the State. He is well known as a talented and compassionate individual, who cares deeply about the culture of the Tibetan people. 
Indeed, it was while he was researching and recording traditional folk song and dance in Tibet in the fall of 1995 that he was arrested by the Chinese authorities and held incommunicado. It was over a year before the Chinese Government acknowledged in letters to me and other Members of Congress that he was in custody. 
The charges filed against him by the Chinese Government--that he was in Tibet to spy for the Dalai Lama, shocked and outraged those of us who know Ngawang well. His subsequent conviction at a secret trial and an incredible 18-year sentence are an injustice and have been widely and justifiably condemned by society in general. 
I hope this resolution will help to convince Beijing to reconsider its actions in this case, and to release Ngawang immediately and unconditionally. The Chinese Government needs to understand that its handling of this and other human rights cases, and its continued repression of the minority rights in Tibet, are serious setbacks to the Chinese-American relationship and make it difficult to pursue cooperation in other areas. 
I yield to my good colleague and friend from Vermont.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words today about the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC], which has been submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. 
Various aspects of this historic treaty are now being debated. However, I would maintain that one of the most important considerations for the Senate is how the CWC will affect our military forces in the field. Will it or will it not help reduce the threat of a poison gas attack against U.S. troops? As the Persian Gulf war demonstrated, this threat is real and must be addressed. 
After reviewing the accord, I have concluded that the CWC will indeed help to protect U.S. fighting forces from chemical attack. But don't just take my word for it, consider the opinion of several respected veterans groups and military associations who have come out in favor of the CWC, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Ex-Prisoners of War, AMVETS, the American G.I. Forum, the Korean War Veterans Association, the Jewish War Veterans of the U.S.A., and the National Association of Black Veterans.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Scenic Highway Protection Act, legislation that will control billboard blight and put a stop to the policies that have actually encouraged billboard construction and destroyed rural vistas across America. Every year hundreds of miles of rural scenery disappear, millions of taxpayer dollars are spent, and thousands of trees on public lands are unnecessarily cut. Why? Because billboards continue to proliferate along our Nation's highways. 
During debate on the National Highway System Act in 1995, billboard proponents pushed an amendment that would have forced States and localities to allow billboards on Federal aid highways. Fortunately, this proposal was defeated. My legislation attempts to give States the necessary tools to regulate and end the growth of billboards and protects the strict billboard controls enacted in Vermont and many other States. 
In the coming months, Congress will consider reauthorization of the Nation's transportation law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act. Proponents of billboard proliferation will most likely try again to override State billboard control laws. This time, we are prepared to enact legislation that will reduce and control billboards nationwide. My legislation will send a signal to billboard owners that America is ready to end uncontrolled billboard blight. 
The language in my bill will place a permanent freeze on the number of new billboards placed along Federal aid highways. for a new billboard to go up, an old one must come down. The legislation will also prohibit billboards in unzoned areas, eliminating the ability to randomly place billboards in rural America. My bill will end the practice of cutting trees on public lands for the sole purpose of better billboard visibility and reinstate the requirement that Federal and State funds be used to remove billboards when communities decide the sign violates local zoning laws. Finally, the legislation will place a 15-percent gross revenue tax on all billboards, ending the free ride for billboards. The money will be used to remove billboards in our Nation's most scenic areas. 
This legislation will move the 1965 Highway Beautification Act closer to its original intent of preserving the public's investment in our highways by protecting scenic areas and natural resources. Let us end the taxpayer subsidized proliferation of billboards.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I will vote to pass the balanced budget amendment. This is a vote for a stronger America, for responsible Government, and for our children. 
In 1982, I approached the constitutional amendment with a certain degree of skepticism. My vote against the amendment at that time reflected my belief that Congress could and would correctly eliminate our budget shortfall. Since that time, however, we have come to a point of national financial crisis. In 1982, we had a Federal debt of less than $1 trillion. This year, we have more than $5 trillion in Federal debt. This debt is crippling our Government's ability to solve our difficult problems. 
Like many, I wish there was a way to make Congress and the administration balance the budget without amending the Constitution. But we have tried, over and over and over, and we have failed. These measures have always fallen short. 
We must have in Washington what we take for granted in Montpelier, VT, and State capitals across the country--a balanced budget. 
This Congress must be remembered as the one that made life better in America.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am on the floor today to introduce legislation that will repeal section 217 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]. As enacted last year, this provision for the first time creates Federal criminal penalties for elders who transfer their assets and who subsequently apply for Medicaid but are deemed ineligible for nursing home benefits. 
I believe the goal to stop fraud and abuse in the Medicaid Program is laudable and must be pursued. However, there is a growing consensus that section 217 is a vague, unenforceable, criminal sanction misdirected at the elderly. It is unduly threatening to the Nation's senior citizens. We are sending the wrong message by implying there is something wrong or illegal with obtaining sound financial advice and estate planning to legitimately protect the assets that senior citizens have spent a lifetime accruing. 
During a recent hearing before the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, on the implementation of HIPAA, several concerns were raised about this issue. Ms. Gail Shearer, the director of health policy analysis of the Consumers Union, testified that section 217 was `leading to considerable alarm among seniors' and that she was `deeply troubled by the prospect of HIPAA leading to the transfer of elderly nursing home residents from their nursing home to prison.' 
At that same hearing, Mr. Bruce Vladek, the administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, pointed out that there is no evidence that large numbers of the elderly are impoverishing themselves to become Medicaid eligible. He expressed his belief that a few people doing something egregious can create the perception of a widespread problem. It is especially unclear how pervasive this practice is, particularly in light of actions already taken by Congress to curb these asset transfers. 
Repeal of section 217 would not affect several other restrictions now on the books designed to close loopholes and stop the inappropriate transfer of assets. People found to have transferred nonexempt assets within a look-back period are determined ineligible and denied Medicaid nursing home assistance for the period over which their assets would have paid. The look-back period for asset transfers is 36 months, with a 60-month period for trusts. States are also required to establish estate recovery programs to compensate for nursing home services paid for by the Medicaid Program. 
There is no systematic study that has determined or recommended that the addition of criminal sanctions to the penalties which already exist are necessary to address inappropriate asset transfers by the elderly. In the absence of a demonstrated need for criminal penalties, we believe that section 217 holds the potential to do more harm than good. 
No one really wants to send Granny to jail. In fact, it has been reported that the intended targets of section 217 are those who have created a cottage industry, and made substantial sums of money, from advising the elderly on how to transfer their assets to become Medicaid eligible. Ironically, section 217 has had the opposite effect. Recent newspaper ads placed by these advisers from Portland, ME, to Phoenix, AZ, now use this very law to drum up business. The bold-print headlines of these ads read: 
Sneaky New Law Buried in the Health Insurance Bill Can Put Unsuspecting Seniors and Retirees Behind Bars!, and You Only Have Until December 31st, 1996, To Avoid Making the Mistake That Could Toss You in Jail . . . Congress' Sneaky New Law Is the Most Vicious Attack on Retirees Yet! 
Mr. President, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid Program must not be tolerated, and taxpayers should not have to pay nursing home bills for persons who have the wherewithal to pay for their own care. But neither should confusing, unenforceable laws be in place that impose Federal criminal penalties on elderly individuals where there is no clear understanding of what does and what does not constitute a criminal activity. 
Organizations urging repeal of the provision include: the American Association of Retired Persons, the Alzheimer's Association, the Leadership Council on Aging--a group of more than 40 national organizations in the field of aging--and the American Bar Association. 
I believe that we in the Congress owe it to our senior citizens to stop their needless anxiety over this misdirected, confusing law. We need to repeal section 217. I urge my colleagues to join me in repealing this unnecessary and unworkable law.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today works to end the illegal killing of rare and endangered species that are close to extinction. These species include rhinos, tigers, bears, and many other animals that are slaughtered for senseless reasons. The bill, titled the Rhino and Tiger Product Labeling Act, seeks to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to prohibit the sale of products labeled as containing endangered species. 
Since 1970, the world's population of rhinos has declined by 90 percent. Among the 5 species of rhinos, fewer than 11,000 individual rhinos exist in the wild. Tigers are facing a similar fate. At the turn of the century, as many as 100,000 tigers lived in the wild. Today, less than 5,000 tigers remain. Three subspecies are already extinct, and the remaining five subspecies are found only in sparse pockets of Asia. 
The greatest threat to the existence of rhinos and tigers in the wild continues to be the high demand for products containing rhino horn and tiger parts. The prohibition of the illegal trade in endangered species parts has not been well enforced in most Asian countries, where rhino and tiger products are valued for their medicinal value. Although the primary market for these illegal products continues to be in Asia, a large market has developed here in America. 
Investigators have found that in the United States, the trade in endangered species continues to be widely practiced. Many pharmacies in Los Angeles and New York offer rhino and tiger products for sale--a strong indication that it is time for the United States to concentrate on its role as a consumer nation of endangered species parts and products. In a recent survey, investigators found that 80 percent of pharmacies and supermarkets in New York's Chinatown district had tiger products openly for sale. Many of these products were imported from China. Demand for such products here in the United States is leading directly to the elimination of these species in their native habitat overseas. This trade must end. 
To curb this trade we need effective labeling laws and we must ban all products containing or claiming to contain ingredients derived from endangered species. Many products which advertise ingredients such as rhino horn or tiger parts do not even contain trace amount of these endangered species. However, the mere fact that they are on store shelves leads to increased demand for the real stuff. In addition, these products have been tested in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration and have been found to contain toxic metals that are harmful to human health if taken in the doses found in many traditional medicines. A ban on products containing ingredients from endangered species as well as those claiming to contain endangered species parts is vital to protect human health and to maintain the few remaining rhinos, tigers and bears in their wild habitat. 
My legislation will make it illegal to even intend to sell a product containing an endangered species. Today, Fish and Wildlife investigators are overwhelmed trying to control the illegal sale of endangered species parts and products. This bill will allow investigators to completely halt the sale of products labeled as containing endangered species. 
I am strong proponent of the protection and conservation of endangered species. If we do not act now, future generations will not be able to enjoy many of the species of wildlife now in existence. Currently there are insufficient legal mechanisms enabling the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to forcefully interdict and confiscate products that are labeled as containing endangered species and to prosecute the merchandisers once the products are on store shelves. This bill seeks to close a significant loophole in the illegal trade in products containing or claiming to contain ingredients from endangered species. My hope is that this legislation, when passed in the 105th Congress, will help curb the escalating trade in wildlife and endangered species parts and stem the decrease in the populations of some of the Earth's most magnificent animals.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of House Joint Resolution 36, which would approve the President's finding that the congressionally imposed delay in disbursement of international population funding is having a negative impact on the effectiveness of our population planning programs overseas. 
I have been a strong supporter of international family planning assistance and see this measure now before us as an important test of our Government's commitment to these important, lifesaving programs. 
Claims that this resolution somehow promotes abortion are completely unfounded. This resolution is about the health of women and children in the desperately poor corners of the world, and, if anything, it is about preventing abortion. 
At issue here is whether to begin releasing funds March 1, or delay the disbursement for another 4 months, until July 1. The 1997 fiscal year began October 1, but under the terms of the fiscal year 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act, funding for this particular program was delayed for 9 months. Regardless of the outcome of this vote, a total of $385 million will be spent on bilateral family planning programs. In other words, we are not debating if these funds will be spent, but when they will begin to be released--July 1 or March 1. 
I would like to point out that an additional 4-month delay in funding would result in an actual reduction of $123 million in funds available for programming during fiscal year 1997. The President's finding states that at least 17 bilateral and worldwide programs will have urgent funding needs in the March-June period which cannot be met by remaining fiscal year 1996 funds. If fiscal year 1997 funds are withheld until July 1, these programs would need to suspend, defer, or terminate family planning services and other critical supporting activities. 
The continued disruption and possible termination of family planning services would have a devastating impact on the health of women, children, and their families in many parts of the world. Medical research shows that women who are able to space their children in at least 2-year intervals have children that are less likely to die at a very early age. Children born less than 2 years apart are more likely to have a low birth weight, making them more vulnerable to disease and illness. Moreover, births too close together affect older children in the family as well. Infection, malnutrition, and dehydration result from premature discontinuation of breast-feeding. The inadequate nutrition, sanitation, and crowded living conditions often found in poor countries, increase the likelihood that already vulnerable children will succumb to illness. For the health of their families, women in these circumstances turn to family planning services, when they can get them. 
UNICEF estimates that each year 600,000 women die of pregnancy-related causes, and 75,000 of these deaths are the result of self-induced, unsafe abortion. UNICEF also estimates that these women leave behind at least 1 million motherless children. In short, to continue to obstruct and delay family planning assistance is to contribute to the deaths of women and young children. Why would we delay the release of funds until July 1 when we could prevent more needless, tragic deaths by releasing funds March 1? 
Mr. President, no Senator in this body wants to promote policies that increase the incidence of abortion overseas. But by continuing to delay funding to clinics in the poorest countries in the world, that's exactly what we are doing--shutting off women from the only possibility they have of obtaining family planning services and contraception and forcing them to consider abortion as a last, desperate option. 
Very simply, to vote against this resolution is to vote against the health of women and children, and to force more women to have abortions. I do not believe this is the true intention of the Senate and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing, together with a number of my colleagues, the Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of 1997. This bill is identical to the TEAM Act approved by the Senate last year. 
This bill responds to a series of decisions by the National Labor Relations Board which have cast doubt on the legality of many forms of workplace cooperation. Specifically, the Board held in the Electromation case that certain employer-employee committees violated the National Labor Relations Act's prohibition against employer-assisted labor organizations. 
This ruling has had a chilling effect on some 30,000 companies that have employee involvement programs. The TEAM Act amends Federal labor law to allow voluntary workplace cooperation to continue. The legislation allows employers and employees to meet together to address issues of mutual interest, including issues related to quality, productivity, and efficiency as long as the committees or other joint programs do not engage in collective bargaining. 
This last point is important. The bill does not allow employers to establish company unions or sham unions that undermined independent collective bargaining back in the 1930's. Under the TEAM Act, workers retain the right, as well they should, to choose an independent union to engage in collective bargaining. 
More importantly, the TEAM Act gives workers the opportunity for greater input and involvement in the workplace. Not only does this allow workers to improve and expand their skills, but workplace cooperation also increases our productivity and competitive edge in the global marketplace. 
This bill received bipartisan support in the last Congress, and I am confident it will again this year. This bill is not about labor versus management. It's about clarifying the law so that workers and management can work together to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of our economy as a whole. I look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle so that the TEAM Act becomes law in the very near future.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I join Senator Leahy today in paying tribute to Vermont's new chief justice, Jeffrey L. Amestoy. Jeff is a good friend and a great Vermonter, and I know he will serve in his new post with distinction and honor. 
Jeff Amestoy and I have shared many life experiences. We were both raised in Rutland, VT. He served as an assistant attorney general under my stewardship as Vermont's attorney general in the early 1970's. And now, over 20 years later, he is serving in the position that my father, Olin Jeffords, once held: chief justice of the Vermont supreme court. 
As someone who has known Jeff for over 25 years, I can attest to his judicial knowledge, his keen sense of Vermont values, his modest demeanor and his dedication to the people of Vermont. 
I was fortunate to be able to attend the swearing-in ceremony for Jeff last Friday in Montpelier. It was a wonderful event, one that I will never forget. Jeff's comments were from the heart and I am pleased to join Senator Leahy in offering them today as part of the Record.

 Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, Abraham, and Lieberman in sponsoring the Community Empowerment Act of 1997, which will encourage the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites known as brownfields in Vermont and across the country. 
The term `brownfields' refers to contaminated industrial sites. Most of these sites were abandoned during the 1970's and 1980's, as industrial development migrated away from urban areas to the greener landscape of the suburbs. One such site in Vermont is the Holden-Leonard Mill, a 20-building complex in Bennington, VT, that is poised to become a brownfields success story after 10 years of work. 
Once employing one-quarter of Bennington's work force, the mill shut down in 1939 and then was owned by a patchwork of owners until the 1980's. After soil tests disclosed high levels of pollutants, the mill sat empty after 1986. Fortunately, a buyer of the site came forward in 1992 and with cooperation between the business, State agencies, and the EPA the mill has been refurbished and over 200 new employees have been hired. The process, however, of revitalizing this site began in 1986 and is still going on. 
Our aim with this legislation is to provide tax incentives to businesses willing to clean up and redevelop brownfields sites so that more brownfield sites can be returned to productive use and so that the process doesn't have to take 10 years. 
Last November, I sponsored a forum on brownfields redevelopment in Burlington, VT. There is only one unpolluted site in Burlington available for industrial development. Yet there are currently 17 brownfields sites in the city, all with great potential for development. I toured several of these sites and saw this potential first hand. Burlington is both an EPA brownfields pilot city and an enterprise community. Under our legislation, businesses that acquire these sites would be able to claim tax deductions for their environmental cleanup costs. With tax incentives for brownfields redevelopment, I am hoping that we will see more of these abandoned sites returned to productive use. 
We treasure our open spaces in Vermont, and we are looking at ways to give incentives to companies to invest in our downtowns. When a company builds a facility on a brownfield site it takes advantage of existing infrastructure. the revitalization of a brownfield site means one less farm or field is paved over or forest cut down for the sake of a new plant or facility. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, last Thursday 48 Senators representing the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I chair with Senator Moynihan, my colleague from Vermont Senator Leahy, and Senators from other States hard hit by skyrocketing heating prices and cold weather, sent a letter to President Clinton asking him to release $300 million in emergency low income home energy assistance funds [LIHEAP]. 
The 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act allows the President to release up to $420 million in LIHEAP emergency funds. In the Northeast and Midwest, the price of home heating oil has jumped over 25 percent from last year, while natural gas and propane prices in all cold weather States are significantly higher. The Reverend Dr. Robert E. Martin of Newport, VT recently wrote me that the propane bill of the Lowell Congregational Church has risen 52 percent over last year. Any distribution of emergency LIHEAP funds must take into account this rise in fuel prices, which in Vermont, so far, has been worse than the weather. 
Mr. President, the rising cost of energy weighs heavy on low-income working Americans who devote about 12 percent of their income to energy bills. The elderly and disabled low-income individuals relying on supplemental security income spend on average 19 percent of that income on energy bills, and families with children living on Aid to Families With Dependent Children devote almost 25 percent of their benefits to energy bills. 
Although many State regulations prohibit utilities from terminating service for nonpayment during the winter, households that rely on home heating oil, propane, and wood do not have this same safety net. These households must pay for services up front or face fuel cut offs. With the prolonged spike in fuel prices, additional Federal funds are needed to prevent many families from having to face life threatening cold this winter. 
Mr. President, freezing temperatures and high fuel prices are a recipe for disaster for low-income Americans. Forty-eight Senators from both parties are urging President Clinton to act quickly so that low-income Americans do not have to choose between heating and eating this winter. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor for others who desire to speak on this important issue. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I introduce the National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 1997. This bill is identical to legislation that Senator Hatfield and I have introduced in past Congresses. I introduce this bill again today because I firmly believe that deposit laws are a common sense, proven method to increase recycling, save energy, create jobs, and decrease the generation of waste and proliferation of overflowing landfills. 
The experience of 10 States, including Vermont, attest to the success of a deposit law or bottle bill as it is commonly called. Recycling rates of well over 70 percent have been achieved for beverage containers in bottle bill States. The rate is over 90 percent in Vermont. To put this in perspective, consider this: 30 percent of Americans who live in bottle bill States account for over 80 percent of beverage container recycling in this country. 
The concept of a national bottle bill is simple: To provide the consumer with an incentive to return the container for reuse or recycling. Consumers pay a nominal cost per bottle when purchasing a beverage and are refunded their money when they bring the bottle back either to a retailer or redemption center. Retailers are paid a fee for their participation in the program, and any unclaimed deposits are used to finance State environmental programs. 
Under my proposal, a 10-cent deposit on beer, water, and soft-drink containers would take effect in States which have beverage container recovery rates of less than 70 percent, the minimum recovery rate achieved by existing bottle bill States. Labels showing the deposit value would be affixed to containers, and retailers would receive a 2-cent fee per container for their participation in the program. 
We are constantly reminded of the growing problem of excess waste as we hear news reports of waste washing up on our Nation's beaches, pitched battles over the siting of landfills and communities lacking adequate waste disposal facilities. Our country's solid waste problems are very real, and they will continue to haunt us until we take action. The throw-away ethic that has emerged in this country is not insurmountable, and recycling is part of the solution. 
Finally, a national bottle bill serves a much greater purpose than merely cleaning up littered highways. Recycling creates jobs, saves energy, and preserves our Nation's precious natural resources. In fact, the demand for recycled glass and aluminum has grown to such a point that the Chicago Board of Trade now sells futures in these materials. Recycling makes good business sense. 
The legislation I introduce today is consistent with our Nation's solid waste management objectives. A national bottle bill would reduce solid waste and litter, save natural resources and energy, and create a much needed partnership between consumers, industry, and local governments. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. JEFFORDS. 
Mr. President, with my colleague, Senator Frist, I am introducing the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. This legislation is identical to S. 1578, which was reported out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee in the last Congress. Senator Frist did a tremendous job in assisting, getting that prepared and passed out of committee. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass in the last legislative session. 
We are introducing this legislation today so everyone will have a common frame of reference. However, I want to make it very clear to my colleagues in the Senate and to my colleagues and friends within the education and disability community across the Nation that this legislation is not perfect and it can and will be improved. This is the beginning of the process, not the end. 
I am well aware that there are still issues to be resolved and I intend to work with my colleagues to examine these issues and to move forward with revisions to this important law that are commonsense solutions to issues which are very real at the local school level. 
We are aided in this effort by the majority leader, who is committed to helping us achieve the broadest based consensus on a final project, one that has the support of families of children with disabilities and educators, but also of all Members of Congress and the President. We have set an ambitious schedule for completing our work on IDEA, and by introducing the IDEA Amendments of 1997 today, we are taking a very important first step. 
IDEA was originally enacted in 1975. I was a Member of the House at the time, and participated in the development of this landmark law. It was a response to court decisions that created a patchwork of legal standings, which in turn generated considerable uncertainty about rights and responsibilities. IDEA guaranteed each child with a disability access to a free, appropriate public education, and we all support that goal. In that sense, the legislation has clearly stood the test of time. But it has not in terms of the level of funding support that we promised to the States to assist them in meeting their obligation to educate children with disabilities. 
In IDEA, Congress promised to contribute 40 percent of the cost of educating children with disabilities. Our colleague, Senator Gregg, has kept our feet to the fire, reminding us that we should keep our promise. In last year's appropriations measure we were able to garner large increases for this program. We must continue our effort to reach our full Federal commitment. 
After 22 years, I think it is appropriate to thoroughly review the administrative and fiscal demands that are associated with providing a free appropriate education to children with disabilities. The population of students demanding assistance has changed significantly, but the law has not provided enough flexibility to States to meet those changing demands. 
The writing is on the wall. If we do not make needed changes to IDEA now, based on common sense, school districts and parents will increasingly turn to the courts to get the answers. School districts will do so in hope of getting relief from or clarification of their responsibilities. The parents will do so in hope of procuring the services that they believe their child needs. Since the genesis of IDEA lay in avoiding litigation, true to its intent to do so today, we have an opportunity, through the reauthorization of IDEA, to ensure the emphasis will shift once again and remain on educating children, well into the next century. 
If we work together, we have the power to ease the pressure on local communities and States. Through the reauthorization of IDEA, we have the power to give educators incentives and opportunities to educate children with disabilities, including those at risk of failing, with less bureaucracy and meaningful accountability. Let us do it now.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for all the work he has done. He deserves, and should get, accolades and helpful attention to this bill, because we do need help in making sure it gets into law. But the work he did last year has been incredibly helpful. It moves us a long way toward that goal.

Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of S. 4, the `Family Friendly Workplace Act of 1997.' This legislation is designed to address the very pressing and legitimate needs of working families for more flexibility in their workplaces. 
We all know how difficult it is for working parents to balance the demands of work and family responsibilities. There are soccer games, parent-teacher conferences, and doctor's appointments that demand a few hours of time during the workweek. Our workplace laws should allow workers the flexibility to work a few extra hours one week, in order to take time off later when they need to for family or personal reasons. 
Ironically, current law inhibits more flexible schedules and compensation programs. While this may come as a surprise, it is really not all that hard to understand why. The world of the workplace has undergone a revolution in the last 60 years. 
In the 1930's, as the Roosevelt administration and the Congress sought to establish minimum wage and overtime standards, the last thing on their minds was finding free time for workers. With as much as one-third of the work force unemployed, the problem was far too much free time, not too little. The purpose of premium pay for overtime work was not to enrich already-employed workers, but to spread work to the unemployed, in effect reducing free time. 
The story of a woman from Poultney, Vermont, near my home town, brought this home to me. She was employed as a school teacher in the midst of the Depression, and had the further good fortune to fall in love and get married to a man who was also employed. Upon her marriage, she quickly resigned from her job. When asked why decades later, she explained it was simply understood that you would not have two full-time jobs in one family. 
Such taboos today are little more than an interesting historical footnote. With the rise of single parent families and two-parent families in which both spouses work, it is incredibly difficult to balance the demands of work and family. That difficulty is increased by the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] which was not designed with today's circumstances in mind. The law's minimum wage and overtime protections are just as important today as they were when enacted, but the law needs to be adjusted to the workplace of the 21st century. 
For example, the FLSA bars private employers from offering employees the choice of receiving overtime in the form of compensatory time off instead of cash wages. While Federal and public sector workers have had this option since 1985, private sector workers do not. Many employees do not necessarily want money as much as time to address family needs. A recent public opinion poll conducted by Penn & Schoen Associates found that workers strongly favor more flexibility in their work schedules. Seventy-five percent of those surveyed said they would prefer the option to choose to be compensated for overtime with compensatory time off or cash overtime. 
Now some of my colleagues may be familiar with what seems to be a contradictory poll conducted by Lake Research which found that nearly two-thirds of poll respondents opposed the policy we propose. Frankly, I would, too, if it was anything like what was described in the poll's question. 
The Lake Research poll describes compensatory time off as the employer's decision. It is not. It describes biweekly scheduling as the employer's decision. It is not. Indeed, the poll's question concludes by saying: Employers could schedule you to work 60 hours one week and 20 hours the next, but you would not earn overtime pay. Do you support or oppose such a policy? 
It comes as no surprise that most people would not support such a policy. As my colleagues know, you can structure a question on a poll to yield just about any result you want. This is a pretty good example of just that. 
What is interesting to me is that even when faced with such a slanted presentation, one-third of the people either supported such a policy or were unsure. It stands to reason that when presented with the facts--that is, that each of these proposals is predicated on the employee's decision, not the employer's--three quarters of Americans support having the option of taking time off instead of cash. 
This bill incorporates provisions which passed the House of Representatives last year that would allow the payment of overtime with compensatory time off at a rate of 1.5 hours for each hour worked over 40 in a workweek. Just like in the public sector, however, no employee could be forced to accept comp time off instead of being paid for overtime. A written agreement between the employer and the employee is required, and there are strong penalties against any employer who coerces, intimidates, or threatens workers into accepting such an agreement. 
Not all employees want to work a traditional 8-hour day, 5 days a week, with no variation. Some employees would prefer to trade hours between weeks--e.g. work 45 hours one week, 35 hours the next and take every other Friday off--or shift to a schedule that compresses many hours at the front end of the week so that they can put together several days off later. However, companies would have to pay workers overtime for any hours over 40 in the first week, even if the employee would prefer to flex his or her schedule. Currently, only Federal workers can flex their schedules without their employer being subject to the overtime penalty.
