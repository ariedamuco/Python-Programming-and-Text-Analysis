Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I would like to call attention to a small but very important issue that was not addressed in the appropriations bill that was considered today. In short, Congress has not provided the necessary funding to HHS to track what happens to families who have been dropped from the welfare caseloads. 
Back in April when the Senate passed the budget resolution, it included an amendment that I offered directing HHS to determine whether former welfare recipients are achieving `economic self-sufficiency' once they stop receiving benefits. But a budget resolution was never adopted by Congress. I ask all my colleagues, why don't we want to know what is happening to families after they leave welfare? Are we afraid of what we might find? 
So many of my colleagues keep talking about the success of reform, citing the dramatic drop in the number of caseloads. But I ask you, do we know where those families are? Are they better off? Have they achieved economic self-sufficiency? Or are they more deeply enmeshed in poverty? Why are we not interested in finding answers to these questions? As policy makers it is our duty and our responsibility to make sure that the policies we enact for the good of the people actually are doing good for the people. But if we don't go and find out how they are actually affecting families, how will we know? We need to put in place the means to address these very critical questions, and directing HHS to set up a means of evaluating what happens to families is the most common sense way to approach this issue. 
Evaluation is one of the key ingredients in good policy making and it does not take a degree in political science to realize what anyone with good common sense knows: if we want to try something new, we need to assess how that new program works. Now when Congress enacted welfare reform, the goals as I understood them were to move people off of welfare and dependency and into jobs and economic self-sufficiency. The dropping number of caseloads implies that we have met only part of the first goal--moving families off of welfare. But eliminating dependency and achieving economic self-sufficiency through a job that supports a family are effects that can only be determined over a longer period of time. As policy makers--regardless of ideological stripe--it is our role to ensure that the programs that Congress enacts to provide for American families' well-being are effective and produce the goals we intended them to. We need to know what is happening with the families who are affected by the new reform, whether it is in fact effectively helping low income mothers and their children build a path to economic self-sufficiency. 
What we do know, what everyone knows is that the caseloads have dropped dramatically--1.3 million families have left welfare since August of 1996 alone, that is 4.5 million total recipients including mothers and their children. But what that number tells us is only a snapshot of the broader picture. 
I want to take a moment to talk about this number and what it tells us. First of all, we have to recognize how naive it is to assume that all 1.3 million of those families are finding jobs and moving towards a life of economic self-sufficiency, because that number only tells us about families that have been dropped from the caseload--and families drop from the caseloads for many different reasons. A family may lose their benefits due to sanctions, or they may leave welfare on their own, for many reasons which we do not know. Even more troubling is that although the number of families receiving welfare has declined, indicators of poverty have not shown a similar or equal rate of decline, which means that many families who are eligible for assistance are not even applying. 
Even among families where the parent has found a job--because without it they would not be receiving any assistance--we know very little. We do not know how long those jobs are lasting or whether they are the kind of jobs that will put families on a path to economic self-sufficiency. Just because a parent finds a job does not mean that the family is no longer poor. Getting a job that pays a family wage, that enables a mother to provide a life for her children that lifts them all out of poverty does not happen overnight. We need to know what happens to families 6 months, 12 months, even a couple of years down the road. And we do not know that. 
No one seems to know, even those members of Congress who keep trumpeting the `victory' of welfare reform. Just a few weeks ago, in the Conference Committee for the Higher Ed. bill, I asked my colleagues if they knew of any research demonstrating that these 1.3 million families had indeed achieved economic self-sufficiency and no one had an answer for me. No one! Let me just say that accepting a very narrow measure of what has happened to 1.3 million families is no victory in my book. 
Each family is more than a number, more than another tally mark to be added to that statistic of 1.3 million caseloads. Adding up that tally does not answer critical questions. Questions like why did that family stop receiving benefits? Was it due to an increased income from the mother's job? If yes, then what kind of wages is that mother now making? Does she have a job that is going to enable her to continue to provide for her family, or will the next crisis of a sick child, a broken down car, or some other unforeseen problem push her back to needing assistance? We have very little information about the situations of these 1.3 million families. We are in the dark because we turned off the lights. 
Now, let me back up a minute and provide my colleagues with some background on this issue of asking the necessary questions about the impact of welfare reform. Requiring states to evaluate the impact of new welfare policies is not new. Not at all. In fact, prior to enacting the 1996 reform, all states that applied for a waiver to try an experiment with their AFDC program--and 43 out of 50 states had been granted waivers by 1996--were required under the regulations of the waiver to hire an outside contractor to evaluate the impact of their new program. For 
example, in Minnesota, two of the primary criteria for evaluating the programs were whether the program `helped families increased their income and self-sufficiency' and `supported families' movement toward self-support.' 
But when Congress enacted TANF, states were no longer required to continue those evaluations. In fact, 24 states stopped the evaluation process altogether, and only 19 have applied for funds to continue those evaluations. That means that over half of the states ended their project evaluations when Congress dropped the requirement to assess the impact of reform. 
Of course these projects that I have just mentioned are not the only evaluations of the new reform. When states begin to apply to HHS for the $1 billion in bonus money for successfully moving families into self-sufficiency, they will be required to report on the status of both current and former recipients. Then, HHS will have some information about what is happening. But that information will not be available until at least the Fall of 1999. 
Last year Congress considered this issue important, since we specifically earmarked $5 million in the FY98 Labor-HHS appropriations for HHS to give to states interested in doing their own tracking studies. And just a few weeks ago, HHS announced it had awarded grants to 13 state and county projects to track `leavers'--those who have been dropped from the caseloads due to increased earnings or sanctions, and those who have not even applied for assistance even though they are eligible. This is an example of responsible policy making, and I will be very interested in the outcomes of these evaluations. But in a year's time, these 13 projects will be cut off at the knees. These projects will be unable to complete their planned evaluations because they will not have the necessary funds. Why? Because Congress has failed to appropriate similar funds for FY99. I ask you again, what are we afraid of? 
We do have some information, but it is not very helpful. You might not want to know about it, but I'm going to talk about it anyway, because I want to illustrate that what information we do have is very, very limited. 
Recently released reports give us some idea of what is happening, but there are huge holes in what we do know. The good news is that many states--31 according to the National Conference of State Legislatures--are conducting various types of tracking studies on their own. The bad news is that these studies are wildly diverse in terms of who they track, how long they track recipients, and when their reports will be available to the public. 
Let me just give you a snapshot of what this kind of tracking system looks like. The studies run the gamut from those examining all closed cases, to only sanctioned cases, to cases closed due to increased earnings, to families diverted from ever applying for assistance. And the time frames of the studies range from 6 months to five years and everything in between. 
But the really frustrating thing about what appears to be a potential wealth of data is that there is no central clearinghouse for it. As I mentioned before, HHS received a special $5 million appropriation for FY98 to fund some tracking studies. But the funds were only to provide help to states to do their own tracking. It did not provide funds so that HHS could act as a central location for analyzing the results of these studies. So, while I was glad that Congress committed necessary resources to studying what happens to families after they leave welfare, that is only part of the job. We need an efficient means of analyzing the information that we do collect, and directing HHS to serve as a central clearinghouse would have been the best way of doing that. 
There are other problems with this scatter-shot approach to tracking. One of them is that it does not allow us to trace what happens to families that get sanctioned. Do they get caught up in a `churning' cycle, getting sent to the end of the line, deepening the hardship of an already poor family? One study in Iowa of families that had been sanctioned found that only 30% were working 30 hours a week or more and almost half of them had experienced a dramatic decrease in their income (over $380 per month). 
From several studies, in New Jersey, Iowa, and Tennessee, it seems that many families who are being dropped from welfare due to sanctions are turning to other family members for assistance. A study in New Jersey showed that almost 50% of the families that were sanctioned and lost their benefits turned to family for aid; in Tennessee, 71% sought help from other family members. While I understand the intent of welfare reform was to decrease families' dependency on welfare, I do not think--and I am confident that my colleagues agree--that it was Congress's intent to shift the burden of assistance to other low income families who are just keeping their own heads above water. 
Families that get sanctioned are at least within the state's data base and are easier to track. The groups that we really know very little about are those families in need who never even make it onto the official welfare roles. Many families are discouraged from even applying for aid or get diverted by receiving a lump sum of 2 or 3 months of benefits. In New York City--in Brooklyn and Queens--the primary goal of city welfare offices, according to its official manual, is to discourage families from even applying for assistance by encouraging them to get a job or depend on relatives. 
While this may initially save the state money and reduce its caseloads, shifting the need of mothers and their children to other family members spreads individual resources more thinly and risks expanding the number of families in poverty. More disturbing is that this phenomenon does not appear to be only happening in New York. I think this is a very troubling trend that seems to be attached to these groups, one that I want to bring to my colleagues' attention because I think it will have greater implications for all low-income working families. 
As I have mentioned, very little research looks at the long term impact of reform, and most of the studies I have mentioned above are short-term studies. But a program in Oregon is often cited as one to emulate. I would like to take a moment here to tell my colleagues about this particular program, because I think this case shows us the importance of getting more information than just the number of recipients dropped from the caseloads. 
Unlike other welfare to work programs that focused on recipients just getting a job--any job--the Portland program provided really strong support services to help families find a `good' job, a full-time job that paid above minimum wage, included medical benefits and the potential for advancement. The way that the Portland program did this was to take a `mixed services' approach. And what that translates into is what I would think would be a good job search program for anyone, whether they were on welfare or not. 
First, staff assessed the skills and interests of recipients, and then they worked closely with individual recipients to help them plan a strategy for getting what they needed to find a good job. Those folks that needed educational or vocational training were sent to do that. Training also included programs that helped parents who needed some life skills training to improve their employability. And as recipients were participating in these programs, program staff worked closely with local companies and employers to match recipients with good jobs where they would succeed. 
For many families, this approach worked to get them jobs that did pay higher than the minimum wage at the time ($4.15), and many were still at their jobs at the end of two years. But, there is a finer point that needs to be made about what appears to be good news in this study. The jobs that parents got were higher than minimum wage, but they were still only $6 an hour at the most. Well, that just isn't enough for a family of three--a mother and two children, which is what the average family on welfare consists of--to make ends meet. And the bigger downside is that although many families were able to leave welfare, 40% of families were still receiving cash assistance at the end of two years. 
Even if we were to be optimistic about the potential for these $6 an hour jobs to translate into job advancement and greater earnings, what about the other 40% who still needed cash assistance? We cannot be celebrating welfare reform as a `success' when so many former recipients have jobs that only move them to just beyond the eligibility line for cash assistance but do not set them on that path to economic self-security. And, probably more importantly, we need to know more about the specific barriers that keep those 40% of families from getting a `good job' too. We just cannot walk away from them. 
As I mentioned, the program in Portland is unusual compared to other welfare-to-work programs. On the other end of the spectrum are programs like Wisconsin Works, better known as W-2. With the W-2 program, the basic premise is that parents will not get cash assistance unless they are working. This kind of program moves parents into the work force very quickly, because they need that cash assistance. But what a recent study of Milwaukee families found was that even though parents are getting jobs quickly, 6 months later three quarters of them were no longer employed. And of those parents who did get jobs, only 14% were getting paid full time wages. That means that less than 2 out of 10 families had a parent who was working full time. 
This is very disturbing information. What is happening to these families who are getting pushed into the work force so quickly that they are not given the opportunity or the training to find jobs that are more likely to translate into sustained, full-time employment. Based on this study, it is very clear to me that we as policy makers definitely need to know about how other `work first' approaches are affecting families. When less than 2 out of 10 families has a parent bringing home a full time wage, there are a lot of families who are not making ends meet, and that is not a success in my book. 
Looking at the administrative side, we know that since the caseloads have dropped dramatically, states have more funds available to provide support services to families trying to find jobs. However, the 1.3 million drop in caseloads is only a drop in the number of families receiving cash assistance; many of those families are still receiving other support services such as subsidized child care, transportation, housing and medical care. When the labor market hits a downturn--which is the direction it appears to be heading--and many families are forced to return for cash assistance, what will happen to the states' ability to provide these support services necessary to put those mothers back in the workforce? There is much uncertainty about the future and we are doing little to reduce it. 
Even those of my colleagues who supported the 1996 welfare reform bill must recognize Congress's important responsibility of finding out what is happening to those 1.3 million families who have been dropped from the roles. Reform is not a one-shot deal. Real reform involves long term oversight to insure that policies benefit all parties: states and poor mothers and their children. 
I have always said, the true test of welfare reform will come in the austere economic times, when many more families will need it most. Will we wait until folks are again in dire straits before we begin to gather information about how to correct the programs that we have just reformed? Are we really going to allow ourselves to be so short-sighted? Or will we recognize that our responsibility to enact good policies that protect our most vulnerable populations such as poor mothers and their children is intrinsic to our duty as good and effective policy makers. Not until we are sure that this reform has accomplished all of its goals-- eliminating dependency and helping families to establish and maintain economic self-sufficiency--can we truly claim that this reform is good and sound policy for all.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator, and commend him for his support on this very important issue. I also wish to thank my friend, Senator McCain, for joining me last year in sponsoring the Udall Act. 
I believed when we passed the Udall Act last year we had begun to change a sad history of chronic underfunding of Parkinson's by the NIH. It was a very personal victory for me--and for all those who fought so hard to see the Udall Act enacted into law. 
I am here today, along with my colleagues, in an effort to fulfill the promise of the Udall Act and the commitment we in Congress made to people with Parkinson's, their families and those researchers dedicated to curing this disease. I find it very disheartening to learn that so little of the research NIH claims to devote to Parkinson's is actually Parkinson's-focused as called for by the Utall Act. it was our intent and it is our obligation to ensure that at least $100 million in research specifically focused on Parkinson's is allocated. And if it takes stronger language, more oversight, or congressional hearings to guarantee it gets done, then that's what we must do. 
Members of the Senate have expressed their interest in seeing the Udall Act fully funded in fiscal year 1999, and we have taken some positive steps this year to accomplish that goal. But our work is not done. The ultimate goal is not legislative accomplishments. It is not adding more dollars to this account or that one. The ultimate goal is to find a cure for this horrible, debilitating disease so that more people don't have to suffer the way my parents and our family did, or the way Mo Udall and his family does, or the way countless families do every day in this country. By passing the Udall Act we made a promise to put the necessary resources into the skilled hands of researchers dedicated to finding that cure. I intend, as I know my colleagues and those in the Parkinson's community intend, to do everything I can to fulfill that promise.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues and the American people to a new veterans memorial in my home state of Minnesota. I believe this memorial will help us remember and better understand the sacrifices made by Korean War veterans. 
As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I was pleased to participate on a recent hot Sunday afternoon in a dedication ceremony for the Minnesota Korean War Veterans Memorial. 
The ceremony was a fitting tribute to the 94,000 Minnesotans who bravely answered the call of duty nearly half a century ago, serving in a land far from home during the `Forgotten War.' A sea of umbrellas protected many in the crowd from the scorching sun while the talented Minnesota State Band entertained with patriotic tunes. Various speakers recalled the brave service by Korean War veterans. On that September afternoon, we paused to remember and honor Korean War veterans. 
Located in the Court of Honor on the State Capitol grounds in St. Paul, the memorial includes eight polished columns bearing the names of the more than 700 Minnesotans who made the ultimate sacrifice. It includes an eight foot bronze statue of an American soldier searching for his buddies. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the members and supporters of Minnesota Korean War Veterans Chapter One for making this important memorial a reality.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe it is important for girls and young women to raise awareness about their concerns, and to work to shape the beliefs and policies which affect girls' lives throughout the world. This year, the Girl's International Forum, sponsored by an organization in my state, brought together fifteen outstanding girls from thirteen states to Seneca Falls. For three days, they met and drafted the following Girl's Declaration of Sentiments. I want to share their thoughtful ideas with my colleagues now.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me just thank my colleague, Senator Durbin, for his remarks. I think they were important. I hope we can translate what the Senator from Illinois had to say about this bill--not into action tomorrow because this is a conference report, there are no amendments, it is voted up or down--I hope it leads to some important changes in this legislative process. 
I listened to my colleague from Illinois, and there are two points that he made that I want to build on. The first has to do with the way this was done. I really think it is not just a question of the people in the country, whether they be in Illinois, whether they be in Minnesota, whether they be in Idaho, Alaska or any other State. It is not just a question of people in this country saying, `Listen, we want to have campaigns, not auctions; is there a way we can get this big money out of politics?' But we didn't do anything in this Congress. 
It is not just a question of people saying we are one of 43.5 million people with no health insurance, or we are elderly people who are paying a quarter of our budget for prescription drugs, or I am one of too many examples in the country where I was turned down for care that I needed by a kind of bottom-line medicine with insurance companies too much in control; isn't there any protection for me? 
It is not just bad enough we didn't respond to any of that. It is not enough that this Congress did absolutely nothing, in spite of all of the hype and too many of the speeches that were given for children in America. I am convinced that the ultimate indictment of the failure of this Congress to do hardly anything positive for people in our country is the way in which we continue to abandon too many children in the country and devalue the work of too many adults who work with those children. For all the families that said to us, Is there some way that you can make child care more affordable for us; is there some way that we can make sure that when both of us have to work, there is good child care for our children, child care that we can afford? --our response was to do nothing. 
It is not enough, Mr. President, that when it comes to the issue of living-wage jobs--which I think is going to become a bigger and bigger issue. Sometimes I fault my own party for continuing to talk about the number of jobs and the relatively low level of unemployment. But boy, I will tell you, when you add to the equation people who are only working part time because they can't find the full-time jobs, or when you add to the equation people who are working full time, 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week and are still poor in America and still look for a raise for themselves, a decent wage, again, the response of our Congress was to do nothing. 
I don't think that is the real issue that we are faced with here. I want to count myself as someone who is in profound disagreement with a Congress that basically has been a do-nothing Congress. I think that in the last several months out here on the floor, as a Senator who really believes in coming out here with amendments and trying to respond to people and really do something for people, it has been a little frustrating to have a process that is just not open and you are able to do that. I also understand the majority leader and some of what he has had to deal with. 
Now we have a bill before us--I heard my colleague from Illinois say, I think, 25 pounds. I heard it weighs 40 pounds. Somebody will have to weigh it. It is 2 feet tall. That is a third of my height, if you want to believe that. Actually, not quite. I guess I can't get away with that. But it is 2 feet tall, roughly 40 pounds, and we haven't even seen it. 
We have had staff that are now trying to evaluate it. Can you imagine? You have eight appropriations bills put into this piece of what Senator Byrd called `this monstrosity,' weighs close to 40 pounds, 2 feet tall, and we have hardly had a chance to look at it. And we are going to vote on it tomorrow. 
And in all due respect to my colleague from Alaska, I want to be clear about it. At least in the time I have been here--and I am not just trying to make friends because, boy, if Senator Stevens does not agree with you, he is out on the floor and he makes it clear what his position is--he is probably the best there is at getting things done here. It is amazing what he can put together. So I do not think it is a question of my colleague from Alaska. 
But looking at this overall process, it is no wonder that people lose confidence in us. We have to do better. It is just unbelievable. It is not true that process does not matter. If this just looks like a bunch of behind-the-scenes deal making, with very few people kind of deciding what is in and what is out of a bill that is--how many pages?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Four thousand pages. If ordinary citizens--which I mean not in a pejorative way, but in a positive way--have not the faintest clue of what is going on, and those of us supposed to be representing people have not been in a position to know what kind of decisions have been made, then it is no wonder that people say we do not believe in this. 
I tell you, between what has happened with this bill and anonymous holds--which is another feature of this process that I really think we have to confront to take on where somebody can just put a hold on something or an individual judge, or whatever; and it is anonymous; and you never find out who it is--between that and conference committees where even if you pass an amendment in both bodies, the conference committee can take it out or something can be put in, I think we do have to do a lot better in this process. I think that should be at the top of the agenda in the next Congress. 
Mr. President, I think that this bill--and as I speak, I do not even know how I will vote on it. On one hand, it is like Fiddler on the Roof. It is certainly better than a Government shutdown. On the other hand, there are some important provisions in this bill. There are some things that are important that have been done. My colleague from Illinois talked about the strong position the President took and the strong leadership the President took on making sure that there are more teachers and how we can reduce class size in grades K through 3--critically important. 
On the other hand, I do not really know all that is in this bill. I guess that puts you in a position of not necessarily voting--it is hard to vote for or against a bill if you do not really know what is in it. But I will tell you, some things I heard my colleague talk about--special deals for the oil industry, corporate welfare for the oil industry, and gosh knows what else has been put in this piece of legislation--makes me wonder, makes me wonder. 
I say this, I think this bill--25 pounds, 40 pounds, 2 feet tall, several thousand pages--that we have not had a chance to review sort of represents our failure to deal with these appropriations bills, deal with this budget, have an open debate, have an accountable political process. And I think this bill that we are supposed to vote up or down on tomorrow--a conference report--represents the profound failure of this Congress to do well for people in Minnesota and people in the country. I think that is really what it is all about. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to proposed increases in military spending contained in the supplemental appropriations provisions for FY 1999, and to comment on even larger anticipated proposals for increases in the military budget for fiscal year 2000 and beyond that will be the subject of ongoing debate in Washington in the coming months. 
I have always been a strong supporter of our men and women in uniform, and I believe we must provide the best possible training, equipment, and preparation for our military forces, so they can effectively carry out whatever peacekeeping, humanitarian, war-fighting, or other missions they are given. But certain Republican proponents of increased defense spending here in Washington are trying to use an alleged `readiness crisis' to get $1 billion or more additional funding included in the omnibus appropriations bill to be considered before adjournment. And this is just the first step. Some Pentagon officials, and Republican defense hawks here in Congress, are reportedly already pressing the Administration to increase next year's budget request by up to $15 billion, and by an estimated $50-75 billion over the next five years. These numbers are in addition to the grossly wasteful and unnecessary military spending of recent years, much of which was over and above what the Pentagon itself had requested from Congress to complete its mission. 
These large increases are unjustified. Yes, I recognize that to a certain extent there are problems with readiness. There are shortages of spare parts in some areas, for example. It is reportedly difficult to retain pilots and other key personnel; certain of our armed forces, especially enlisted personnel, are suffering a declining quality of life. But if we look carefully at the military budget we can see that these readiness problems are not caused by inadequate military budgets, but rather by a wasteful and irresponsible, often politically-motivated misallocation of existing defense dollars to military programs and projects in states of key members of Congress. This is the crux of the matter. There is more than sufficient funding in the current budget to fix these problems if priorities are reassessed and money is redirected from wasteful and obsolete weapons programs to crucial readiness measures. 
We continue to pour billions into Cold War era weapons programs that are essentially massive pork projects for the states and districts of various members of Congress. Congress has also contributed to the readiness problems by refusing to close military bases which the Pentagon acknowledges are unneeded and obsolete, and has pressed to have closed. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and his colleagues on the Joint Staff, testified to this recently before the Armed Services Committee--they effectively said if you want us to fix these problems, then stop ramming down our throats weapons systems, ships and planes that we don't need, don't want, and haven't requested--and start closing down antiquated or outdated military bases that we can no longer afford to maintain, for which there is no reasonable purpose. 
Mr. President, as I've said, I believe in maintaining a strong national defense. We face a number of credible threats in the world today, including terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. But let's make sure we carefully identify the threats we face and tailor our defense spending to meet them. Let's not continue to maintain military spending based on the needs of the Cold War. 
Mr. President, we do not need to spend more on the military. We only need to spend what we have already allocated more intelligently and more honestly. We do not need to give more money to an already bloated Pentagon for wasteful pork projects when we have so many urgent problems in this country that need attention. We need to focus on adequate funding for the hundreds of domestic programs that protect the vulnerable; protect our lakes and streams; provide health care for the vulnerable elderly; and create expanded opportunities for the broad middle class, such as student loans and job retraining. 
The real `readiness' crisis, Mr. President, is not in the military budget but in the readiness of the Congress to give up its attachment to wasteful pork projects, and in the readiness of Pentagon officials to make the hard choices about what programs are really necessary for the restructured military force we need to face the challenges of the 21st century. I expect that an omnibus bill will pass, and that some additional defense spending will be included in it for Bosnia and other needs. But I hope my colleagues will keep these concerns in mind as the defense spending debate moves forward next year. 
I intend to press forward my efforts here in the Senate to make sure we more responsibly balance our defense and domestic priorities, by scaling back wasteful defense spending, and reallocating existing military funds to address our readiness problems, so that we can invest more in the skills and intellect and character of our children; in basic health care for all; in decent education, affordable housing and jobs that can sustain families.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an important provision of the FY1999 VA/HUD appropriations bill. Thanks to the hard work and grassroots efforts of tenants and housing advocates across the country, this VA/HUD bill includes a 5 month minimum requirement to notify tenants and communities of an owner's intent to repay his or her federally assisted mortgage. 
This provision helps tenants of Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) housing as created by the National Housing Act for federally assisted, privately owned affordable housing. Under the Section 221 program, the federal government insures the mortgages on certain rental housing; under the Section 236 program, the federal government subsidizes the interest payments that owners of rental housing made on the mortgages. Both of these programs offer the security of a federal subsidy for building owners in return for their maintaining these buildings as affordable housing. Regulatory agreements signed between HUD and the building owners restrict the rents which could be charged on the units within the building so long as the mortgage is insured or subsidized by HUD. To be eligible, an owner signs a 40 year mortgage; however, the owner can prepay the mortgage or end the contract after 20 years and has the ability to remove that building from the pool of affordable housing. 
Twenty years have now passed, and the legislative housing initiatives of the 1980s have failed to curb the collapse of this once sturdy guarantee of affordable housing for low-income families and individuals. One major provision is that owners of a Section 236 project simply need to give their tenants a 30-60 day notice that the property is under the prepayment process. All too often the prepayment of the mortgage by the owners results in a tremendous loss to the tenants of that project. Without the federally backed restriction on rents that can be charged, the prepayment of the mortgage opens the door to new owners who on average have increased the tenants monthly rent by 49%. 
This increase in rent forces low-income tenants out of their homes. This increase in rent forces these tenants to search for new housing, often in rental markets with exceptionally low vacancy rates. At the same time the supply of low-income housing takes a big hit, fewer and fewer units are available with each prepayment of Section 236 housing for the low-income families in desperate need of adequate housing. 
Mr. President, the Senate version of the VA/HUD bill included a provision to give tenants of Section 236 housing a fair notice--one full year--of the owner's intent to prepay the mortgage on the building. This critical one year notice was designed to accomplish two goals. First, it would have given the tenants a notice of the owner's prepayment intentions. For some tenants, especially those living in the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropolitan area, finding housing has been extremely difficult. The vacancy rate is at 1.9%. It was simply unreasonably to expect those tenants to find alternative housing within only 30 days with such a low vacancy rate. In fact, it has been nearly impossible for low-income tenants and families to find adequate housing in such a short time in such a tight housing market. Secondly, the one year notice would have given a community the critical time necessary to begin to formulate options to keep that building available for those in need of affordable housing. I am pleased that the Senate is on record supporting the need for a fair notice to tenants. 
Unfortunately, the conference report does not include the full extent of my provision. The one-year notice period was reduced in the VA/HUD Conference Committee. It was reduced to not shorter than five months, but not longer than a nine months notice by owners. In addition, the provision now includes an enactment date effective 150 days after passage of the bill. Clearly, I am not enthusiastic about this revision to the notice requirement, but it is certainly an improvement over the current requirement of 30-60 days. As a result, the shorter time may only buy additional time for the families facing the increase in rent and their eventual move to alternative housing. I fear that the 5-9 months will not accord non-profits and communities with the necessary time to purchase the building and maintain those units as affordable housing. 
However, this revised provision does put the right foot forward. Not only is it a public acknowledgment that Congress sees the prepayment of Section 236 and Section 231 housing as a potential crisis facing the market, it gives tenants and communities the framework to find affordable alternatives for low-income families. This is only the first step. To truly restore fairness to the housing situation, tenants should have a longer period of time--one year or longer advance notice. The Senate is on record in support of a one-year notice and the next Congress should move to increase the notice period again. I am proud of the work that has been done, but I believe we have to do more. 
I thank my colleagues for supporting this important provision. While the revisions in the conference report may be the best possible solution to the crisis facing the tens of thousands of families dealing with the prepayment of their building, it does provide a necessary improvement to existing law.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner for speaking about Kosovo. I am disappointed that the Senate has not brought a resolution to the floor and had a debate about what our response should be as a Nation to what is happening in Kosovo. I think it is a profound mistake on our part not to have this discussion given the fact that we are going to adjourn within the next couple of days. 
Mr. President, I want to be held accountable. I think we should all be held accountable as to what our viewpoints are and what we think our country should or should not do. 
Mr. President, while there have been some indications in recent days that the slaughter of innocent civilians has slowed--at least temporarily--we cannot afford to turn our attention away from the situation there. 
President Milosevic claims to have ordered some units of his army back to their barracks, but it is too early to tell exactly what these actions mean and whether Milosevic actually intends to cease his brutal offensive against the Albanian Kosovars. There is considerable evidence that he may not be truly pulling back in accordance with Western demands, but rather taking halfway measures that would allow his troops and tanks to return to the fighting almost immediately. UN Secretary General Annan reported earlier this week that there is still a significant presence of Serb armed forces in Kosovo, and that some special police units are continuing punitive operations against the local population. I remain deeply skeptical about Milosevic's intentions. 
We have had too much experience with Milosevic to take his statements at face value and to assume that the killing has really ended. We have seen his defiance of world opinion and international law for years. Recently we were all shocked by the horrific massacres of civilians--the massacre of women, elderly men, even young children and infants. These killings, attributed to Serb security forces, are an affront to the international community. 
Now it looks as if Milosevic may have ordered a partial withdrawal of his attack forces, hoping to avoid imminent military action by NATO. He may believe that if the killings stop for a time, the attention of NATO and the U.S. will turn elsewhere. We must not allow that to happen. We must keep our focus on the crisis in Kosovo, and not become distracted by other issues. 
Unless immediate action is taken to forestall a humanitarian tragedy, we may soon see even more disturbing and gruesome pictures from Kosovo. With an estimated 150,000 people in Kosovo living out in the open without any shelter and with winter approaching, international relief agencies now fear that tens of thousands of those displaced persons could face severe hardship and some even death from exposure unless they can return to their homes or be provided adequate shelter within the next couple of weeks. 
The situation on the ground in Kosovo is heartbreaking. According to a report from a representative of the International Rescue Committee who recently visited the Kosovo countryside, young children are wandering around in the hills barefoot or in ripped sandals. Extended families of several generations are sleeping 15 to 20 to a tent. The tents are clear plastic supported only by bent saplings. Mothers are desperate to return home. Even if their houses are burned they would rather sleep in tents in their own yards then in the inhospitable hills. But they are afraid to return home, because every time they try to return snipers shoot at them. 
As the IRC report relates, these displaced Kosovars are trying to survive in areas where there is no food, no shelter, no schools for the children, no latrine system, and no other basic infrastructure. They have only the clothes they were wearing when they fled in the summer. The children have diarrhea from the dirty water and lack of sanitation. Parents watch, worried, as their children vomit all night and become dehydrated. Soon they will also have to face snow and freezing cold. 
These appalling conditions cannot continue. We must get aid to this terrorized population swiftly. But we can only get relief to them if Milosevic ceases his repression and allows relief agencies unfettered access. 
The Administration and our NATO allies must keep the pressure on Milosevic to put an end to Serb military action in Kosovo and to comply with the demands of the UN Security Council resolution of September 23. That resolution demands that both parties cease hostilities and maintain a cease-fire. The resolution also calls on Belgrade to (1) cease all action by the security forces affecting the civilian population and order the withdrawal of security forces used for civilian repression; (2) allow free access for international diplomatic monitors in Kosovo and unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations and supplies to Kosovo and; (3) make rapid progress on a clear timetable in conducting autonomy talks with the Kosovo Albanian community. 
I have also been encouraged that NATO has instructed its military commanders to begin preparations for possible military action and that NATO members have informed NATO Command what forces and equipment they are prepared to supply for actions in the Kosovo region. 
I have always been a Senator who insists that military actions abroad should always be a last resort. I still hope and pray, as a Senator from Minnesota, that in this situation we will not have to resort to force. I view it as a last option if we cannot resolve this situation by diplomatic means. But I also recognize that we cannot rule out the use of force, including the use of air strikes, in this situation. If the killing resumes or if Milosevic prevents relief from getting to the displaced Kosovars and fails to comply with the UN resolution and the demands of the international community, we may have to resort to military action. 
I met with Milosevic once. I wanted to see firsthand the genocide of several years ago. He was the first and only person I have met that I would not shake hands with. I don't think he can be believed, and I think that we have to send him a forceful message. 
To prepare for possible implementation of more forceful options developed by NATO planners, we should continue to move forward now, under NATO auspices, with pre-deployment in the region of appropriate levels of NATO military equipment and forces. This would include such actions as pre-positioning aircraft and naval vessels, and deployment of necessary materiel to support NATO troops. 
These moves would be intended to send another clear message to Milosevic that he must comply with the UN Security Council Resolution immediately. If he does not respond we must be ready to take further steps to force compliance as necessary. 
At the same time, we need to take other actions to keep the pressure on Milosevic. The U.S. should press forward on an intensified multilateral effort, at the United Nations and through regional bodies like the European Union, to firmly tighten the existing sanctions regime on Serbia, to re-impose other sanctions lifted after signing of the Dayton Peace Accord, and to otherwise increase pressure on Milosevic to comply. 
We must also accelerate U.S. and NATO logistical support for the ongoing international humanitarian aid effort in Kosovo, including pre-deployment of humanitarian supplies in Kosovo in anticipation of winter distribution by non-governmental organizations, while ensuring the safety and security of those who will rely on such aid. 
There must be no repeat of the disgraceful Bosnian `safe haven' disaster of Srebrenica.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Carl Youngblom, a great American from my state, who unexpectedly passed away earlier this year. 
Carl proudly served his nation as a Korean War veteran. He proudly served his community as former president of the St. Peter Rotary International. And he proudly served disabled veterans as a past Minnesota Department Commander of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV). 
In fact, I got to know Carl after he was elected DAV Department Commander in 1995. I can tell you from personal experience that he was a staunch advocate for disabled veterans and their families, often urging us in Congress to do well for our veterans, and I deeply respected him for that. According to his wife Val, he became such a strong veterans advocate out of love for his older brother, whose life was changed from being wounded in combat during World War II. 
Carl also had a strong connection to agriculture, starting as a family farmer and then moving to a career in agriculture finance. He was a fine athlete who loved to swim, cross country ski, and run. But perhaps most impressive was how his kindness touched people and how his compassion helped build consensus during times of conflict. We will miss him dearly. 
Mr. President, I conclude by asking my colleagues to join me in expressing to his loving wife Val and their children and grandchildren our nation's eternal gratitude for Carl Youngblom's significant and myriad contributions.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I'm introducing a bill that would bar firms owned by China's People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police from operating in the United States and prohibit the import into the United States of products made by these firms or the export of products to these firms. It would also prohibit extension of credit to or ownership interest in Chinese military companies. The bill contains an exemption for humanitarian aid, waiving these prohibitions if the President determines that a transaction involves items intended to relieve human suffering such as food, medicine or emergency supplies. 
My bill is based in part on H.R. 4433 introduced in the House on August 6, 1998 by Representatives Gephardt, Bonior, and Pelosi, who I want to commend for taking this bold and important human rights initiative. 
Before I get into the key question of why I'm introducing this bill, I would like to touch on the question of the extent of PLA and People's Armed Police commercial relations with the United States. To begin with, I should stress that there is uncertainty about the extent and nature of activities of companies linked to Chinese military and security forces in the United States. For example, a Rand study last year estimated that there are `between 20-30 PLA-affiliated companies operating in the United States, although there are certainly more that have not yet been identified.' It added that one of the major obstacles to identifying these companies is that they `often consciously disguise their military background by using offshore holding companies and unfamiliar names.' 
Nevertheless, while there is much we don't know, there is some hard data available on PLA and People's Armed Police business dealings with the United States. In June, 1997 the AFL-CIO's Food and Allied Services Trades Department issued a report providing a wealth of detailed information on these business dealings. The report, based on extensive research, found twelve companies incorporated in the United States owned by the People's Armed Police and various elements of the PLA, including the General Staff Department and the Navy. In addition, the report cited seven PLA companies that had been dissolved after their officials had been accused of smuggling AK-47's into the United States in 1996--an episode I will discuss later. For each company, the report provided addresses and dates of incorporation, and for some companies the names of registered agents, officers, and directors. 
The AFL-CIO report also provided detailed data on the exports to the United States of twenty-five People's Armed Police and PLA companies during 1996. The companies included not only major PLA components such as the General Staff and General Logistics Departments, but also some owned by various PLA military regions. All told, these companies exported 34 million pounds of products to the United States, including furniture, chemicals, rain gear, toys, sport rifles, aircraft engines, and fish. According to an AFL-CIO official, PLA companies were the largest exporters of fish for U.S. fast-food restaurants. Finally, the report contained a listing of U.S. companies that had purchased these products. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last November, an AFL-CIO official pointed out that several well-known U.S. concerns had purchased products directly from PLA companies. 
While it is not illegal for the People's Armed Police and PLA companies to operate in the United States, on at least one occasion a major PLA company participated in a clearly illegal activity. In May, 1996, federal law enforcement agencies carried out a sting operation connected with seizure of 2,000 fully automatic AK-47 weapons from China. Since 1994 Chinese gun exports to the United States have been illegal and this was the largest seizure of fully automatic weapons in U.S. history. One of the two Chinese companies involved, Poly Technologies, is the most successful PLA-controlled company. Poly is run by China's princelings, family members of top Chinese civilian and military leaders. Poly's president is the late Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law and a retired PLA Major General. The Chairman of Poly is the son of the late Wang Zhen, who was China's vice-president and a retired General. While China experts doubt there was high-level collusion in the smuggling of AK-47's, a federal law enforcement officer noted that those involved were `in a position to deliver substantial arms and are not low-level flunkies.' 
Mr. President, I now want to turn to the key question of why I decided to introduce this bill. Why is there a need for such legislation? Because companies owned by the PLA--the Chinese Government's main and indispensable instrument of repression--are permitted to operate in the United States. Because the American people are unwittingly purchasing products exported to the United States by companies owned by the PLA and the People's Armed Police. Because the American people would be outraged--as deeply outraged as I am--if they knew they were subsidizing those responsible for massacring students, workers, and other demonstrators for democracy in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, those who have occupied Tibet for almost 50 years, brutally oppressing its people and seeking to erase their unique, cultural, linguistic, and religious heritage. And because they would be outraged--as deeply outraged as I am, that their government is not only doing nothing to stop this, but is opposing efforts to end PLA and People's Armed Police profit-making in the United States. 
Mr. President, you may well ask what is the People's Armed Police. The People's Armed Police, who are under the operational control of the PLA, are an internal security force of over 1 million troops, one of whose main purposes is to suppress the legitimate protests of the Chinese people. For example, the People's Armed Police is often used to quash the peaceful protests of Chinese workers. 
Last year the People's Armed Police was used to brutally break up protests by thousands of laid-off state enterprise workers in Sichuan province. Hundreds of these workers, who took to the streets because company officials embezzled their unemployment compensation, were reportedly beaten by the People's Armed Police and several `instigators' were arrested. Chinese officials were said to have ordered hospitals not to treat wounded demonstrators, comparing them to `counterrevolutionary thugs' who `rioted' at Tiananmen in June 1989. What were the laid-off workers seeking that provoked such a vicious crackdown by the People's Armed Police? Just that the government provide them with the subsistence they are entitled to and that corrupt company officials be punished. 
How can we continue to subsidize the thugs who repress Chinese workers? 
The People's Armed Police also man the guard towers of the Laogai, China's massive forced labor camp system--the largest in the world. The Laogai is China's version of the Soviet gulag. The Laogai is comprised of more than 1,100 forced labor camps, with an estimated population of 6 to 8 million prisoners. Prisoners are overworked, denied medical treatment and tortured. 
How can we continue to subsidize those who guard slave laborers? 
The People's Armed Police and the PLA are the key agents of repression in Tibet. The People's Armed Police have been filmed in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, beating monks and nuns peacefully demonstrating for their rights. This past May, the People's Armed Police and PLA soldiers reportedly fired on 150 Tibetan political prisoners who staged a demonstration in Tibet's main prison and the police later stormed the prison and arrested the demonstrators. Chinese officials were apparently offended when the political prisoners flew a Tibetan national flag during the demonstration. 
How can we continue to subsidize those who deny Tibetans fundamental freedoms, beat and torture them, and seek to destroy their unique culture and religion? 
Mr. President, this is shameful and it must be stopped. Would we have allowed Stalin's NKVD or Hitler's SS to subsidize their heinous activities by running profit-making entities in the United States and exporting goods to us and buying goods from us? Of course not. Why then do we allow the likes of the PLA and the People's Armed Police to profit from commercial relations with us and why does the Administration oppose efforts to put an end to this? 
Mr. President, the Administration in the past has justified the unjustifiable by arguing that imposing sanctions on PLA and People's Armed Police companies would be an `impossible task' for U.S. law enforcement agencies, risk retaliation against major U.S. exporters, and harm our efforts to develop a military-to-military dialog and relationship with China. 
While I believe these arguments don't hold water, they have been overtaken by events. In July, President Jiang Zemin ordered the PLA and the People's Armed Police to end the `commercial activities' of their subordinate units. There are some questions about the extent to which Jiang's orders will be carried out and over what time-frame. Tai Ming Cheung, a noted expert on China's military, foresees some shrinkage of the military-business complex, but predicts that it will `remain powerful and more focused.' Some China experts estimate that as much as one-third of total defense spending derive from profits from PLA businesses and it would obviously be difficult for the government to compensate the military for loss of this funding stream. 
Be this as it may, the fact remains that it is now Chinese government policy to end the commercial activities of the PLA and the People's Armed Police. I believe that the Senate should do all we can to help Beijing by passing my bill, which seeks to cut U.S. commercial ties with the PLA and the People's Armed Police and to end their business activities in the United States. Since we would be cooperating with Jiang's policies, the Administration can no longer point to alleged harmful effects on our military-to-military dialog or Chinese retaliation against U.S. exporters. Moreover, we would have reason to expect that the ability of U.S. law enforcement agencies to implement the sanctions contained in this bill would be enhanced since PLA and People's Armed Police business activities would be illegal both in China and the United States. Jiang Zemin presumably would have incentives to end or at least circumscribe Chinese military and police business dealings with and in the United States and, perhaps, even cooperate with U.S. law enforcement agencies. 
While no one can predict how successful Jiang will be in eliminating or even in cutting back China's military-business complex, we must act to end U.S. subsidies to those who beat, torture, and imprison those who bravely fight for freedom and democracy. By contributing to PLA and People's Armed Police coffers we act in complicity with those who repress workers, run slave labor camps, crush religious freedom, quash Tibetans and other minorities seeking to preserve their identity culture and religion. We betray those who laid down their lives at Tiananmen Square, inspired by American principles of democracy and individual rights and we betray those brave dissidents who rot in Chinese jails or toil in forced labor camps, whose only crime was to fight for the ideals all Americans hold dear. It is time to end this complicity, end these betrayals of our friends. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. 
Mr. President, I had a chance to speak yesterday and I don't want to really repeat the arguments I made yesterday. I do not intend to vote for this bill today, but I think that by the end of the week, or at least I am hopeful, we will be able to resolve our differences and pass a farm relief bill that will do the job--or at least will be a huge help for family farmers in Minnesota and across the country. 
Mr. President, the President of the United States indicated on Saturday that the farm relief bill--this bill that we are looking at right now, which we will be voting on--is inadequate. He has said that more will need to be done with farm relief. It will have to be improved before he can sign an Agriculture appropriations bill. I am hopeful that either following the veto of this bill, or as part of the negotiations --and I think I have a different view from my colleague from Idaho, I am not sure--as part of the negotiations on the emergency supplemental packages, which may be included in an omnibus appropriations bill, we will see an improved version of this farm relief package. 
I said yesterday to my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, I much appreciate the work he has done. We have come a significant way from where we were. This is a $4 billion relief package. I think that given the position the President has taken --and as a Senator from Minnesota, I have certainly requested that he take this position; I have said I hope he will veto this bill or wait until we get some kind of relief package that I think would do a better job. I have to continue to fight as long and as hard as I can for family farmers in my State, for what I think will be most helpful to them. Frankly, I believe that given the Senators who are dealing with this question on both sides of the aisle--we all care fiercely about agriculture, and I think we have an understanding about it--I don't see any reason why, by the end of this week, given the position the President has taken, we can't have some really strenuous, but I think substantive, negotiations and come up with a much better relief package. 
Now, this relief package that my colleague, Senator Cochran, brings to the floor of the Senate is a credible effort. But I think it is insufficient. There is an inadequate amount of money, and I think it utilizes the wrong mechanism to deliver the assistance that is meant to address the price crisis. Let me just be clear about what is at issue here. Surely, given the position the President is taking, which is the position that the Senator from Minnesota and many other Midwestern Senators asked him to take, which is to make it clear that he will veto this bill unless there are negotiations and we can get a better package. 
Why have we taken this position? Well, our proposal, $7 billion-plus, and the proposal we have before us on the floor of the Senate are similar in that both include between $2 billion and $2.5 billion for indemnity assistance for crop loss. This is an increase from the original $500 million, which many of us worked very hard to include in the original Senate bill. It is not surprising. There are a whole lot of people who have really been hit hard and who need the help. 
The Republican package, however, that is before us also contains an additional $1.7 billion. So there is agreement on the indemnity part. We went from $500 million to $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The Republican package also contains about $1.7 billion to address the price crisis. The way they deliver this assistance is through a supplemental or bonus transition payment, and that is where there is a big disagreement. The prices for our major commodities, such as wheat, corn and soybeans, are 15 to 30 percent below the 5-year market average. Our $5 billion proposal to address the price crisis--where there is the difference here--would lift the current caps on the loan rate and raise those loan rates about 57 cents a bushel for wheat, about 28 cents a bushel for corn, and over 20 cents a bushel for soybeans. This would not only immediately boost farm income for the farmers of these commodities, but in raising the loan rate, it also has a beneficial effect on market prices. It tends to lift them up. That is why I think our proposal is superior. 
Mr. President, I worry about these transition payments because I think there are a couple of problems with them. First of all, these payments are based on the old farm program's historic yields. Farmers such as traditional soybean farmers, who never had a program based on the old program, don't get any of these AMTA payments. That is one huge problem. On the other hand, it is possible for some people who might not even have planted a crop to receive them because the Freedom to Farm--or what I call the `Freedom to Fail'--payments are completely unconnected to production or price. 
I have to tell you, that is the key issue. That is the key difference. At the very minimum, in dealing with the price crisis, we ought to make sure that the payments are connected to production and price. So what we have here in this bill is the wrong mechanism for addressing the price crisis. Our proposal would lift the cap on the loan rates. I think there can be negotiation. The President is correct in vetoing this bill if that is what is required to get better assistance. Thousands of family farmers across the country could go out of business due to conditions that are beyond their control. In Minnesota, up to 20 percent of our family farmers are threatened. Now, the other part of this is that the Democratic proposal for the State of Minnesota is worth about an additional one-quarter of a billion dollars. 
I ask the Chair, has 20 minutes expired?

Mr. WELLSTONE. The proposal is worth an additional one-quarter of a billion dollars for agriculture in Minnesota, for rural Minnesota, for what we call `greater Minnesota.' It is no small amount of money, especially when you consider the multiplier effect in our communities. 
So I say to my colleague, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, this is a start. I am going to vote against this. The President has said he is going to veto it unless there is further negotiation. I think we can do better. I don't like the rider that basically continues another 6 months with the dairy compact. 
I have dairy farmers in my State who are going under because of very unfair pricing mechanisms. 
In addition, I emphasis again, we are in agreement when it comes to crop losses, disaster, people who didn't have the insurance because of wet weather, scab disease or whatever. We are not in agreement on the price. 
There are two problems. The main one is at the very minimum you have to target the price, whatever you do by way of dealing with low prices. You have to make sure that the payments are connected to the production of the price. Too many of these transition payments go to landowners, and not necessarily producers. I don't think that makes a lot of sense. Some, like soybean growers, won't be helped at all. 
I think we can do better on the price part. I think we have to do better if this relief package is going to do the job. I think we have some differences out here. They are honestly held differences. All of us care about agriculture. All of us know what the economic and personal pain is out there in the countryside. 
Some are quite often critical of some of the President's policies, but I thank him for exerting strong leadership on this question and for making it clear that surely this week in negotiations we can do better. We can come up with an even better package. 
My colleague from Mississippi brings a package out here that is an important start. We are going to get the job done by the end of the week or by next week. We are going to get the job done. We are going to have a relief package, because we have to, because that is why we are here. I believe we can do that through the negotiations that are to come.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, first of all, I would like to start out thanking my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. Above and beyond his ability as Senator, I think probably the best thing about him is his civility, and I wish I wasn't in profound disagreement with my colleague, but I am. I do wish to thank him for some of the good things in this bill. In this appropriations bill, we are talking about farm programs; we are talking about nutrition programs, forestry, and also there is a great deal of research money. In particular, I am very pleased that we are going to see additional funding for research of the scab disease which is a terribly important problem for my State and certainly for North Dakota as well. The faculty at the University of Minnesota is doing some very important research in this area. 
Madam President, I talked to our FSA director, Wally Sparby, and he sent me some information that I might just start out with. Mr. Sheldon Erickson from Roseau, MN at Border State Bank is talking about the situation of bankers: 90 percent of his farmers can't repay in 1998; 25 percent he won't be able to lend to in 1999; he says more equity lending is required but less is available. Percy Blake of Bremer Bank in Crookston, MN: 75 percent of borrowers won't be able to meet their obligations in 1998; 50 percent are in jeopardy of not being financed in the coming year; he says that regulators are trying to pressure them away from equity financing. 
We have a plea and cry from not just family farmers in our communities, but from the lenders and small businesses and from the citizens, I say to my colleague from Mississippi. 
I have here petitions from all over the State of Minnesota. People who signed these petitions did this with some hope. It says: 
We, the people of rural Minnesota, exercising our constitutional right to petition the Government for redress of grievances, hereby state and declare: That the exceptionally low prices being paid for farm commodities in the State of Minnesota constitute a dire threat, a crisis imperiling residents, businesses and institutions of rural communities who are demanding an immediate response from our Federal Government; that without action by the Secretary of Agriculture to increase the support prices for corn, soybeans, wheat, small grains, hogs, cattle and dairy products and to extend loans and increase loan rates and to make crop insurance coverage effective, thousands of families relying on farming and rural businesses will lose their livelihoods; that the 1996 Federal farm bill must be revised this year in order to restore an economic safety net for family farmers and allow them to support rural small businesses and community institutions; that these destructive policies must be reversed to ensure healthy main streets, full schools and full churches in rural communities of the State of Minnesota. 
I say to the Chair, I don't know how many signatures there are here, but this is just a sample of the people. Let me show you those who have signed their names to this with the hope that it will make a difference. 
Madam Chair, the differences between this bill's $4 billion package and the $7 billion package that we proposed are ones that make a difference. 
Part of it has to do with the amount of assistance, but the big issue is the price crisis. I am actually not going to speak that long on the floor of the Senate because my colleagues, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska and Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, have already spoken about this. In many ways what we are struggling with is not just the wet weather and not just the scab disease, but disastrously low prices. It is hard to believe that we really want to have such a low cap as that in the Freedom to Farm bill--I call it the `Freedom to Fail' bill--at a time when prices are so low. 
In our proposal we talked about taking the current cap off the loan rate. As I hear from people in our communities--not just the farmers but the lenders as well--this is the most direct and dramatic way that we can get some income to these families. We would raise the loan rate about 57 cents a bushel for wheat, about 27 cents a bushel for corn, and over 20 cents a bushel for soybeans. That would be what would happen if we would lift the cap. 
What was not anticipated--I think my colleague from Mississippi would agree with me on this point--when the Freedom to Farm bill, or `Freedom to Fail' bill, was passed, was that the prices would plummet. I do not think Senators realized that, although I think farmers have always known that prices go up and down. What happened is we basically eliminated the leverage the farmers have in the marketplace --where the loan rate helps them in their dealing with grain companies. In addition there was a safety net that was extremely important. At least it provided some direct assistance to people. We have eliminated that. 
I say to my colleagues today, I appreciate their work, but this relief package will not do the job. It is impossible for me as a Senator to come out here and speak for it or to vote for it. It is very important that the President veto this. The President said he will. It is important that we get back to negotiations and work out a package together. It has to be a bipartisan package. 
Just in terms of corn growers who currently are receiving $1.50 a bushel for corn or less, they cannot cash flow on that. The same is going on with our wheat farmers--low prices. 
I think surely we will hear from Senator Feingold from Wisconsin. Senator Kohl actually has just come out on the floor. Our dairy farmers in the upper Midwest have been going under. We have a federal milk marketing order system that is absolutely discriminatory, and there is a legislative rider in this appropriations bill which effectively extends that discrimination another half a year. That is completely unsatisfactory, at the very time the Secretary of Agriculture has put a process into effect to examine and reform this system. That reform process is not enough for many of us, but we appreciate it as a positive step, moving forward. Now that reform process will be postponed for an additional 6 months under the provision of this legislative rider, which in addition has the effect of extending for 6 months the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, another policy which has a discriminatory effect upon dairy producers and the dairy industry of the upper Midwest. 
So, as a Senator from Minnesota, I cannot in good conscience support an appropriations bill that will not provide the needed assistance to family farmers in rural communities in my State. It would amount to betrayal. People are in desperate shape. That is the `why' of all these petitions. That is the `why' of all the meetings I have attended: in Crookston, East Grand Forks, Granite Falls, Fulda, Worthington. That is the `why' of grown men and women crying because they are being driven off their farms. They work there, they live there, it is everything that they have ever worked for. 
Nobody can say we are talking about a group of citizens who do not work hard, but this just seems beyond their control. Now we have an appropriations bill that does not deal with the price crisis, that does not get enough relief out there, that is not going to enable these people to stay on the farms. It does not do the job. 
I think family farmers in rural America know that. We have to do better. Senator Cochran has done all that he can do. I think he has pushed hard for what he thinks is right. But some of the rest of us have to come out here and we have to fight hard for what we think is right. The President has to stay strong, and he has said he will veto this bill. We need to go back to the table and put negotiations on a fast-track to get a farm crisis relief package that will do the job. 
For my State, the differences between the two packages amount to a quarter of a billion dollars. That is $250 million more for family farmers and small businesses in rural communities. This is a decisive moment for the State of Minnesota, for agriculture and for family farmers. 
In many parts of our country we hardly have a family farm structure of agriculture any longer, where the people who live on the land make the investments and work on the land. In the Midwest I think we understand a very sound economic point, which is also, I think, a social message: the health and vitality of our communities are not based upon the number of acres that are farmed or the number of animals that are owned. Somebody will always farm that land or own that land. The question is, Are we going to have family farmers? The health and vitality of our communities are based upon the number of farmers--I say to the Senator from Wisconsin--the number of family dairy farmers. 
We have a crisis, and that crisis deserves a strong and effective response from the U.S. Congress. This appropriations bill--and I say this not in a shrill way but in a very determined way--is not an adequate response to that crisis. 
Therefore, I will vote against it. I call on the President to veto it. And I call on my colleagues please to work together and do better. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak today to recognize Andy Williams, an individual who along with only seven others in the nation, has received the National Crime Prevention Council's Ameritech, Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. 
Andy, while employed as a cab driver, made a decision in 1989 that inner-city youth needed both good role models and more chances to learn. He has since devoted his time, energy, and limited resources to the city of St. Paul's young people. Youth in St. Paul have benefited by the creation of his first program, Worker's Organization to Regain Confidence (WORC). After working a 7 or 8 hour day in his cab, he used it to collect kids from school and take them to miscellaneous jobs he had set up for them, providing an alternative to after-school delinquency and crime. Kids took on various jobs such as cleaning windows for a local business, running a lawn service, delivering dinners, learning how to repair small engines, and shovel snow. These programs usually involved 12 to 14 participants. 
A successful year later, he expanded WORC into a non-profit organization, guiding at-risk youth in the St. Paul communities of Frogtown and Summit-University. WORC and his newly created subsidiary, SOCK (Save Our City Kids), cooperate with other non-profits to provide work skills, peer counseling, and apprenticeship opportunities. These help the students develop self-confidence, self-respect, and more of the skills crucial to becoming self-sufficent. 
Andy has since created several other fruitful programs which continue to benefit the community. His innovations have enabled him and several hundred students to achieve a vision which reflects the nature of the Ameritech Award. His efforts and commitment are a great example for those who wish to make a difference in their own communities. The other programs include: WORC on Bikes, the Drop-In-Center, the Let's Talk program, and Whiz Kids. WORC on Bikes is a program in which youth learn to repair bicycles and eventually earn their own bikes. The Drop-In-Center is a place where any adult or child can stop and discuss personal concerns, such as family problems, alcohol and drug abuse, and violence. The Let's Talk program empowers youth, teenagers, adults, and parents by providing the tools with which solutions to social problems can begin to be addressed. Whiz Kids is a community-based computer education program which makes technology more accessible to youth, while assisting them in developing related skills to prepare them for future endeavors. It is funded entirely through private donations. 
Clearly, Andy was selected for this award for his ability to truly make a difference, to persevere, to work for positive results in the lives of youth in the realm of crime prevention and far beyond. On behalf of the children and families who have profited from his exemplary efforts to better various communities in St. Paul, my thanks for his devoted and lasting contribution to the future of our children, and my congratulations on his well-deserved award.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I support H.R. 3412, the `Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998.' The bill makes useful reforms to existing Small Business Administration (SBA) programs and authorizes certain new initiatives, including a community development venture capital demonstration program which I proposed during markup in the Small Business Committee. I commend Chairman Bond for his leadership on the bill, and I thank him for including my proposal in it. 
The bill makes permanent SBA's 504 liquidation pilot program, a step I strongly support. Minnesota certified development companies with proven liquidation and foreclosure capabilities have made use of the pilot program, which can help bring costs down and save borrowers from higher fees. The bill's adjustments to the loan loss reserve requirements in the Microloan program also are appropriate. Requiring a loss reserve based on past performance makes sense. This provision will continue to protect the government's interest in these loans but will allow the majority of microlenders to make more loans or provide more technical assistance to borrowers. 
I am especially pleased that my proposal to create a new $20-million, four-year demonstration program at the SBA to develop the capacity of community development venture capital (CDVC) organizations is part of H.R. 3412. I thank Senator Bond again for his support and for working with me to get this amendment accepted. I also thank the SBA for working with my staff and for providing valuable technical assistance in drafting the amendment. 
The CDVC Program is about directing venture capital--equity and investment capital--to small businesses with the aim of promoting business growth and economic development in poor communities. That's what we mean by community development venture capital or CDVC. The money the bill authorizes would not be directly invested into small businesses; instead, it would go to provide technical assistance to organizations that invest in businesses in low-income communities. 
CDVC organizations have been highly successful at producing a `double bottom line' of strong financial returns and significant social benefits. CDVC funds create social and financial payoffs because they consider the community impact of their investments to be just as important as the financial returns to investors. Community development venture capitalists target investments to companies that generate good jobs--jobs that pay decent wages, jobs with benefits, jobs with opportunity to advance. They influence and shape the culture of young companies with respect to sustainable development and environmental policies. They look to create local entrepreneurial capacity, local ownership, local wealth. The `double bottom line' philosophy is what makes these venture capitalists so unique and their work so promising. The goal of the CDVC program is to expand and multiply this very meritorious work. 
There are about 30 CDVC funds currently operating in urban and rural communities around the country. Northeast Ventures Corporation in Duluth, Minnesota, is a good example of a successful and experienced CDVC company. Northeast Ventures serves a seven county rural area and focuses on creating good jobs in high value-added industries. Northeast Ventures targets 50% of the jobs created through its investments to women, low-income and structurally unemployed persons. They also require portfolio companies to offer employees an opportunity to participate in a health care plan in which the employer makes some contribution. Partridge River is an example of one of Northeast Ventures successful investments. Northeast made an initial investment in Partridge River, a locally owned specialized manufacturer of precision and wood component parts for furniture and cabinets, in late 1990. Partridge River uses readily available light-colored woods such as aspen, basswood, birch and maples, and has manufacturing customers throughout the United States. When the company needed significant financing for an upgrade of equipment in 1994, another investor purchased Northeast's stake at a significant premium and allowed the entrepreneur to maintain majority ownership. Over the course of Northeast's involvement, the company added 17 net new employees from northeast Minnesota. 
Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation (KHIC), founded in 1968 in London, Kentucky, is one of the oldest and most successful of the CDVC organizations. They focus on developing profitable businesses that provide job opportunities to residents of Southeast Kentucky. For example, KHIC provided over $600,000 in equity financing to a startup company that manufactures casements for the retail store industry. That company now employs over 125 people who had few prospects for employment in their home county. This company would not be located in rural Clay County if not for the type of equity investment that KHIC made available. Altogether, KHIC has infused about $40 million in venture capital in their region, invested in more than 100 companies and created over 5,200 jobs. 
The organizations operating CDVC funds have been fortunate in attracting talented and dedicated people, but the skills and expertise to produce a double bottom line are still relatively scarce. The CDVC Demonstration Program allows the most experienced and successful in this growing field to teach, advise, and mentor the less experienced, the new and emerging community development venture capitalists. 
The CDVC Demonstration Program authorizes $20 million over four years. Seventy-five percent or $15 million will be used as grants to intermediary organizations--the private, nonprofit organizations with the most experience and skill in making venture capital investments in poor communities--to provide hands-on technical assistance to the new and emerging venture funds springing up in low-income communities around the country. In addition to providing technical assistance, intermediaries will be able to use the grants to fund the start up and operating costs of new CDVC organizations. Grants to intermediaries will be matched $1 for $1 with funds raised from non-Federal sources. Twenty-five percent or $5 million will be used as grants to developmental organizations--public or private firms--to create and operate training programs, intern programs, a national conference, and academic research and study of community development venture capital. 
I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will support these reforms and new initiatives in the name of good jobs, entrepreneurship and responsibility to community.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I yield 5 minutes to Senator Murray, serving on the same committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I thank Senator Collins for all the work she put into this piece of legislation. She clearly not only has a higher education background but she is very committed to education. It is wonderful to see Senators who have her commitment, and I thank her for her work.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington. I also echo what I said. There are some Senators here who have really dug into the committee. The same could be said for the Chair, who is on the Labor and Human Resources Committee. I think this is a bipartisan effort. I love Senator Murray's passion for children and education. I say to the Senator from Washington, I think probably more people and more families in Washington, Minnesota, Wyoming, and the country are more focused on education right now than any other issue. The Senator has been a real leader in the area, and I thank her.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to thank colleagues on both sides. Senator Jeffords has done a great job in our committee. I feel a little awkward because there is a lot in this higher education bill that I worked on myself and with other colleagues in the committee. I think this is a good piece of legislation. 
I was pleased to vote for it. I am very pleased with the bill's distance education provisions, which I worked on a great deal. I think the Chair also is very interested in these issues, and we worked together on this portion of the bill. Distance education is very important for those of us who come from communities where we really still have strong rural parts to our States. 
I think the bill's focus on applying Pell grants to summer school is really important, especially for our `nontraditional students,' students who are older and going back to school. The bill's coordinated response dealing with violence on campus between local law enforcement and the institutions of higher education is real important; the bill's coordinated response to the problem of binge drinking also is terribly important. 
I think there is much in this higher education bill that is important for our country. I thank colleagues. I also thank Roger Wolfson, who has been working with me, on my staff, and has really been responsible for some of the good amendments that we were, working with others, able to incorporate into this legislation. I have not covered all in this legislation that I feel very strongly about. 
But I want to speak to one flaw in this higher education bill. I am going to speak about this with, I guess, some indignation. When we passed this higher education bill on the floor of the Senate, there was an amendment that dealt with the welfare bill, though it was an amendment to the higher education bill--and that is where it should have been. It passed 56 to 42; 11 Republicans joined Senate Democrats in supporting the provision. There were over 125 higher education and civil rights organizations that supported this amendment; there were strong editorials in the Boston Globe, the New York Times, Minnesota Star and Tribune and other newspapers around the country. As I think about Senators who were out here on the floor speaking about this, the Senator who maybe spoke with the most eloquence, certainly the strongest feeling, was the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford. 
Any number of Senators supported this amendment which I am about to describe, even though they also supported the welfare bill. I did not support the welfare bill. They did. I will talk about that in a moment. But this amendment said nothing other than this: That any State that wanted to would be allowed to allow a parent, a welfare parent--almost all of these parents are women; I think the Chair, from what I know of him, would agree with me that men ought to be taking more responsibility for their children as well--that when it comes to single parents, mothers--we would allow States to allow these women to complete at least 2 years of higher education without having any State penalized for doing so. 
Wyoming would not have to provide these two years, Minnesota would not have to provide these two years, but if Wyoming and Minnesota decide it would be better for these women to be able to complete 2 years of higher education, which could be vocational-technical or another program like a nursing assistant program, then the State should be able to do that and the State would not be penalized. It would not count against the State meeting its work participation requirement. 
That amendment passed the U.S. Senate, and then it went to conference committee. 
Mr. President, this is a single photograph. It is of Troyce Williams, but there are a lot of women like her. This all translates into human terms. She is a single mother of four children who is at the Minneapolis Community College, a community and technical college, at which she is trying to get her higher education completed. There are many, many women like her. 
What I felt good about as a Senator was that after this amendment passed, we got all sorts of calls and all sorts of letters from people all across the country. This was an amendment that would have really made a difference. It would have really made a difference because what a lot of people in our community colleges and in our higher education community were saying was that 
we were going to speak up for our students. This was a mistake we made when we passed the TANF. When we passed the welfare bill we probably should have been clear at the Federal level we would have some language that would give States the flexibility, if they wanted to, to allow these parents to complete at least 2 years of higher education. 
Now I am not going to bore anybody here today about all of the statistics that make the point that every single citizen in this country understands: If you are able to go on and complete 2 years or 4 years of higher education, you are going to be in a better position to find a good job and give your children the care you know they need and deserve. 
This amendment passes. Then we go to conference committee. I am just furious about what happened in conference committee. We met, and the House conferees, the majority House conferees, Republicans, said no to the amendment, and they were not interested in talking about anything else by way of maybe something else we could do that would make a difference. 
Mr. President, it is just simply bitterly ironic that the very women who are on the path to economic self-sufficiency, because they are trying to complete at least 2 years of higher education, all too often get driven out of school because States feel like they will be penalized if they do not get these women into the workforce. Then they get into the workforce and they find a job at $6 an hour, and then 1 year later they lose their medical assistance and they and their children are worse off. Whereas, if they could complete 2 years of higher education they would be better off. 
We come to conference committee and I am just going to repeat what happened. I do no damage to the truth, because I want to make a point about what is at stake here--not just on this amendment but, sort of, politics in our country. The Chair may not agree with me, but I get to speak my piece on the floor of the Senate. 
Now, the Republicans in the House come in and they say, `We want this Wellstone amendment out.' Forget my name. I am not important. `We want this amendment out.' And I will not use names because there is no one here to debate me and that would not be fair. On the House side, they are not here to debate me. So the person who is kind of the point person in making this argument says, `This would be a terrible amendment.' And then I hear everybody saying, `This welfare bill was hallmark legislation. It is the best thing we have done in a half a century. It is so successful that we cannot touch it--this is nothing less than an effort to undermine this welfare bill.' 
Mr. President, first of all, a lot of people who voted for this amendment did not vote for this amendment to undermine the welfare bill. They thought it was a modification that was needed. They thought that the welfare bill would work better if we allowed States to allow these women to complete at least 2 years of higher education. But I am going to make another point. 
I then turned--and for all I know the Chair was there at the conference committee--I turned to people who made this presentation and I said you keep talking about how successful this welfare bill is, and you talk about the number of people who are no longer on welfare, the number of women and children who are no longer on our welfare rolls. That is true; maybe 4 or 5 million fewer people. 
My question for you, since you told me how successful it is--even though I would rather debate this in a higher education framework, let me raise this question. Let me raise this question on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We have seen a dramatic reduction in the welfare rolls. Have we seen a dramatic reduction in poverty? Can any of you, from any State, provide me with any data as to where these mothers and children are, what kind of jobs are these mothers receiving? What are the wages? Is there child care available for their 3- or 4-year-old? And when their first and second graders come home alone, sometimes in very dangerous neighborhoods, is there anybody there? 
I have said this on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I am going to say it again. We all say how much we love children. These children count, too. There are children--I know, I have been in these neighborhoods--that go home alone, now, because their mothers are working. They are 7 years old. And they are told to go into their apartment and to lock the door and to take no phone calls, and don't go outside. There are children, when there is beautiful weather, they don't play outside because there is nobody there to take care of them. And these single mothers who are working are terrified as to what might happen to them. 
I asked my colleagues on the Republican side in the House of Representatives, because they eliminate this amendment, since they are talking about how successful the welfare bill is, could they provide me with data? Not one of them could; not one of them. 
I will debate anybody on the floor of the Senate, and I will debate anybody on the floor of the House on this question. The Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal once said, `Ignorance is never random.' Sometimes we don't know what we don't want to know. We don't know what is going on in these States. We don't know what is going on with these mothers and children. 
I can't believe how punitive people can be. I can't believe how harsh they can be. Not one single argument was made against this amendment. Not one bit of data was presented to show that these mothers and these children are better off now, but they just eliminated it because they had the majority. 
I am not whining. I am telling people in the country that this one small example, one small story, tells a larger story about what is at stake. 
I am not out here, by the way, to defend the President's behavior, but I don't think the President is the issue this fall. He is not on the ballot. He will never be on the ballot again running for President. This election, I say to people in Minnesota and people around the country, is about you. 
I just ask, what are these kinds of priorities? Just eliminate an amendment to the higher education bill that allows States to allow women, mothers of small children, to complete 2 years of higher education so they and their children will be better off? Eliminated. 
Do you know that this past June, America--I think it was in June--in the same week this Republican majority voted to give a tax break to people with estates worth more than $17 million, they voted to eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and voted to eliminate summer jobs for kids? Unbelievable. 
People go to their pollsters and say, `What are the issues people care about?' The same Republicans who knocked out this amendment found out it is education--people care about education. They learned how to talk about education--I said `talk about education'--but they have cut funding for education. They have cut funding for K through 12 education. 
It is interesting. We are at a crossroads with education. We are going to see a dramatic increase over the next 10 years by about 10 percent of high school students and about 6 percent of middle school students. The average age of our public school teacher is 50. We are going to need to hire about 1.3 million teachers in our country. We can have all sorts of men and women coming into education with creative new ideas, new energy, and all the rest--it is a golden opportunity--but we can't take advantage of a golden opportunity on a tin-plate budget. 
The same people who are in the majority in the House of Representatives--so punitive, so harsh, so little compassion--voted to deny a single parent, a mother, the opportunity to finish 2 years of higher education so she can do better for her children. They gave a tax break to people with estates worth more than $17 million, but in the same week they eliminated the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program so that in my cold-weather State, elderly people, families with children, have a choice of eating or heating, but not both. They eliminate low-income home energy assistance, so people go cold in the winter, and knock out summer jobs for kids. They give speeches about being for education and children and then cut the budgets. 
That is what is at stake this election. That is what is at stake. My strategy would be for people to turn out this fall. I think the Republican strategy is for people to be turned off this fall, low turnout. 
I hope that from this example people in the country will realize that there is a lot at stake. If you care about a good education for all of our children, if you are committed to the idea of living-wage jobs, if you are committed to the idea of decent health care for every citizen, if you are committed to improving the standard of living for all the people in our country, if you believe that economic and educational opportunities are important, then I make this appeal to people in the country: Don't let people turn you off to politics. 
This election this fall is not about President Clinton. We can talk about his behavior at another time. Nobody needs to approve of it. I don't know of anybody who does. But this election, I say to people in the country, is about you; it is about your families. This election this fall--the President is not on the ballot--is about these kinds of issues. 
I hope people will turn out. I hope you will vote for education. This amendment was knocked out of the higher education bill in spite of the good support of Senator Jeffords. We supported it on the Senate side. I tell you, this Gingrich-House Republican majority agenda is harsh, it is mean-spirited, and if you are committed to education for children, make sure you vote this election. If you believe in the importance of health care and you think good jobs are important, just make sure you vote this election. If you think it is wrong in the same week in the House of Representatives to give a tax break to people with estates over $17 million and eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and eliminate summer jobs for kids--that is exactly what this majority did in the House--you make sure you vote this election. 
If you are angry at people in Washington, DC, and the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate because you think that neither party is doing enough about your concerns and you think too much of our decisionmaking is dominated by special interest or big money or you feel locked out or all the rest, make sure you vote. Don't opt out. Don't let people turn you off. There is a lot at stake in elections in our country, and this is but one example. 
I will get to speak more about this after our caucuses. I see my colleague, Senator Graham. I wanted to start out congratulating my colleagues for the good work on the higher education bill. 
Roger Wolfson, thank you for your help. 
I want to tell you that what happened in the conference committee is just outrageous. There is nothing I can do about it, not now. I will bring this amendment back on the first bill I can amend. Of course, for the last couple of weeks there hasn't been an opportunity to amend any bills. I want to make sure people understand what is at stake. 
In my not too humble opinion--and the Chair is a good friend; I really like him, and I hope it is mutual, so I don't mean this in a personal way--but what is at stake in these fall elections is critical. 
I say to people in the country, this small story tells a larger story. I shudder at the thought of Speaker Gingrich or, for that matter, on the Senate side as well, there being even more of a majority or more power, because I think it will be an agenda that will move our country back 60 years. People have learned how to talk about education, I say to my colleague from Florida, but the budgets don't reflect that. On the House side, they cut funding for education. There was no action whatsoever on health care. There is very little concern about what I call some really important family-value issues, and this is but one example. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Florida.  
Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know the time in the Senate for my colleague, Senator Ford, is limited. But I want to say to him, when we received 56 votes for this amendment on the floor of the Senate, in the aftermath of that a lot of people were just thrilled around the country, especially a lot of these mothers and a lot of the higher education community and a lot of States like Kentucky, and others that wanted to allow mothers to complete 2 years of education. I am not naive about this. I don't think we would have ever gotten the 56 votes if not for the voice of Senator Ford. 
I wish he would not be leaving here. I don't think there is anybody more respected. I know we all come out here on the floor and we say these things about one another. But, you know what, I am sure most of the time it is sincere, but in the case of Senator Ford, when I hear him speak I just wish he wasn't leaving. 
I think what happened with him and certainly what happened with me is I would travel in Minnesota and I would go to community colleges and maybe speak at a gathering. Maybe there would be a couple of hundred students, the majority of them were women, most of them were older, most of them were going back to school, and a good number of them were single parents. Their plea was: Please, Senator Wellstone, the only thing we are asking is try and let us finish our 2 years here.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the other thing that was interesting, this amendment just allows States to do this if they want to. No State was required to. Any State that thought it would be better for many of these women and children and their families, to allow these women to finish 2 years of education so they get a better job and their children would be better off, would be allowed to do so. 
I will just say to my colleague from Kentucky, I was there in the conference committee. I think it was punitive for this amendment to be eliminated. I never heard anybody make a credible argument against it, I really didn't. There was not any credible argument made against it. I said here this morning, and I will say it one more time, I think this small story tells the larger story, the same Republican majority in the House, as we look to the elections in the fall, the same Republican majority in the same week in June--one more time, this bears repeating--voted to give a tax break to people with estates worth more than $17 million and at the same time voted to eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and eliminate summer jobs for kids. 
This is a kind of meanness that I think is just simply not the best for America. I want to say to all of my colleagues, I am going to really miss having Senator Ford with me. The first bill that comes out here, the first vehicle--if it is tomorrow, it is tomorrow; if it is next week, it is next week; if it is after, in January or February--I am going to be coming right back with this amendment again, right back with this amendment again. Because all across our country there are a lot of these women who have just essentially been driven out of school. 
I cannot believe that is what we are doing. There is not one person I know, just on the basis of common wisdom about this, who doesn't know that a mother and her children are going to be better off if those mothers are allowed to complete 2 years of higher education. So we will be back. We will be back and we will pass this amendment. 
Mr. President, I, again, will just finish speaking about this amendment if I refer to Latashie Brown, who is a single mother in her thirties from Minnesota. She decided to return to college to enhance her nursing skills and improve her earning power. 
You have a single mother, she wants to go back to school, it is 2 years to get that associate's degree to go into nursing, to be a nursing assistant. And too many women like Miss Brown are just essentially being told you have to leave school because the States get penalized for not meeting the work requirements. We will be back.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to bring up one other matter on the floor today because we are in another fight. You know, it seems like, with about 2 weeks to go, there is a whole lot that is actually going on here in the Congress. I think the tragedy of it is people may not be aware of all of it. But I will tell you, one issue that people in Minnesota, especially the farmers and people in greater Minnesota, are well aware of--we have a crisis in agriculture. We have a lot of people who are faced with record-low prices. There is no way farmers can cash-flow on the basis of $1.40 a bushel of corn. 
Those farmers are being driven off the land. As those farmers get driven off the land, that is the death knell for many of our rural communities because it is those family farmers who live in those communities and buy in those communities that support our schools and support our small businesses and support our churches and support our synagogues--you name it. That is what is happening. 
We put together a $7 billion package. Senator Baucus from Montana was part of that effort. I was hopeful because, whereas before our August recess I heard Senators come to the floor and say `stay the course.' The Freedom to Farm bill--which I call the Freedom to Fail bill--it is the market. Stay the course. Stay the course. 
I was thinking to myself, it is easy for people here to say `stay the course' while farmers in Minnesota are just being driven off their land. 
That changed. Now, finally I think, at least I hope that everybody recognizes there is a crisis out there. I also believe that many people realize this Freedom to Fail bill is not working. We just eliminated the leverage for farmers to get a fair price in the marketplace. We capped the loan rate at $1.89 for a bushel of corn. 
What in the world are we doing supporting a piece of legislation that keeps prices down when prices have plummeted to the point where you could be the best farmer in the world and you cannot make it? 
So we put together a $7 billion package that has indemnity payments for farmers that have experienced crop failure and have had to deal with scab disease, had to deal with terrible weather like wet weather in Northwest Minnesota, and we did a couple of other things, the most important of which was to take the cap off the loan rate 
so that we could get the prices up and have some kind of safety net for farmers who otherwise are going to go under. 
Mr. President, we had a farm rally in Worthington, MN, just Saturday a week ago--not this past Saturday. There were petitions--I won't include them in the Record because there are too many--there were petitions that were passed out that talked about the importance of a fair price for family farmers. 
I thank all of the farmers and small business people and lenders who came to this rally--almost 1,000 people were there--in Worthington. These petitions are going out all across our State. Ted Winter, who is house majority leader, a farmer himself, has been one of the people who has taken the lead. 
This is a plea from Main Street businesses in rural America, a plea from family farmers, a plea from rural citizens. They are saying to people in the U.S. Senate, `We are not asking for a handout, we are asking for a fair shake. We are asking you to take some action that corrects a major deficiency in a piece of legislation you passed'--the freedom to fail bill--`which is great for the grain companies but puts us family farmers under.' 
What we got yesterday by the same Republican majority that I was talking about earlier--you talk about partisanship. I don't know if it is partisanship on the floor of the Senate right now or just an honest-to-goodness debate. I argue that any majority that gives away a break to people who have over $17 million estates and cuts low-income energy assistance--those are priorities that are distorted priorities. I don't think that is the goodness of our country. 
I argue that any majority that eliminates an educational opportunity for a single parent and her children--that is punitive. 
And I argue that this package that was put together yesterday in the ag appropriations conference committee shut out--I say to my colleague from Montana--shut out the Democratic proposal. It is way too little, way too late, doesn't get the price up, deficient in all sorts of ways, and will not do the job. It is like my Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate labored mightily and produced a mouse. It is an insult. 
We will on Thursday--Yom Kippur is tomorrow; it is a religious holiday for some of us--Thursday we will have a motion to recommit this to the conference committee. We will keep coming back and fighting it. 
I say to family farmers in Minnesota, `Look, $4 billion doesn't get the price up, it isn't targeted, it helps landowners, not necessarily producers, doesn't help soybean growers, doesn't deal with the real issue.' 
People are not looking for handouts. They are not looking for more payments. They want to get the price up. I say to farmers in Minnesota, `Look, I have given this everything I have--everything I have,' or `everything I had,' if it is in the past tense. I will tell you that whatever is out there is just not going to do the job. I refuse to be a part of a phony argument where we pretend like we have come up with some agricultural crisis relief bill that does not provide the necessary relief for people so they can stay on their land and farm their land. This is not going to do the job. 
You can say, `Well, but this goes part of the way.' I suppose a quarter of a loaf of bread is better than none, but I am not going to be party to the argument that this is going to help the farmers or is anywhere near commensurate to the task before us. 
The President has said that he is going to veto this. The administration is hanging in there tough. Let me tell you, Mr. President, I don't always agree with you on policies. I am a Democrat and quite often in disagreement with some of what the administration does. But I give credit where credit is due. 
I am glad the President is hanging tough on this. I am glad that the President and the Vice President and Secretary Glickman--especially Secretary Glickman--are there for family farmers. I hope he vetoes this, and then I hope we sit down at the bargaining table and come back with a farm relief package that really provides relief. 
I am tired of symbolic politics. We get ourselves in big trouble when we pretend like we put something together that is going to do the job. The Democrats' proposal, I say to my colleague from Montana, was barely a start. It was the best we felt we could do. It did not get the prices up there. It did not get the relief there. It was not all that we needed to do, but it was a credible start. 
What has come out of this agricultural appropriations conference committee by the Republican majority--let me go on record and say this--is not a great step forward, it is a great leap sideways. It is not a step forward for family farmers, it is a great leap sideways. The family farmers in Minnesota and the people in greater Minnesota deserve better. They deserve better, and I am going to keep on fighting and raising heck on the floor of the Senate and in every other way I can until they get better. I believe I will be joined by many of my other colleagues as well.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will conclude my statement by quoting the third to the last paragraph from the commentary of Dr. Calvin, who is a physician and a farmer: 
Is the future agricultural landscape destined to be one of industrial mega-farms, dotted with a few decorative hobby farms? I hope not. If we are to have an agriculture that is safe, local, environmentally sound and affordable, government must serve as the impartial referee. The difficult debate will be in defining fair rules. The current situation favors the interests of agribusiness. Because of the influence that money has on the political system, change will be difficult. 
That is true, change will be difficult, but not for a moment, those of us who come from States like Minnesota, do we intend to give up on this fight. The family farm structure of agriculture and food policy is our most precious priority. We have just begun to fight on this. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have come to the floor today to speak about Kosovo for their words. 
Mr. President, I rise to call for urgent Presidential action to forestall a humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo. Unless immediate and determined action by the U.S. and our western allies is taken to address this situation, it is clear we will begin to face a massive loss of civilian lives with the onset of winter in the region as early as mid-October. 
The western media offers new reports daily on the rapidly deteriorating situation there. Candid assessments by Administration officials acknowledge the growing crisis. Systematic and brutal military action by Serbian forces, accelerated during their summer-long offensive against UCK forces, has forced an estimated 300,000 or more ethnic Albanians to flee their homes. In recent weeks Serb forces have shelled entire villages, not just rebel positions, forcing more civilians to flee. While many have fled as refugees to neighboring countries, most of these displaced persons remain inside Kosovo and are now vulnerable to exposure, starvation, disease and further Serb military attack. I understand that Assistant Secretary of State for Refugees Julia Taft concluded during her recent visit there that over 210 villages in the region have already been looted, and many torched, by Serbian security forces. 
With winter approaching, international relief agencies now fear that tens of thousands of refugees without food or shelter could face death. By some estimates there are 50,000 to 100,000 people in Kosovo living out in the open, without any shelter. Unless they can return to their homes or be provided adequate shelter within the next few weeks they may die of exposure. 
Our respected former colleagues Senator Bob Dole recently returned from Kosovo warning that there is a `human catastrophe in the making.' President Clinton said last week that there is a potential for a `major humanitarian disaster' in Kosovo and that it is `important that we move as quickly as possible with our allies to avert a tragedy.' The President cautioned: `We don't want a repeat of Bosnia.' 
The President is right. We cannot wait any longer to take more vigorous action to force Serbia to cease making this crisis worse and to allow necessary humanitarian relief into the area. Serbia must comply with the persistent demands of the Contact Group: (1) cease attacks on civilian populations, and withdraw its forces used to repress civilians; (2) permit the establishment of an effective international observer group in Kosovo; (3) allow refugees and displaced persons to return to their homes safely, under international supervision; (4) allow unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations and supplies; and (5) make rapid progress in the dialogue with the Kosovar leadership. 
In recent days there have been some positive developments in the UN Security Council and in NATO which indicate that those organizations may be ready to take necessary action. The Security Council is contemplating a resolution stating that the situation in Kosovo `constitutes a threat to peace and security' that impels the council to demand an immediate cease-fire. This demand would be in accordance with Chapter 7 of the UN charter. There are indications that Russia may be willing to support this resolution. The resolution does not call for the use of force, but I note that Chapter 7 authorizes the use of armed force by NATO members to compel compliance with the council's orders. 
Parallel progress is being made at NATO headquarters in Brussels where the U.S. has asked the North Atlantic Council to canvass member countries to determine which countries are willing to provide personnel and equipment to military operations in Kosovo. This action will be useful in precipitating consultations between NATO governments and their respective parliaments and bringing into the open the debate on military options. 
I applaud these developments and call on the UN and NATO to accelerate them. 
I also want to commend U.S. Ambassador Chris Hill for his persistent diplomatic efforts. The U.S. should continue to work toward a political solution to this problem along the lines pursued by Ambassador Hill. At the same time, though, we must also proceed with a more vigorous and sustained high-level multilateral effort to pressure President Milosevic to comply fully with Contact Group demands. 
Mr. President, I want to outline some steps that I hope the administration will proceed with. 
I urge the Administration therefore to proceed immediately with a series of steps designed to prevent the looming humanitarian crisis and to prepare for possible implementation of more forceful options developed by NATO planners. 
I urge the administration today on the floor of the U.S. Senate to proceed immediately with these steps. 
These actions include: 
Moving forward now, under NATO auspices, with the pre-deployment phase of NATO military plans on Kosovo, including securing base rights agreements in the region, immediately assessing the contributions of each NATO member in the event military action is necessary, and then forward-deploying appropriate levels of NATO military forces and equipment, thus preparing us to take any appropriate military action that may be necessary to secure Serb compliance with Contact Group demands, and with international law regarding the treatment of Kosovar citizens; bolstering border security efforts through preventive NATO force deployments which can increase regional stability and assist in international monitoring and anti-arms smuggling efforts; leading an immediate multilateral effort, at the United Nations and through regional bodies like the European Union, to tighten the existing sanctions regime on Serbia, and to re-impose the total airflight and investment bans, and other sanctions lifted after signing of the Dayton Peace Accords, and to consider reimposing the trade embargo, coupled with renewed enforcement initiatives to prevent the flourishing of black markets under a full embargo; accelerating U.S. and NATO logistical support for the ongoing international humanitarian aid effort in Kosovo, including pre-deployment of humanitarian supplies in Kosovo in anticipation of winter distribution by NGOs--but only in a way which avoids absolutely the prospect of a repeat of the disgraceful `safe haven' disaster of Srebenica; pressing for more extensive access for human rights monitoring in Kosovo by internationally recognized organizations, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and non-governmental monitors, and providing appropriate support and assistance for their efforts; and encouraging the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia immediately to send its Chief Prosecutor to Belgrade and Kosovo; increasing aid and intelligence support to the Tribunal; and assisting them in placing forensics teams on the ground there, thus signaling to all parties that the Tribunal is committed to prosecuting war crimes committed in Kosovo including attacks on innocent civilians, and has begun to actually gather evidence to support potential indictments against perpetrators--and their commanders and political leadership to whom they answer. 
I believe it is essential that these actions be taken as quickly as possible. We must act now, before the onset of winter in Kosovo, to prevent a potential humanitarian tragedy of historic proportions. I also recognize that these steps in themselves may not be sufficient to force Serbia to comply with the Contact Group's demands in a timely manner, and that further NATO military actions may need to be considered if the situation in Kosovo has not substantially improved, the massacres of civilians continues, and unimpeded access for humanitarian relief workers has not been granted. 
Mr. President, again, I thank my colleagues who have spoken today on this matter. I do think it is important that we speak out. I think in the last couple of days we have seen positive developments in the U.N. Security Council and NATO which indicate that these organizations may be ready to take necessary action. But I wanted to outline today some options which I believe we need to consider and which I think will communicate a message to Milosevic that we are deadly serious; to talk actually about taking military action is very serious. It is always the last option. But I believe, at the minimum, we can do some predeployment phases of NATO military plans. 
I think we can bolster some of our border security efforts. I think we can tighten the sanctions regime on Serbia. I think we can accelerate United States and NATO logistical support for international humanitarian aid efforts in Kosovo. I think we can press for more extensive access for human rights monitoring by some internationally recognized organizations. And I think we can make it clear that we are going to give the International Criminal Tribunal all the support it needs as well. 
None of this may be enough--I want to say this one more time in this Chamber. None of these steps may be sufficient to force Serbia to comply with the contact group's demands in a timely manner and further military action may be necessary. But if these actions are not taken as quickly as possible, we are--Senator Dole is right--going to see a humanitarian crisis of tragic proportions. We are going to see a lot of men, women and children who are going to die unless we take action. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to mention to my colleague from Kentucky that tomorrow in Minnesota we are going to have a service for Muriel Humphrey--Senator Humphrey. Both Humphreys were Senators. I wish to express the appreciation, love and affection all of the people of Minnesota feel toward the Humphrey family. 
Much has been written about Muriel Humphrey. I had a chance to get to meet her. I did not know her nearly as well as other Minnesotans, but I can tell you she was a wonderful person, very caring toward her family, very caring toward the great Senator Hubert Humphrey, a really fine Senator--the first woman to serve in the Senate from the State of Minnesota in her own right--and, I think most important of all, a wonderful, wonderful model for public service. It is a great loss for Minnesota. It is a great loss for our country. Muriel Humphrey will be a very special person to all of us in Minnesota for many years to come. We will never forget her.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
I thank my colleague from Iowa. 
I do not think I am going to be able to do justice to the question that is before us. There was a bit of confusion. We were over hearing President Nelson Mandela and lost some valuable time on the floor, although I must say I would have never traded that experience to hear President Mandela. 
Mr. President, for the last few months, we have been so absorbed with the crisis at the White House I am afraid we have neglected another crisis that might end up having a far greater impact on ordinary working Americans. I am talking about a global economic crisis whose effects are already being felt on our shores. 
The situation in the global economy today is much more than troubling; it is dangerous. I believe we must act now to stop the world from slipping into a deflationary spiral. And by the way, I would like to give Bill Greider, and his book `One World: Ready or Not,' just a little bit of mention. I think Bill Greider deserves a tremendous amount of credit. That book, written about two years ago, was really prophetic about where the international economy might go. 
As I said, I believe we must act now to stop the world from slipping into a deflationary spiral. Surely part of the solution--not the whole solution--is for the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates significantly. 
I hope that Alan Greenspan, Chairman Greenspan, today in his testimony will, indeed, signal that he is ready to do that. This may be only one part of the solution, but it is an important part, and that is what this Sense-of-the-Congress resolution is all about. 
Mr. President, this global economic crisis is unlike anything many of us have ever experienced in our lifetimes. For the first time since the 1930s, we see the GDP falling in over one-quarter of the world economy. Last week, President Clinton called this `the greatest financial challenge in the last half-century.' And he was right. 
If we choose to do nothing, we will have little hope of escaping from this crisis unscathed. As Chairman Greenspan recently testified, we cannot forever be an oasis of growth when so much of the world's economy is contracting. 
Lowering interest rates will address the global crisis in several ways. It will supply some much needed liquidity to a world economy starved by massive currency devaluations. It should help restart capital flows to crisis countries. Lower rates should also weaken the dollar, making it easier for foreign borrowers to repay their dollar-dominated debt. Boosting the yen against the dollar should make other Asian countries more competitive and help stabilize their economies. The end result should be higher world economic growth and less instability in the financial markets. 
Mr. President, I cannot emphasize enough how important this Sense-of-the-Congress amendment is, because we are attempting to send a signal here. I come from the Midwest. We see a contraction in the farm economy. We see farmers driven off the land because of record-low prices. But what I also see is an absolutely impossible situation right now where what is happening in this world economy is surely going to affect us. And there is no question that, by lowering interest rates in coordination with other countries--like Germany and the G-7 countries--we can at least increase demand. 
If there is one thing we must do, it is increase demand in all of our economies so that people will be able to consume, so we will have markets to sell to. Bill Greider was right. The major threat right now, not only to the international economy but to our own economy, is not inflation. It is deflation. 
All the arguments about the NAIRU--the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment--don't stand up. It is not true that when you have low levels of unemployment you automatically set into gear an inflationary spiral in your economy. That has not happened. There is no evidence that it will happen. 
The No. 1 enemy right now is not inflation, but the whole question of deflation, the whole question of a depression in a good part of the international economy which is going to dramatically, crucially, affect the quality of our lives, our children's lives and our grandchildren's lives. 
The Federal Reserve Board, led by Mr. Greenspan, must lower short-term interest rates. They are too high. It makes no sense whatever--from the point of view of the best macroeconomic management, from the point of view of economic performance, from the point of view of stimulating demand in these economies, from the point of view of coordinating with other countries like Germany--for the Federal Reserve Board not to lower the federal funds rate. That is what this resolution calls for. That is why I am pleased to join my colleague from Iowa. 
This is why a rising chorus of voices is now calling for lower rates. Many of them are conservatives. They include the Wall Street Journal, Jack Kemp, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable, Stephen Roache, C. Fred Bergsten, Roger Altman, Steve Forbes, and many others. 
But there are also many who don't share my sense of alarm. A few may simply be afraid to say anything that could trigger a panic. Others may not see any need to take precautions against a forecasted hurricane--especially when the skies directly above us are sunny and clear. Well, maybe they are right. Maybe this storm will veer off course. But what if they're wrong? 
Some of my colleagues may well say, `We already have low interest rates. The Fed hasn't raised short-term rates for a year and a half.' True enough. But if you adjust those rates for inflation, they've actually been rising for some time. Chairman Greenspan himself testified earlier this year that `Statistically, it is a fact that real interest rates are higher now than they have been on the average of the post World War II period.' In fact, the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate hasn't been this high since 1989. 
Unfortunately, there has been a strong bias, at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, against lowering rates, though this may be changing as we speak. The reason for this is simple: an inordinate fear of inflation. But inflation today stands at 1.6 percent, down from 3 percent in 1996. Where is the evidence of any inflationary pressure on the horizon? This downward trend cannot be attributed solely to the Asian crisis, either: the producer price index fell for the first seven months of 1997, before the crisis even began. To quote Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, `People who cry about inflation are in some other universe of reality right now.' 
Moreover, an expected slowdown in economic growth should douse any possible inflationary pressures. Corporate earnings in the second quarter were down 1.3 percent from the previous year. Economic growth slowed from 5.5 percent in the first quarter to 1.6 percent in the second. The OECD predicts lower U.S. growth next year. Chairman Greenspan himself has acknowledged that `there are the first signs of erosion at the edges, especially in manufacturing.' Manufacturing capacity utilization is at a six year low, commodity prices are falling, and farm debt is the highest it's been since 1985. And the Fed says its monetary policy must be based on forecasts of economic conditions 6 to 9 months in the future! 
In his speech last week, President Clinton recognized that these new circumstances call for a reexamination of some of our most basic economic assumptions. `For most of the last 30 years, the United States and the rest of the world has been preoccupied by inflation,' he said. `But clearly the balance of risks has now shifted, with a full quarter of the world's population living in countries with declining economic growth or negative economic growth. Therefore, I believe the industrial world's chief priority today, plainly, is to spur growth.' 
The Federal Reserve's obsession with inflation-fighting can be traced back to the so-called NAIRU [Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment] theory. What NAIRU boils down to is this: it's a belief that lowering unemployment too much will cause inflation to spiral out of control. Tragically, this theory has too often stood in the way of policies that would reduce unemployment. 
Yet it seems to have little, if any, correlation to our actual economic experience. For four years now we've had unemployment rates below 6 percent. They've been under 5 percent for well over a year. During that time, inflation has been falling, not rising. The fact is, there's little reason to believe low unemployment causes inflation to come unhinged. It seems to me that this NAIRU theory is about as out-moded as the Nehru jacket. And frankly, I have serious doubts whether either of these fads was ever really defensible. 
In the past, the Fed has focused on fighting inflation over all other considerations, which puts it at odds with its own statutory mandate. Let me remind my colleagues, once again, that the Federal Reserve is a creature of Congress. The 1946 Employment Act directs the Fed to pursue policies of `maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.' The 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Act amendments call for policies of `full employment,' `balanced growth,' and `reasonable price stability.' Instead, it seems the Fed sees its mandate as stifling real wage growth. 
Sometimes Washington seems like a different world than the one where most Americans live, and never more so than when it's engulfed in scandal. But it can seem like a pretty odd place even in more normal times. In testimony before Congress, Fed Chairman Greenspan has seemed to express satisfaction that job insecurity keeps workers from demanding higher wages. More recently he has voiced concern that wages are rising, despite the fact that wage growth has not kept up with productivity. I'm not sure which is more outrageous: that anybody in a position of power in this country would say such things, or that so few people would be bothered by them. 
In all fairness, the Fed has resisted the temptation to raise short-term rates for some time now. That's probably because falling unemployment has not led to higher wages until very recently, and inflation has continued on its downward path. But now, in the seventh year of this economic recovery, we are finally starting to see signs of wage growth. Real wages have risen 2.6 percent annually for the typical American worker since 1996, though they have still not regained their 1989 levels. And the trend toward income inequality has also begun to slow. 
This is good news, and it is a tremendous breakthrough. The mystery of falling wages and rising inequality over the past three decades turns out to be not so mysterious after all. The fact is, we know how to raise wages and reduce inequality. We do not have to reinvent the wheel. Among other things, we need to maintain low unemployment over a sustained period. We've done this before and we can do it again. Surveying the U.S. economy since World War II, economist James Galbraith finds that income inequality has generally risen when unemployment was above 5 percent and fallen when unemployment was below 5 percent. 
Simply put, we need to pursue a policy of full employment. The 1998 Report of the Council of Economic Advisers hails recent trends in income 
inequality and concludes, `Maintaining a full employment economy is essential if this progress is to continue.' The experience of the last two years should drive that lesson home. It would be a tragedy if an unjustified fear of rising wages or an economic downturn kept us from continuing that progress. With economic growth falling overseas and the growing danger of deflationary aftershocks here at home, I believe the Fed needs to cut interest rates now. 
There are few things, I think, that would improve the lives of ordinary working Americans more than full employment. As the 1998 Report of the Council of Economic Advisers says:  
A high employment economy brings enormous economic and social benefits. Essential to personal economic security is the knowledge that work is available to those who seek it, at wages sufficient to keep them and their families out of poverty. A tight labor market encourages the confidence of job losers that they will be able to return to work, lures discouraged workers back into the labor force, enhances the prospects of those already at work to get ahead, enables those who want or need to switch jobs to do so without a long period of joblessness, and lowers the duration of a typical unemployment spell. . . . Wasted resources from not producing at potential, together with the human cost of unemployment, are intolerable; the elimination of this waste is the principal benefit of a sustained return to full employment. 
As James Galbraith argues in his powerful new book, Created Unequal, lower interest rates and full employment help sustain not only a healthy economy, but also a healthy society. Lower rates make it easier to balance the budget. They help reduce inequality by lowering unemployment and reducing poverty, by preserving a competitive dollar that doesn't destabilize wages, and by checking the unearned income of top earners. They ease social strains by pushing up wages and lifting the burden of private debt. For all these reasons, in a full employment economy, citizens are more able and willing to make necessary investments in education, training, infrastructure, research, and other public goods. 
But the flip side of this picture is not so rosy. Inequality has been rising since about 1970, and today is the highest it's been since the Great Depression. Growing inequality brings out the worst in us. It eats away at middle class solidarity. It encourages those who feel secure about their life chances to disavow any connection to their brethren in need. Growing inequality finds expression in bitter struggles over issues such as affirmative action, welfare, crime, entitlements, and even intelligence. And if income inequality had not so undermined middle class solidarity, I don't think the campaign to privatize Social Security would have ever gotten off the ground. 
There are specific responses to each of these challenges, but the larger issue is the erosion of solidarity among Americans of different economic circumstances. The answer, it seems to me, is clear. We must rebuild that solidarity with higher wages and lower inequality. These lessons have a direct bearing on one of the paramount issues before Congress today: an America with rising wages and declining inequality is an America that need not worry about the future of Social Security. 
What is true for the American economy is equally true for the world economy. The best global citizens are countries that generate their own domestic demand, and healthy demand depends on rising wages and lower inequality. There's been a lot of talk about virtuous cycles lately. Well, when income gains are broadly shared, it creates a virtuous cycle of mass purchasing power, growth, savings, and new investment. We can promote this kind of good citizenship by helping other countries raise their wages from the bottom up--through higher minimum wages, recognition of labor rights, and fiscal and monetary stimulus. 
This kind of policy would be good not only for them, but for us too. And it would be good for the global system as a whole. We cannot forever be the buyer of last resort. We cannot forever help other countries develop economically by absorbing all their manufacturing exports. They need to create their own domestic demand. Trade should be a complement to healthy demand at home, not a substitute for weak demand. Otherwise we cannot escape the trap of excess production and overcapacity, with too many goods being produced and not enough prosperous consumers to buy them. As the AFL-CIO urged back in January, `The United States, Europe, and Japan must work together to stimulate domestic demand in the developing economies and avert a dangerous tendency toward global deflation.' 
Needless to say, we haven't been doing that. It certainly hasn't helped that, working through the IMF and other multilateral institutions, we have imposed deflation on countries in Asia and the rest of the world. We have depressed foreign demand by insisting that other governments cut spending, close banks, weaken labor laws, and raise interest rates. And we've insisted that they deregulate financial markets to remove any checks on often destabilizing flows of foreign capital. As the AFL-CIO said back in February, `These terms may solve some short-term credibility problems with foreign investors, but will necessarily exacerbate the tensions, inequality, and instability of the global economy.' That, I believe, is exactly the problem facing us today. 
This is a time for bold new thinking. In his speech last Monday, President Clinton called on Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin to convene a meeting of their counterparts in the G-7 and key developing countries within the next 30 days to strengthen the international financial architecture for the 21st Century. Fifty years ago, he said, we learned to tame the cycle of booms and busts that had plagued national economies, and we must now do the same for the international economy. 
But what does that entail, exactly? Countries must be able to reap the benefits of free-flowing capital in a way that is safe and sustainable, the President said. The IMF should emphasize pro-growth budget, tax, and monetary policies. The World Bank should embark on a new `social compact' initiative focusing on job assistance and basic needs of children and the elderly. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank should both double their support for the social safety net in Asia. 
Meanwhile, it was reported yesterday that British Prime Minister Tony Blair has joined the call to restructure the institutions and rules governing the global financial system. And the IMF just released a report endorsing the kind of capital controls Chile has maintained for years to discourage destabilizing short-term capital inflows. This appears to represent a 180 degree about-face from its previous dogged insistence on liberalizing capital markets. 
These are extraordinary developments. I believe they are a sign of the seriousness of the crisis we face. They also indicate that deeply entrenched assumptions are now being reexamined. That's something we should welcome and encourage. 
I believe we can prevent the worst from happening, but we must act now. These are times that cry out for American leadership. The most pressing need, and our most immediate priority, must be to deliver a preemptive strike against deflation. At the next meeting of the FOMC, Federal Open Market Committee, on September 29, the Fed should lower interest rates significantly.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for some reason I don't understand, as well, why Senators are unwilling to speak to this issue and provide our judgment about what should be done. We don't talk about monetary policy much. 
The Business Roundtable says, `The President and Congress should encourage the Federal Reserve to lower U.S. interest rates.' The Business Roundtable doesn't fit into the label `liberal,' although I think that label is irrelevant. Why has the Business Roundtable taken that position? What is it about real interest rates that is so important to the people you represent in Iowa and the people I represent in Minnesota? Can we talk for a moment about that?

I will ask the question to the Senator from Iowa who gives the lengthy answers. I think it is just incredible, I say to my colleague from Iowa, it is just incredible how this whole issue of real interest rates and monetary policy--which has such a critical impact on small business, on farmers, and on industry and housing --is taken off the table. We are even unwilling to give our best judgment as to what the Federal Reserve ought to do. It is amazing to me. 
Let me ask you this question: Would you agree----

Mr. WELLSTONE. I want to hear the Senator's answer, because this is a critical issue. Would you agree that our taking the lead in lowering short-term interest rates also would be critical to what the Germans might do, what the other G-7 countries might do? Shouldn't this be put in the context of a coordinated response at an international level, dealing with this contraction of the international economy, dealing with this problem of deflation? Maybe you could spell out a little bit what you mean. 
In other words, the Senator talked about the effects of high real interests rates within our country, but could we not also say another part of the argument is the effect on exchange rates? That a strong dollar ultimately means other countries will try and export their way out of crisis? That they will dump a lot of products on our market and end up competing with workers in our country? 
Aren't you really saying that, in the absence of something being done through monetary policy, we are not going to be able to get enough demand going in these countries? That we are not going to have enough economic stimulus? That people are not going to have money to buy products, which would help create jobs? And that the major problem is not going to be what you were talking about--inflation, which the Fed seems to be excessively focused on--but deflation? Am I not correct that that is part of what is going on?

But you are also talking about our taking the lead in trying to fashion a coordinated response at an international level to deal with what has happened. We have a depression in part of the international economy.

Mr. WELLSTONE. My last question, I say to my colleague--and I look forward to coming to the floor and having a further discussion about this. I hope we are wrong. But I think this discussion of political economy, both in terms of what is happening to the global economy and also what is happening in our own economy, is going to become a very, very critical issue. We are seeing it already in agriculture. But this is just the beginning. 
But this is my last question. Is it not also true that, when they talk about the alleged danger of unemployment continuing to go down, that this would also bring up the bargaining power of wage earners? It wouldn't be just a matter of unemployment going down. This would also mean that people in a tight labor market would see their wages go up and would have a better chance of working at living-wage jobs? I think the Federal Reserve Board tends to be more responsive to bond holders, financial people, and the creditors, and they want to keep interest rates up. 
Isn't it also true that having real interest rates so high is one of the reasons we have a maldistribution of wealth and income today in this country? We have this paradox of some people being able to purchase all the goods that make life richer in possibility. But then we also have so many families--maybe the majority of families in our country--who cannot. Maybe this is one of these hidden issues that we don't talk about, with everything swirling around in Washington, that so many families are still struggling to make ends meet and do well by their kids. 
What would be the harm in moving toward full employment? What would be the harm in making sure that wage earners make better wages? What would be the harm in having more people have access to living-wage jobs? Isn't the whole question of real interest rates one piece of it?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is no doubt that more and more Americans are turning to the consumer bankruptcy system and the financial protection it offers. More than 1.3 million families filed for bankruptcy last year. Where there is fraud and abuse we must take steps to reduce and eliminate it. But this bill will not help reduce fraud. It will encourage riskier lending habits by credit companies. It will lead to more credit being extended to poor families. It will ensure that those families will file more bankruptcies. It will force these families to file different types of bankruptcies, the kind of bankruptcy that ensures that they will never be free of their debt and able to restart their lives. 
This is a complex issue and I must provide some background in order to explain my stance. There are two types of bankruptcies that individuals can file: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Under current law, individuals can choose either type. Chapter 7 bankruptcy allows debtors to discharge all their debt (besides child support, taxes, home loans, and student loans). Chapter 13 bankruptcies discharge no debt, but allow debtors to bargain directly with their creditors on reduced debt and payment schedules. Under the bill we passed today, Chapter 7 bankruptcies, which have provided a new start to millions of families over the years, will become a thing of the past. First of all, a judge now will have discretion to reject a debtor's Chapter 7 claim, and require her to file under Chapter 13, if it can be proven that the debtor has the ability to pay off 30% of her debt over the next five years. Secondly, any of the debtor's creditors can enter the court--without legal counsel--and require the court to make a judgement as to whether the debtor can afford this 30%. Thirdly, if the judge believes that the debtor can pay off this 30%, the debtor's attorney--and this is unheard of in the law to date--will be forced to pay the cost of the Chapter 13 Trustee. This is a hugely expensive tax on bankruptcy attorneys and they will certainly avoid taking on new Chapter 7 bankruptcies. 
The truth is that this bill treats all debtors as likely criminals. Yes, bankruptcies in this country are up. But debtors now wait longer to file bankruptcy and are deeper in debt than those who filed bankruptcy a decade ago. Furthermore, increased filings can be attributed to job loss, divorce, increasing health care costs, declining real wages--and most importantly--an entire industry of easy credit which ten years ago did not exist in any where near today's scale. 
Harvard Business School researchers David Moss and Gibbs Johnson state `the evidence suggests that shifts in the volume of and distribution of consumer credit--rather than declining stigma [of bankruptcies]--are the most likely sources of the recent surge in consumer filings.' They add that the surge of filings that began in the late 1980s can be attributed to `consumer creditors [which] began reaching substantially further down into the income distribution beginning in the mid 1980s.' It should also be noted that credit-card mail solicitations have skyrocketed, from 3.1 million mail solicitations in 1996 to over 881 million mail solicitations in 1997. Yet it is this consumer credit industry that benefits most from this bill; because it is this industry that will use this bill to prevent individuals from discharging their credit card debt. Simply put, this bill will increase the amount of money that credit card companies would receive from low-income bankrupt debtors. Meanwhile, opponents argue that sophisticated individuals with good legal advice will be able to get around the bill's new changes (as is often the case with financial laws). 
Who will benefit from this bill? I will quote Senator Metzenbaum, Public Citizen, and Consumers Union: `The only reason we're having this debate is because the credit industry, primarily the credit card industry, has spent well-orchestrated millions on ads and lobbyists demonizing American families in crisis.' Even the title of a Wall Street Journal article says it all: `As Bankruptcies Surge, Creditors Lobby Hard to Get Tougher Laws; But Whether Many People Shirk Bills They Can Pay Remains Open To Debate; Changing the Lender's Image.' I quote from that article: `As the legislation moves quickly through Congress, many academics, lawyers, and judges who specialize in bankruptcy question why. A government-appointed commission spent two years studying the matter and was deeply divided. Five of its nine members found no major abuse of the system or need for a crackdown: only two endorsed anything like the bills Congress is embracing. More than 100 jurists wrote lawmakers to urge them to slow down.* * * A major reason [for the bill]? A multi-million public-relations and lobbying blitz run largely by companies with the most to gain: credit card issuers and other lenders.' 
Who will suffer under this bill? When job loss, divorce, or medical emergency strike, some families have no choice but to file for bankruptcy in order to stabilize themselves. Divorced women file for bankruptcy in greater proportions than divorced men. Victims of abuse file for bankruptcy, often from debt incurred entirely by those who abused them. Single parents are forced into bankruptcy after any substantial period of unemployment. African Americans and Hispanics are dramatically over-represented in bankruptcy. With health insurance in its current state, families that suffer even one major medical emergency often find themselves in need of bankruptcy protection. But this bill responds to the need of these families by basically re-instituting life-long debtor's prison. All to the benefit of easy-credit companies. I could not in good conscience support this bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, in support of this amendment. 
Let me say to my colleagues on the other side--perhaps we can have some discussion and debate about this--that I find it very interesting what is going on here. If I am wrong, I am sure my colleagues will try to prove me wrong. I don't actually think they can prove me wrong. Here is what is going on. 
The reason that the vast majority of the people in our country have made it crystal clear that they are for an increase in the minimum wage, that they think to go from $5.15 cents and hour to $6.15 over a 2-year period is imminently reasonable is because they think this is a family-value issue. This occurred the last time we went through this debate and this time as well. Most people in Minnesota and most people in the United States of America believe that it is our responsibility as Senators and as Democrats and Republicans to create a climate whereby they can do their best by their kids, because when they do their best by their kids, they do their best by our country. One of the ways they can do best by their kids is to have a decent job and a decent wage so they can support their families. That is what this debate is all about. 
Mr. President, we have these arguments trotted out here. I do not like where they come from. We have the same old song. I understand that for a variety of different reasons some of my colleagues are opposed to raising the minimum wage. I understand this may be a difficult vote. So we have to figure out other arguments to make. I don't think it looks good. 
I am going to sort of break from the traditional boundaries of debate and say this: I don't think it looks good. 
In this past year we gave ourselves a cost of living raise of $1.50 an hour on top of giving ourselves, several years ago, a $30,000 increase. We in the Senate went from $100,000 to $130,000-plus. 
At the time, I had colleagues come up to me and say, `We need to do it. We have two places. We have children. They are in college. It is tough. It is very difficult to make ends meet.' So we voted ourselves a $30,000 increase, and then, on top of that, we vote ourselves a $1.50-an-hour cost of living increase. Yet, we say it is just outrageous to increase the minimum wage for people who are working full-time, playing by the rules of the game, 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, and are making poverty wages. People who work full-time ought not to be poor in America. They ought to be able to make a decent wage and support their children. $100,000 to $130,000 for us is fine, but to raise the minimum wage $1 over 2 years is not fine. 
That is a tough argument to make for people in the country, because most people in the country believe that it is our job to make sure that when people play by the rules of the game and work hard that they earn a decent living. Most people in this country believe that those people ought to have that chance. Thus, the arguments come out. 
And so we heard that we are going to lose all these jobs, but that didn't happen. Here are the figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I am not bringing out any particular conservative group or liberal group. I am just going by BLS data. When we went from $4.25 to $4.75 over this first year, 394,000 new jobs were added to the economy. Then when we went from $4.75 to $5.15, 517,000 new jobs were added to the economy. 
When I am finished I look forward to my colleagues refuting this; to just explain away the data. Sometimes we don't know what we don't want to know. But these are the facts from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Where is the evidence that this increase in the minimum wage that helped so many people in our country--10 million-plus people, 140,000 people in Minnesota, helped people do better by themselves and better by their kids--where is the evidence that it led to a decrease in jobs? 
In the State of Wyoming, since the Federal minimum wage was increased, unemployment in Wyoming dropped by 8 percent. Where is the evidence that the increases in the minimum wage lead to a sharp drop in the number of jobs in the State of Wyoming? It is just the opposite. According to BLS, 15 percent of the workforce in Wyoming will benefit from our increase--30,000 workers. 
So I don't understand this whole argument about how it will lead to a decrease in jobs. For reasons I can't understand, I think it is just sort of `blind ideology' that my colleagues don't want to support this. We are glad to have a big increase for ourselves. Then I say, `OK. What could be the reasons?' 
Here are the arguments that are brought out to the floor. One is we will see all of these jobs disappear. But precisely the opposite is happening. 
Until I hear to the contrary, I don't quite understand that argument. 
My colleague from Wyoming, who I enjoyed hearing, said we didn't have any hearings. The chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, my good friend, said we would be pleased to have hearings. 
So we don't have hearings. Hearings are denied and then that is used as an argument why we shouldn't take action. 
Then I hear my good friend from Utah make the argument that these jobs are not just about earnings. They are about learning, and that we should recognize the dignity of work. I agree. But do you want to know something? The best way that we can recognize the dignity of the work is to make sure there is some value to the work and make sure that these men and women who are taking care of our children, taking care of our parents, providing us with food, cleaning buildings, and you name it, are provided with a decent wage. 
A lot of people, no matter how hard they work, are poor because wages are too low. To talk to them about the dignity of their work and how this is great for learning just misses the point, if we won't talk about earnings. 
I don't know what reality we are dealing with here. We are dealing with the phenomenon of many working poor families in our country with the head of household working full-time, and those families are still poor. 
I am hearing colleagues talk about how we are opposed to raising the minimum wage because somehow we think it will undercut the dignity people have. Or we are opposed to raising the minimum wage because we really think this is as much about learning as it is earning. I just do not understand these arguments. 
Mr. President, we know that this especially helps women because they are disproportionately among the low-wage workers. We know that this disproportionately helps adults. We dealt with the mythology that this is all about teenagers. Then we get into the argument: But there are a percentage of these workers who are younger people, high school age, college age. 
Again, I don't know what reality my colleagues are focused on here. But do you know, they work for compelling reasons as well. In case anybody hasn't noticed, higher education is an expensive proposition. 
Many high school students and college students are working--I meet many college students who are working 2 and 3 minimum wage jobs. That is why it takes them 6 or 7 years to graduate. They are not doing it just on some lark. They are doing it because this is key to their being able to finance their education or help their parents finance their education. Or, if they are older--since many of the students are older and going back to school--it is even more critical. 
I heard my colleague from Utah refer to a study that showed when you have a higher minimum wage, welfare mothers stay on welfare a longer period of time. That does not make any sense to me. I would love to know what there is to that story. Because, frankly, if you are going to talk about the importance of going from welfare to workfare, presumably one of the key things you want to make sure of is that the jobs are there that pay a decent wage so those mothers and children will be better off. For some reason, States with higher minimum wage--or I guess the argument is supposed to be that by raising the minimum wage we have discouraged these parents from moving from welfare to work? It just makes no sense. I would love to know a little bit more about that finding. 
So, my conclusion--and I say this with some indignation--we just have all the sympathy in the world when we have oil companies coming out here asking for special breaks, but we have very little sympathy when it comes to these working poor families. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have not heard my colleague from Utah respond to this. I haven't heard one colleague on the other side of the aisle respond to the data or to the facts. I have heard them try to hide behind the argument that raising the minimum wage was going to lead to a loss of jobs. Since increasing the minimum wage in the prior year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 517,000 new jobs. Sometimes we do not want to know what we do not want to know. I have not heard any refutation of that at all. 
So my question is, Why in the world would we not value work and give dignity to work by raising the minimum wage, which is so important to women in the workplace, so important to children, so important to families? 
Then my colleague from Utah moves on to another argument concerning child care. In all due respect, that is what is so sad about this debate. If we really wanted to do our best by families and value families, we would be raising the minimum wage, we would be investing in affordable child care--which this Republican-led Senate will not do. We would have universal health care coverage, which this Republican-led Senate will not do. In child care, I hope the tradeoff is not to say that we are not going to be able to provide good child care for children unless we continue to devalue the work of men and women in child care. Many of them barely make minimum wage or barely above it. That is why we have a 40-percent turnover every year. This is not acceptable. 
We can raise the minimum wage, which is important for women, important for these working families, important for children, important for young people who are trying to work their way through school. We can invest in the health and skills and intellect and character by investing in affordable child care. We can invest in health care. This Republican-led Senate has done none of these things. 
In all due respect, in all due respect, the reason that 75 or 80 percent of the people in the country believe we should raise the minimum wage is because they have some sense of fairness and justice. We raised our salaries by $30,000 just a few years ago. We gave ourselves a cost-of-living increase that amounts to a $1.50 increase per hour, we make $130,000-plus and say we need to make that. And yet, we will not raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over a 2-year period so people who work hard will not be poor in America and their children will not be poor? This is really outrageous. 
I hope we get a majority vote.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, right now in our country there are about 10 million children--of course, when I talk about children, I am talking about their parents as well--who are eligible for good developmental child care opportunities. As it turns out, we provide assistance to 1.4 million out of this 10 million. In other words, fully 86 percent of children who are eligible to receive some assistance so that they will get better child care in those critical early years receive no assistance at all. 
I introduce today this piece of legislation, which I have called the Child Development Act. I have been working on it for the last year and a half. Altogether, over the next 5 years, it calls for $62 billion, about $12 billion--less than 1 percent of the budget--to be invested in the health, skills, intellect and character of our children. 
About $37.5 billion just increases funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program (CCDBG), which has been a proven success in providing more money so that we can expand child care in our States and provide help to many working families that need this help. 
In addition, the bill provides funding for improving afterschool programs. We have funds that are set aside to improve the quality of child care. Children Defense Fund studies have shown that six out of seven child care facilities in this country provide only poor-to-mediocre service, and one out of eight centers actually put children at risk. 
There is additional funding for professional training, for new construction, and I say to my colleagues, there is also funding for loan forgiveness, which is the effort that I have been working on with my colleague, Senator DeWine from Ohio, so that those men and women who do their undergraduate work and receive training in early childhood development, where the wages are so low, at least will receive loan forgiveness which will help them. Finally, there is some $13 billion in tax credits for low- and middle-income working parents to help them afford child care. 
Research has shown that much of what happens in life depends upon the first three years of development. The brain is so profoundly influenced during this time that the brain of a three-year-old has twice as many synapses (connections between brain cells) as that of her adult parents. The process of brain development is actually one of `pruning' out the synapses that one does not need (or more accurately, does not use) from those that become the brains standard `wiring.' This is why the first three years of development are so important--this is the time that the brain must develop the wiring that is going to be used for the rest of one's life. According to a report on brain development published by the Families and Work Institute, `Early care and nurture have a decisive, long lasting impact on how people develop, their ability to learn, and their capacity to control their own emotions.' If children do not receive proper care before the age of three, they never receive the chance to develop into fully functioning adults. 
We are not allowing our children a chance in life when we do not provide them with proper care in their early years. If America is to achieve its goal of equal opportunity for our children, we need to start with proper care in their early years. It is a painful statistic then that our youngest citizens are also some of the poorest Americans. One out of every four of our country's 12 million children under the age of three live in poverty. It becomes very difficult to break out of the cycle of poverty if poor children are not allowed to develop into fully functioning adults. 
Yet many parents in America do not have the option of providing adequate care for their children. For parents who can barely afford rent it is nearly impossible to take advantage of the Family Medical Leave Act, and sacrifice 12 weeks of pay in order to directly supervise a child. Many mothers need to return to work shortly after giving birth and find that the only options open to them are to place their children in care that is substandard, even potentially dangerous--but affordable. According to the Children's Defense Fund, six out of seven child care centers provide only poor to mediocre care, and one in eight centers provide care that could jeopardize children's safety and development. The same study said that one in three home-based care situations could be harmful to a child's development. How can we abide by these statistics? 
This is a serious problem, and frighteningly widespread. The eligibility levels set for receiving child care aid through the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) is 85 percent of a state's median income. Nationally, this comes out to about $35,000 for a family of three in 1998. However, according to the Children's defense fund, fully half of all families with young children earn less than $35,000 per year. Half! A family that has two parents working full time at minimum wage earns only $21,400 per year. This is not nearly enough to even dream of adequate child care. 
Child care costs in the United States for one child in full day care range from $4,000 to $10,000 a year. It is not surprising that, on average, families with incomes under $15,000 a year spend 23 percent of their annual incomes on child care. And in West Virginia, if a family of three makes more than that $15,000, they no longer qualify for child care aid! In fact, thirty-two states do not allow a family of three which earns $25,000 a year (approximately 185 percent of poverty) to qualify for help. Only four states in our nation set eligibility cut offs for receiving child care assistance at 85 percent of median family income, the maximum allowed by federal law. There is obviously not enough funding to support the huge need for child care assistance in our nation, and that is why I am proposing the Child Care Development Act. 
There is widespread support for expanded investments to improve the affordability and quality of child care. A recent survey of 550 police chiefs found that nine out of ten police chiefs surveyed agreed that `America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more in programs to help children and youth get a good start' such as Head Start and child care. Mayors across the country identified child care, more than any other issue, as one of the most pressing issues facing children and families in their communities in 1996 survey. A recent poll found that a bipartisan majority of those polled support increased investments in helping families pay for child care--specifically, 74% of those polled favor a bill to help low-income and middle-class families pay for child care, including 79% of Democrats, 69% of Republicans, and 76% of Independents. 
It is clear that many like to talk about supporting our children, and many are in favor of supporting our children, but what action is actually taken? Yes, the addition of new child care dollars in 1996 has helped welfare recipients, but it has done nothing for working, low-income families not receiving TANF. The Children's Defense Fund recommends that Congress pass comprehensive legislation that guarantees at least $20 billion over five years in new funding for the Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG). My Child Care Development Act goes beyond this, yet even my bill is just a first step. This bill is designed to provide affordable, quality child care to half of the ten million American children presently in need of subsidized care. It will provide $62.5 billion over 5 years--$12.5 billion a year--nearly three times the amount proposed in the President's most ambitious, and still unprosecuted, proposal. In 1997 the President proposed extending care to 600,000 children from poor families, leaving fully 80% of eligible children without aid. That was the last we heard of it. And it wasn't good enough, anyway. 
If we are serious about putting parents to work and protecting children, we need to invest more in families and in child care help for them. Enabling families to work and helping children thrive means giving states enough money so that they can set reasonable eligibility levels, let families know that help is available, and take working families off the waiting lists. 
The Child Care Development Act will require $62.5 billion over five years. There will be several offsets necessary if we are serious about giving children in this country the type of care they need and deserve. Shifting spending from these offsets demonstrates that our true national priority is children, not wasteful military spending and corporate tax loopholes. 
The offsets that will be necessary are as follows. If we repeal the reductions in the Corporate Minimum Tax from the 1997 Budget Bill, we create $8.2 billion. The elimination of the Special Oil and Gas Depletion Allowance will make room for and additional $4.3 billion. An offset of $.575 billion will come from a repeal of the Enhanced Oil Recovery Credit and an offset of $13.767 billion will come from the elimination of exclusion for Foreign-Earned Income. From these four different offsets in tax provisions a sub total amount of $26.835 is created to spend on child care. 
Defense Cuts will also be necessary in the amount of $24.4 billion. This will come from canceling the F-22, a plane plagued with troubles, which will free up $19.29 billion, and $5.11 billion will come from a reduction in Nuclear Delivery Systems Within Overall Limits of START II. 
The remaining offsets can be made by reducing the Intelligence Budget by 5 percent, which would save $6.675 billion; by reducing Military Export Subsidies by $.85 billion; and by canceling the International Space Station, which costs $10.045 billion. All of which, when added together, allows for an additional $68.805 billion to be used to support our children. 
This is, finally, a child care bill on the same scope as the problem itself. We as a nation are neglecting the most vulnerable and important portion of our society--our children. Here is an ambitious solution to this vast problem that has been plaguing our country. So that we don't have to be a country that just talks about putting our children first. 
Mr. President, I want to speak a little bit from the heart. We are now at a point in our session where we have maybe 2 1/2 , 3 weeks to go. I think it is a tragedy that, in many ways, we are not involved in the work of democracy. From my point of view as a Senator from Minnesota, the work of democracy is to try to respond and speak to the concerns and circumstances of people's lives. 
As I travel around Minnesota and travel around the country, I believe that, more than anything else, what families are saying to us is, `We want to do our very best by our kids, because if we as parents,' or a single parent, `can do our best by our kids, we will do our best by our country.' 
One of the reasons we--I am talking about the people now in the country--are so disillusioned about our political process, above and beyond all that they hear about every day, which I hate, is that all that is happening is no good for our country. I think the polls show this as well, people are saying, `Get on with your governing, too; please govern; please be relevant and important to our lives.' People feel like we are not doing that. 
I have to say that if we can respond to what most people are talking about, which is how we earn a decent living and how do we give our children the care we know they need and deserve, we will be doing well by people. If we can do everything that we can do as Senators, Democrats and Republicans, and if the private sector plays its role and we also engage in voluntarism and a lot of good things happen at the community level and non-Government organizations, and nonprofits play their role, and I say to Rabbi Shemtov, our guest chaplain today, the religious community needs to play their role: if we all do everything we can to enable parents or a parent to do their best by their kids, then that is the best single thing we can do. 
What saddens me and also angers me is that all of a sudden, the focus on children is just off the table. We have lost it. It wasn't that many months ago that we were having conferences and we were talking about reports that were coming out and we couldn't stop discussing the development of the brain; how important it is to make sure that we get it right for our children because by age 3, if we don't get it right for them, they are never going to be ready for school and never be ready for life. 
What happened? What happened to our focus? We have lost our focus. We have lost our way. We are talking a lot about values, and we are talking a lot about moral issues and we should--we should. But isn't it also a moral question or a moral issue that one out of every four children under the age of 3 is growing up poor in America today, and one out of every three children of color under the age of 3 is growing up poor in America today? 
With our economy still humming along, how can it be that we cannot do better? I don't understand that. I say to the Rabbi and Chaplain, in the words of Rabbi Hillel, `If not now, when?' 
Here we are with 3 weeks to go to this Congress, and we haven't done anything to help families, to help children, to fill their void so that we make sure that every child who comes to kindergarten comes to kindergarten ready to learn. If we are going to talk about education, and we are going to have a discussion about education--maybe we won't on the present 
course--I think we have to focus on the learning gap. 
The truth of the matter is, we do quite well for kids in our public schools if they come to kindergarten ready to learn. It is the kids who come to kindergarten not ready to learn for whom we don't do well. 
I am not trying to take K-12 off the hook. We need to do much better. But couldn't we say that as a national goal we want to make sure that every child who comes to kindergarten comes to kindergarten ready to learn? So that she knows the alphabet. He knows colors and shapes and sizes. She knows how to spell her name. They have been read to widely and they come with the readiness to learn. 
The Presiding Officer, Senator DeWine, is as committed to children as any Senator in the Senate. He knows what I am saying. 
This is a cost-neutral bill. I will not go on about this bill's offsets. I cut into some tax loopholes and some subsidies that go to some of the largest corporations in America that do not need it. I raise some questions about whether we need some additional missiles and additional bombers. I redefine national security, and say, yes, we need a strong defense, but we need to take some of the money and invest for children. People can agree or disagree about where I get the money for this. Can't we agree that we take 1 percent of our budget and invest it in the health and skills and character and intellect of our children? They are 100 percent of our future. 
I must repeat this point. I cannot believe that not that many months ago we were all talking about development of the brain, early childhood development. We were all talking about legislation--we were all talking about how we were going to do something to help parents do better by their kids, and we are not doing that. 
That is why I introduce this legislation today. I do not think it is a cry in the wilderness, because I hope next year we are going to get this bill enacted. I am going to fight for this. And maybe, if I have a chance--I don't know that I will, given the next 3 weeks--I will bring some of it up as amendments. But we have to start speaking out about this, Mr. President. I say to Senator DeWine, the Presiding Officer, we have to start speaking out about this because we should be doing better.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Boxer amendment would simply let the Interior Department do its job, which is making sure that oil companies pay full royalties for the oil they are drilling on Federal or Indian lands. That is what this amendment does. 
Right now, some of these companies are not paying the money that they owe, and several are being sued for it. Amazingly, there is a rider in this bill, the same rider put in during the conference committee on this spring s supplemental appropriations bill, that stops Interior from doing its job. That is what this is about. This rider stops Interior from issuing rules to collect these royalties. No wonder Senator Boxer has sounded the alarm. 
As a Senator from Minnesota, I am glad that we have Senators who are willing to stand up to oil companies. There are not that many Senators who will do so. The Senator from California has the courage to do so. 
This kind of sweetheart deal--and that is exactly what it is--is simply outrageous. It is corporate welfare of the worst kind. And even worse, in many cases this money is being taken away from our children's schools. In 24 States, the State's share of the royalties is used to fund public education, so when the oil companies underpay their royalties, education is the loser. 
In addition, the Federal share of these royalties goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the National Historic Preservation Fund. 
If the Boxer amendment is adopted, the money will go where it should be going--to public education, the environment, historic preservation, and to Native American communities--instead of corporate bank accounts. 
Mr. President, this is an unbelievable story. The Interior Department's Mineral Management Service--MMS--simply wants to collect the money these companies owe the public. Interior Secretary Babbitt says:  
Many of the industry's largest companies are underpaying royalties. 
Just recently, Mobil Oil agreed to a $56.5 million settlement of Federal and State lawsuits alleging underpayment of royalties. That is what has been going on. And there has been a flurry of such settlements: $2.5 billion in Alaska, $350 million in California, $17.5 million in Texas, $10 million in Louisiana, and $8 million in New Mexico. MMS has now billed 12 of these companies $260 million for overdue royalties. Now the Justice Department has joined a lawsuit under the False Claims Act alleging fraud. According to Justice, several of these oil companies have been deliberately underpaying their royalties. 
Remember, this oil belongs to the public and to Native American tribes. We are leasing the mineral rights to them, but only under one condition. We are saying, `Go ahead, take the oil; all we ask is a 12.5 percent cut on the fair market value.' I don't think that is too much to ask. Nor do the people of this country think it is too much to ask. But apparently the oil companies do. 
Let me be clear about one thing. This has already come up in the debate. Senator Durbin spoke to it, and Senator Boxer spoke to it as well. We are not talking about all the oil companies. We are not talking about mom-and-pop independents. We are talking about the large integrated companies who sell to affiliates at undervalued prices. They make up only 5 percent of all the oil companies drilling on Federal land, but they account for 68 percent of all Federal production. 
For over 2 years, the Interior Department has been developing regulations to put a stop to this highway robbery. This is not new authority. Interior already has statutory authority to collect royalties on the `fair market value' of this oil, but the new regulations would keep oil companies from manipulating `fair market value' to underpay their royalties. The oil companies don't like that. 
Here is the question I ask colleagues: Do these companies, do these huge integrated oil companies, really deserve our sympathy? I don't think so. They have been caught--let me repeat that--they have been caught underpaying their royalties. 
Since when do we have such tremendous sympathy in the U.S. Senate for people who are cheating the public? It is interesting to me. We pass crime bills all the time. Now we have the Juvenile Justice Act--a crackdown on children. Very little sympathy there. Put children in adult corrections facilities; very little sympathy for these children. 
We passed a welfare bill. We don't really know what is happening. We know women have been taken off the welfare rolls. We know the children have been taken off the rolls. But we don't know what kind of jobs they have, what kind of wages. We don't know whether there is good child care for those children. Very little sympathy for these families either. 
We tried to bring an amendment to the floor to increase the minimum wage so that working people can make a decent living. There is very little sympathy on the floor of the Senate for any of these folks. 
But in through the door walks a CEO from one of these oil companies--large integrated oil companies that have been underpaying their royalties, oil companies who happen to be heavy campaign contributors--and all of a sudden we have sympathy to spare. We have sympathy coming out the wazoo. We feel their pain. All of a sudden it is, `At your service, sir. What can we do for you, sir? How can we serve you better?' 
These companies have been caught red-handed. The cops are after them. Law enforcement is closing in. They are in deep trouble, and they are desperate for someone to come to their rescue, and fast. 
So who do they call? They call their friends. They call the U.S. Congress. And guess what. Congress answers the call without a moment's hesitation. With a rider in this bill, Congress comes to the rescue and rewards them with a `get out of jail free' card. 
The Boxer amendment would revoke this sweetheart deal that lets oil companies keep ripping off the public, lets them keep shortchanging education, even after they have been caught cheating. If there ever was a time to be tough on crime, this is it. In fact, I say this is a time for zero tolerance. The rider in this bill sends law enforcement on paid holiday. The Boxer amendment puts the cops back on the beat. 
I say to my colleagues, we have to ask ourselves a question: What is our purpose here? Are we elected to fight for people or for the oil companies? Were we elected to fight for good government or for corporate welfare? Are we going to do what the public wants us to do, or are we going to do what the oil companies want us to do? 
I urge my colleagues to join in a broad coalition that opposes this $66 million corporate welfare giveaway. That is what this amendment speaks to. That is what this debate is all about, and all of us will be held accountable. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to express my outrage at threats toward Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi made Tuesday in the government-controlled press in Rangoon. Completely without justification the press called for Aung San Suu Kyi to be deported from Burma. The regime has again made the ridiculous charge that Aung San Suu Kyi is not entitled to Burmese citizenship. This charge is made on the xenophobic and insulting basis that she married a foreigner. The regime has long tried to discredit Aung San Suu Kyi with the Burmese people with this type of nonsense--it hasn't worked. 
The Burmese people voted for Aung San Suu Kyi's party overwhelmingly in 1990--electing opposition candidates to 80 percent of the parliament seats. She remains the hope of a repressed people longing for democracy and human rights. The military regime, which used to call itself the SLORC, has tried to improve its image by changing its name to the State Peace and development Council. But it is the same regime. It has had to prevent Aung San Suu Kyi from speaking publicly because she was drawing huge crowds to the front of her home. It has had to prevent her from traveling freely to visit her supporters since they fear her popularity. 
Far from being a foreigner, Aung San Suu Kyi embodies the very history of Burma. She is the daughter of the founder of the Burmese army and the leader of Burma's independence movement, General Aung San. Like her father, Aung San Suu Kyi has devoted years of her life to the Burmese people at great personal sacrifice. 
The Burmese people strongly identify Aung San Suu Kyi with her father's legacy and his struggle to bring independence and ethnic unity to Burma. In fact, displaying pictures of General Aung San has become a symbolic act of defiance and show of support for the opposition. University students began demonstrations in 1996 and again in 1998 by displaying portraits of Aung San as a rallying signal. The authorities can't take action against those displaying his picture since he is also revered by the regime as the nation's founder. 
The regime rightly fears the power of these symbols but their attempts to separate Aung San Suu Kyi from her legacy and deprive her of citizenship will fail. The Burmese people see through it. The people clearly do not want her deported. 
I urge the regime to treat this courageous woman with the respect she deserves and to ensure that no harm comes to her. She has stood up to the repressive tactics of the military regime for over 10 years now. In recent months, she has sacrificed her personal comfort and risked her health facing down the authorities. When denied the ability to travel freely she spent 10 days waiting in her car for the authorities to allow her to move. Her exceptional fortitude and her commitment to challenging the regime through non-violent actions are an inspiration to those working for human rights around the world. 
I also express my concern about recent detentions of several hundred of Aung San Suu Kyi's supporters. Last week, the regime reacted with typically heavy-handed tactics to prevent her party from convening the members of parliament elected in free and fair elections held in 1990. The regime has never allowed the parliament elected in 1990 to take office because the voters overwhelmingly elected opposition members. Aung San Suu Kyi recently called on the regime to convene the parliament. When that request was ignored her party decided to convene a `People's Parliament' on its own. The reaction of the military junta was predictable. They simply rounded up any opposition politician who might attend the planned events and `detained' them. Hundreds of party members are still being held. 
This outrageous tactic violates the rights of the Burmese people to exercise freedom of assembly and political expression. Although this behavior is nothing new or unexpected for this repressive regime we must persist in condemning it. I call on the regime to immediately release all opposition party members detained and to enter into genuine dialogue with the opposition and ethnic minority group about restoring democracy to Burma. 
And, again, I call on the military regime to treat Aung San Suu Kyi with respect as the legitimate leader of the opposition and to withdraw the threat of deportation and respect her rights as a Burmese citizen. 
To reiterate, Mr. President, I want to go on record. I express my outrage, and I think it is outrage of Democrats and Republicans, at the threats toward the Burmese opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, made last Tuesday by a Government-controlled press. They are now talking about the possibility of deporting her from Burma. 
She is a very, very courageous woman. The people overwhelmingly elected her in 1990. What has happened since is that this military regime, which used to call itself SLORC, which has now tried to improve its image by calling itself the State Peace and Development Council, has been just full of brutal repression for the people there. 
I rise to express my concern about what is happening to this very courageous woman who has been trying to travel, has been trying to have an opportunity to speak out in her country and meet with other people. She spent recently 10 days just in her car trying to cross a bridge to meet with people, to speak with people in her own country. This regime really has her under house arrest. 
In addition, this past week, what happened is that many of the people in her party decided that they would convene a people's parliament, since their elections were nullified when this repressive military government took over. They held a meeting, and hundreds of them have been rounded up and are now in prison. 
I come to the floor of the Senate today to simply say that this is an outrageous practice of repression by this Government. I condemn it on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is not always that I think I speak for almost every single Senator, but I believe Democrats and Republicans agree on this. I call on this military regime to treat this courageous woman with respect as a legitimate leader of the opposition and to release people whom they have unlawfully put in jail. 
Aung San Suu Kyi is a courageous woman. She stands for the very best of what our country stands for, which is respect for human rights and democracy. We need to speak out on the floor of the Senate, and we need to send a message to this repressive Government in Burma, that not only will we not do business with you as usual--and we are not doing that--but we, as a Government, we as the U.S. Senate, will continue to speak out and condemn your actions, and we will continue to support people in Burma, those people who stand up for democracy and stand up for human rights. 
I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-2-19980914</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. I thank the Chair. I guess it is an indirect question for other colleagues as well. I put it in the form of a question to my colleague from Iowa. 
While I understand the need for some sort of time agreement, does not the Senator from Iowa agree with me that we have an economic convulsion in agriculture right now and this is an issue of central importance to many Senators from the Midwest? I ask my colleague from Iowa if he thinks, in all due respect to the majority leader, that we are marginalizing or trivializing this issue by saying that it is going to be tabled at 5 o'clock? Some Senators may not even be back here--not just Senator Daschle from South Dakota--without the opportunity to speak about this issue. 
Does my colleague think maybe it is a mistake not to allow other Senators to speak on this? This is not a small issue--am I correct?--in our States. Doesn't this issue deserve the full attention of the Senate or full opportunity for a full debate? And does my colleague not have some concern that by having a tabling motion sometime around 5, that a good many Senators are not going to be able to speak on this question, this urgent question?

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. And I will let my colleague go on with his presentation. I know there are a number of Senators who want to speak, myself included. 
I ask the Senator from Iowa this question, again, making the appeal to the majority leader: Doesn't this also go to the heart of accountability? Isn't it true people in Iowa, Minnesota, the Dakotas, throughout the Midwest, and, for that matter, throughout the country as well--let me focus on our States--as my colleague from Iowa thinks about it, don't people back in our States have the right to know where we stand? Don't they have a right to know whether or not their Senators have been out here on the floor making proposals--positive proposals--about what could be done that speaks to their economic pain one way or the other? Doesn't this whole issue before us speak to the issue of accountability? 
If we have a tabling motion at 5 or 5:30, albeit the minority leader absolutely has to speak, doesn't this take away from the very idea of accountability, where people will wonder, where were our Senators, why didn't they speak up for us, or why didn't they have other alternatives if they didn't like this amendment? Don't we really undercut the very notion of accountability and what we are about by rushing to a tabling motion on such an urgent matter, such a central issue, something that is so important to people in our States? 
I feel some indignation about this. This is not the way to proceed. For me, this is the issue. What is happening in Minnesota in agriculture is the issue. I just don't see a couple of hours, table, goodbye, that's it, one way or the other.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, and also Senator Harkin from Iowa. 
I think that it is not just a matter of--I think my colleague, Senator Dorgan, will agree with me--of coming to the floor and giving a speech. 
This is all so real to us. It is very concrete. This is the issue.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota is right. This gathering is not a gathering just for farmers, but it is also for small businesses, for educators, for the religious community. It is really for rural America, farmers and other citizens from the Dakotas, from Iowa, from Minnesota. It is going to be 9:30 to noon at the Nobles County Fairground grandstand. And I also say to my colleague from North Dakota, it is very important to point out to the presiding Chair and others that Republicans are invited to be a part of this gathering. This is going to be a bipartisan effort to focus the attention of the Nation on what is happening in agriculture. So it is a very, very important gathering. I think there will be a huge turnout of people, and I hope that those of us who represent the Midwest, Democrats and Republicans alike, will be there. 
Mr. President, I want to read the beginning of the letter that Wally Sparby sent to me. Again, he is the director of the Minnesota State office of the USDA Farm Service Agency. 
Senator Wellstone: 
During our 1998 loan season, we approved loans based on $4 per bushel for wheat and $2.55 to $2.75 for corn. Now that farmers are receiving from $2.50 to $2.70 for their wheat in the marketplace and $1.42 to $1.52 per bushel for their corn, it just does not sustain cash flow. 
And among the recommendations, the first recommendation is: 
The one thing Congress can do that will help farmers with cash flow today more than anything else is to take the caps off loan rates.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my good friend--he is a good friend--Senator Hutchinson, I have looked through the language, and under the section dealing with protection of employer rights--maybe there should be another time my colleague should bring this bill to the floor because this bill, in its present form, would allow an employer not to hire someone who might simply have an interest in joining a union. It is that ambiguous. 
I say to my colleague that while this isn't his intention, it sort of reminds me--you cannot have such broad language. It is sort of like the days a long time ago--it is not the intention of my colleague from Arkansas; and I think my colleague from Massachusetts would appreciate this--where the Irish had a hard time getting jobs because people assumed, `They might very well come in there and organize a union.' We cannot go back to those days. 
Or as I look at this piece of legislation, you have a situation where maybe an employer would not hire a minority for fear that that minority, based upon her past experience, might come into the workplace and say to other people, `Listen. We're not getting a fair shake.' Or the same thing can hold true with someone who has been active in the National Organization for Women, and the argument might be, `We don't want to hire such a person because, again, they might engage in the kind of activity that we would prohibit.' 
Or you might get into a situation where you do not want to hire someone--I think we have had that discussion before--who might come in and, because of her background--she is an activist--`My gosh, she might come in and start organizing with other women and say, `You know what? We ought to be going to our employer and saying this ought to be a more family-friendly workplace. We need good child care here.' 
This is a piece of legislation which is so broad in its application and so ambiguous, I say to my friend from Arkansas, that this is an enormous step backward. 
I only have a few minutes, and if I get more time we can go to debate, but I just want to simply say that I think the direction we ought to go in--because the truth about this Truth in Employment Act is that it just takes us back decades. It is unacceptable. 
I have a piece of legislation that I have introduced called the Fair Labor Organizing Act. Let us talk about, What is the truth when it comes to the imbalance of power between employers and employees right now? If there is going to be a focus on how parents or a parent can do their best by their kids--in which case, they do their best by our country--then part of the focus is going to be on living-wage jobs. That speaks to the right of people to organize and bargain collectively, to earn a decent living, and give their children the care they know their children need and deserve. This piece of legislation goes exactly in the opposite direction. 
Now, the Fair Labor Organizing Act--and I would love to have support from my colleague on this--says three or four things. It says, first of all, let us talk about what is going on, the reality, the truth of what is going on right now. It says, first of all, that when it comes to organizing, companies do not get to give captive-audience speeches; the employees, the workers, also are going to have a right to hear someone from the union. 
Free flow of information. 
The second thing it says is that companies--let's talk about the truth. The truth is that, right now, there are too many companies that hire union-busting consultants and illegally fire people. Some 10,000 people a year are illegally fired because they want to do nothing more than join a union, have some power, bargain for a decent wage and do well for their families. What the Fair Labor Organizing Act, which I have introduced, says is that if a company does that, it is not going to be profitable for them to do that any longer. They are going to pay serious back pay. There are going to be serious fines on them. 
The third thing we say in this legislation is that even if people are lucky enough to be able to organize a union and aren't fired while they are trying to do so, then all too often companies just stonewall and refuse to sign a contract, in which case they will go to binding arbitration, mediation. 
I say to my colleague from Arkansas that if, in fact, we want to talk about truth in employment, then we ought to deal with the truth of the matter, which is right now we have egregious examples of people being illegally fired, not able to organize, not able to bargain collectively, and this legislation goes in exactly the opposite direction. 
This has very little to do with truth in employment. This has a whole lot to do with basic first amendment rights. This has a whole lot to do with giving those companies--I hope there are not too many, and I don't think there are; unfortunately, there are more than I wish there would be--a huge loophole whereby they simply don't have to hire somebody who potentially might have an interest to join a union, or she calls on her colleagues to join a union. It is unacceptable. You can't have a piece of legislation passed with this kind of mandate. We can't give companies a mandate not to hire women, not to hire minorities, not to hire activists who might want to join a union or want other members to join a union, not to hire men or women who want to fight for more child care. That is what this legislation does. Bring back another piece of legislation which doesn't have this kind of language and I will support it. But tonight I come to the floor to say to my colleagues that there should be an overwhelming vote against this piece of legislation. 
How much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I had a chance to speak yesterday for about half an hour, so let me summarize this way: 
First of all, I thank Senator Feingold who I think has just emerged, really, as a leading reformer before the U.S. Senate for his work, along with Senator McCain. This is a bipartisan effort, and I, frankly, think it speaks to the core issue. 
What I tried to say yesterday on the floor of the Senate is that as I think about a whole range of questions, over and over and over again, I come back to the fact that too few people have way too much wealth, power, and say, and too many people are just locked out. The polls show people want to have faith in our political process, people want to believe in what we are doing, but the conclusion that many people have reached is that if you pay, you play, and if you don't pay, you don't play, and that, basically, the same investors pretty much control both political parties; they control the political process. 
So many people in Minnesota and across the country have reached the conclusion that when it comes to their concerns about themselves and about their families and about their neighbors and about their communities, that their concerns are of little concern here in the corridors of power. 
I can't think of a better thing for us to do than to pass this piece of legislation. The Shays-Meehan bill passed in the House of Representatives. That was a very important victory. We now have an important vote on the floor of the Senate. There is an effort on the part of those who are opposed to reform to block this. That is what this is all about. We have a majority support on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I hope that other Senators will step forward and support this important piece of legislation, this important amendment offered by Senator McCain and Senator Feingold. 
As a Senator from Minnesota, a good government State, a progressive State, a State that cares about clean money and clean elections, a State that believes integrity in the political process is the most important thing that we can focus on, this piece of legislation, this amendment is the most important amendment that we will be voting on during this Senate. 
I hope my colleagues will vote to end this filibuster and support this legislation.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say that as we go into this debate--and I am pleased to be joined with Senator Kennedy; I have spoken about the importance of raising the minimum wage--I look forward to having the opportunity to debate this with colleagues. 
I guess I have reached the conclusion--I think this is sort of the common ground with the Chair--that the best single thing we can do in the Congress, in the House and the Senate, is to do everything we can to enable parents to do the best by their kids, or a single parent to do her or his best by children. I really do believe that this means many different kinds of things. But one of them certainly is to try to make sure that people have a living wage. I think it is terribly important. 
I think it is a value question. I look forward to the debate. I will be out on the floor with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, and others as well.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment, or for a little while here, about what is happening in the Midwest. I had thought that perhaps this afternoon I would have an opportunity as a Senator from Minnesota to join my colleagues from other Midwestern States with an amendment that would speak to the crisis in agriculture. That didn't happen this afternoon. 
For those who are watching this debate, now that there is an attempt to work out an agreement on this bankruptcy bill with a potential cloture vote tomorrow, it doesn't look like we will be able to introduce this amendment, at least today. But I do want to just say to colleagues--I know that a number of us will be on the floor tomorrow--that my top priority as a Senator from Minnesota is to bring to the floor of the Senate, with other colleagues, an amendment that would really make a difference in the lives of family farmers in my State. 
Mr. President, we have an economic convulsion in agriculture. There is tremendous economic pain in our rural communities. 
Many farmers and their families are just leaving their farms now. They are doing it quietly. It is not so much like the mid-1980s where you really saw a lot of farm rallies and marches and whatnot. That may happen. That may not happen. I don't know. 
I know that when I go to farm gatherings--whether it be in Fulda, MN, or in Granite Falls, MN, or Crookston, MN, it is quite unbelievable with the number of people that come. 
The fact of the matter is that with farmers now receiving somewhere like $1.42 for a bushel of corn, there is just simply no way--or $2.15 for a bushel of wheat--they can't cash-flow. 
My friend, the Presiding Officer, is from the State of Indiana. And he knows something about this issue. 
You can be the best manager in the world. You can't make it. If you are not a huge conglomerate, then you have more of a family farm operation, which really ranges in terms of numbers of acres of land. But the important part of it is that it is entrepreneurship. The people that work the land live there. These are the people that are in the most trouble. 
For those of us who are from the Midwest--in a way, I approach this debate with a sense of history, because I think in many ways this is sort of one of the last regions of the country where you have a family farm structure in agriculture. 
Mr. President, what I want to say to colleagues, understanding full well that we will not be able to do this on the bankruptcy bill, though I must say to my colleague from Iowa, a very good friend, that there is unfortunately a very direct correlation between what is happening, as he well knows, to family farms in our State and bankruptcy. 
If we can't do this amendment that will speak to the farm crisis on the bankruptcy bill, then the very next vehicle that comes to the floor--the very next bill--we absolutely have to have an amendment out here. 
We may have some different views about what needs to happen. But I will tell you that the amendment that I see which must be brought to the floor first and foremost is we are going to have to remove the caps on the market assistance loans. We can do other things as well and allow a 6-month loan extension. Corn right now is capped at $1.89 a bushel. This would get it up to $2.00, $2.20, $2.25. Wheat is capped at $2.58. This would get it up to $3.20. This would be the single most important thing we can do, along with providing indemnity payments that we have all been talking about. 
We passed this before we went on recess. It is going to have to be more by way of financial assistance, given what is happening to a lot of farmers in the South as well, because of weather conditions. And in our State, in northwest Minnesota, it is also scab disease. But we have to do those two things. 
Mr. President, I want to say to colleagues that I don't feel like time is neutral. In many ways, I feel like as a Senator from Minnesota that I am confronted with the urgency of now. I am trying to say to myself, `You are here as a Senator. What is the best thing you can do?' 
We have a bankruptcy bill. We can't put this amendment on the bankruptcy bill. But the next bill that comes to the floor next week, or the end of this week, we are going to be out here with an amendment that speaks directly to this farm crisis. We have to. It would be like not being a Senator from your State not to do this. 
I think every Senator on this floor, Democrat and Republican, understands this. I hope that we will have this amendment in the Chamber no later than the beginning of next week, if not tomorrow, although I am not quite sure how we are going to proceed on this bankruptcy bill. And if not that, there will come a point in time where probably the best thing I can do, if we are completely shut out--and I hope this won't happen--will be to come to the floor and filibuster, just basically stop everything. 
I don't think that will happen, but there is no way, there is no possible way, that I can go back home to the State of Minnesota and look in the eyes of a lot of people I really love and believe in without having made an all-out fight. We have only, what, 3 weeks left. 
So my appeal to colleagues is, look, it is getting hard to find the time to do some of what we think are our priorities. I wanted to see us out on the floor with this amendment today. That is not going to be possible as we try to work out something on the bankruptcy bill. 
It is a bitter irony for me to see `bankruptcy bill.' My gosh, that is what is happening in my State. That is what is happening all across greater Minnesota right now. People cannot make it. We cannot do the amendment on the bankruptcy bill. But whatever the next bill is, I guess at the beginning of next week we will have this amendment out here. I know how strongly Senator Daschle from South Dakota feels about this. This is his State, agriculture. There are other Senators from the Midwest who believe just as strongly, Democrats and Republicans. 
But I just want to say to Minnesota and to my colleagues, there is no way in the world that I can see us adjourning without taking action. There is just no way. It would be just impossible to go back into greater Minnesota to meet with people in communities and say, `Well, we had too busy a schedule. It was too difficult to find a `vehicle'.' No one knows what you are talking about--vehicles. I said it 5 minutes ago: `We are looking for a vehicle.' No one knows what that means. But just to try to say to people in Minnesota, `We only had a few weeks, and there was too busy a schedule; there were many important appropriation bills that we had to pass; there was no way to find the time,' people would say, `Aren't we a priority?' They would say, `Paul, aren't we a priority?--$1.40 for a bushel of corn, $2.50, $2.60 for a bushel of wheat. What about us? What about our children? What about our families? What about our communities?' 
So, again, move the caps on the market assisted loans and allow a 6-month extension. You have to get the price up. It is price, price, price. There is no substitute for getting the price up. If we can debate this, I don't even want to have an acrimonious debate. Those who thought that the Freedom to Farm --which I always called the `Freedom to Fail'--bill was an important piece of legislation, call it a modification, just a modification. We still have a loan rate. We just cap it at a very low level. Call it part of what we do by way of disaster relief, by way of emergency assistance, because this is an emergency. This is a disaster. The record low prices are a disaster. It is an emergency because people are not going to be able to continue to stay on their farms. 
What people are asking for in Minnesota, in my State, is not anything more than a fair shake. They are just saying give us an opportunity to have a decent price in the marketplace. 
Let me tell you, the grain companies will do just fine, but these family farmers will not. This `Freedom to Fail' bill has been a disaster in and of itself. We have to at least come back and have some kind of modification, some kind of safety net, some kind of way that farmers can get a better price. We also have to make sure that we get these indemnity payments out to people. People need the cash assistance so they can keep going. 
Mr. President, those are the two major provisions. There will be other provisions as well in an amendment we will bring to the floor, but I cannot see any way to postpone action on an agriculture farm crisis relief amendment any longer. 
We have been talking about this. Everybody is trying to figure out what are going to be the electoral connections, how is this going to fit into the elections, and so on and so forth. I will tell you, I think those of us from these States don't feel that way; we have to get something done. I do not think any proposal is credible unless you can get the price up. It all starts with getting the price up for family farmers. 
There is a whole lot going on in Washington right now, I guess. None of it should make anybody here, regardless of party, all that happy or all that pleased. But I can say without any exaggeration whatsoever, believe it or not, that in Fulda, MN, or Granite Falls, MN, or Crookston, MN, or in all sorts of communities in Minnesota where a lot of wonderful people who work so hard live, for them the focus is on being able to stay on their farm. 
The focus is whether or not the Senate and the House of Representatives are going to respond to their pain, whether or not we are going to provide them with some relief, whether or not we are going to do anything about this crisis. It cannot be done in Indiana or Minnesota at the State level. You cannot affect price at the State level. You could put together at the State level some different credit relief packages and all the rest, but you cannot affect the price. You have to remove the cap on the loan rate. You have to get the price up. You have to give these people a chance to get a decent price in the marketplace. You have to do that. First and foremost, you have to do that. We cannot wait any longer. 
So I don't know whether my words tonight are so much sort of talking about substantively what any number of us are going to bring out as an amendment--there are a lot of my colleagues in the Midwest I know who are going to be out here with this amendment led by Senator Daschle--or whether what I am trying to say is, look, I don't want to have people angry at me next week or the week afterwards, but I tell you, if we don't get an opportunity to put this amendment on a piece of legislation, then I am just going to come out here and talk for hours and hours and hours. I will just start talking about families, and I will start translating this into terms. I have done it before on the floor of the Senate. 
There is no issue I feel more strongly about. I don't really care how much is swirling around Washington, DC, and all the other stuff that people are going to be talking about, all of which I know has to be discussed and talked about, I guess, up to a point, although I think it ought to be proved. I think ultimately we are all going to have to make some decision about this, so we ought to wait and see what the facts are. 
But I tell you, right now, for me, this is the issue. This is the issue for a lot of people all across Minnesota. And I am not just saying it to give a speech. It is just true. They do not have any future for themselves and their families unless we take some action. We are going to have to do that. I feel stymied that we cannot do it on the bankruptcy bill. It seems that there is a very logical connection to record low farm prices and bankruptcy. But if not this bill, if not tonight, if not Friday, then next week we will bring this amendment to the floor and we will have a debate and we are going to pass a farm crisis relief amendment. And then we are going to get it through the House. And the House and the Senate are going to agree, and there is going to be credible, substantive farm crisis relief legislation that will make a difference. 
If we keep getting shut out and there is just no way to do it by way of bills, then I am just going to come out and filibuster. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues. I thank Senator Levin for his remarks. I thank him for his unbelievable dedication in trying to push through reform legislation. He has been at this a long time. This is the time to do it; I agree with my colleague. We have an opportunity. We have a bill that was passed on the House side. It is a bipartisan measure. We have a public that is calling for the change. And I agree with you, I say to the Senator; now is the time to pass this legislation. 
I also thank my colleagues, Senator McCain, Republican from Arizona, and Senator Feingold, Democrat from Wisconsin. I have a special kind of affection for both of my colleagues. I think Senator McCain is principled; he speaks out for what he believes in; he is a courageous legislator. I think Senator Feingold has emerged here in the U.S. Senate as a leading reformer. He is my neighbor. I am a Senator from Minnesota, and I tell you, people from Minnesota who follow Russ Feingold's work have a tremendous amount of respect for him. I am honored to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
I do not know exactly where to get started. It is interesting. Senator Barry Goldwater told it like it is. I went to Senator Goldwater's service in Arizona, not because I was necessarily in agreement with him on all the issues. As a matter of fact, some of my good friends, Republican colleagues, who were on the plane with me kept giving me Barry Goldwater's book `Conscience of a Conservative' and kept telling me if I had read that book when I was 15 I would be going down the right path. I told them I did read the book when I was 15. I just reached different conclusions. 
Senator Goldwater about a decade ago said: 
The fact that liberty depended on honest elections was of the utmost importance to the patriots who founded our nation and wrote the Constitution. They knew that corruption destroyed the prime requisite of constitutional liberty, an independent legislature free from any influence other than that of the people. Applying these principles to modern times, we can make the following conclusions. To be successful, representative government assumes that elections will be controlled by the citizenry at large, not by those who give the most money. Electors must believe their vote counts. Elected officials must owe their allegiance to the people, not to their own wealth or to the wealth of interest groups who speak only for the selfish fringes of the whole community. 
Let me just start out with some examples. I was involved in a debate here on the floor of the Senate last week which was emotional. It was kind of heart rending. You had a small group of people who were sitting where some of our citizens are sitting today. And they were from Sierra Blanca. They were disproportionately poor. They were Hispanic. And you know what? They were saying, `How come when it comes to the question of where a nuclear waste dump site goes, it's put in our community? How come it always seems to be the case that when we figure out what to do with these incinerators or where to put these power lines or where to dump this waste, it almost always goes to the communities where people don't make the big contributions? They are not the heavy hitters. They are disproportionately poor, disproportionately communities of color; thus, the question of 
environmental justice. 
This was a debate where you had the interests of big money, big contributors, corporate utilities, versus low-income minority communities. I would argue different colleagues voted for different reasons, and some voted because it was not their State and they felt a certain kind of, if you will, deference to Senators from other States. I understand that. But my point is a little different. 
I tell you that all too often the conclusion is sort of predetermined. Those who have the clout and those who make the big contributions are the ones who have the influence, and those are the ones we listen to. All too often, a whole lot of citizens--in this particular case, the people from Sierra Blanca--are not listened to at all. Big money prevails, special interests prevail, for the same reason that the people in Sierra Blanca cannot get a fair shake in Texas. That is to say, they do not give the big contributions, they do not have the political clout. For the same reason, they could not get a fair shake here in the U.S. Senate. 
In about 20 minutes I am going to be at a meeting with some colleagues from the Midwest. We have an economic convulsion in agriculture. Let me wear my political scientist hat. I really believe that when people look back to 1998, 1999, going into the next century, and raise questions about our economy--because I fear that we are going to be faced with some very difficult times--they are going to be looking at this crisis in agriculture as a sort of precursor. 
What has happened in agriculture is record low prices. Not everybody who is watching the debate comes from a State where agriculture is as important as it is in the State of Minnesota, the State I come from. But let me say to people who are listening to the debate, if you are a corn grower and you are getting $1.40 for a bushel of corn, you can be the best manager in the world, you can work from 5 in the morning until midnight, but you and your family will never make it. You will never make it. Record low prices. People are having to give up. They are just leaving. The farm is not only where they work, it is where they live. 
It is interesting that we had a farm bill, the 1996 farm bill. It was called the Freedom to Farm bill. I called it then the `freedom to fail' bill. It was a great bill--I am not saying anything on the floor of the Senate that I have not said a million times over in the last 2 years. It was a great bill for the grain companies because what this piece of legislation essentially said to family farmers is, `We're no longer going to give you a loan rate. We're going to cap the loan rate at such a low level that you won't have the bargaining power.' 
This sounds a little technocratic, but to make a long story short, you have family farmers faced with a monopoly when it comes to whom they sell their grain to. If they do not have some kind of loan rate that the Government guarantees that brings the price to a certain level, they have no bargaining power in the marketplace. 
Not surprisingly, the prices have plummeted. There is no safety net whatsoever. And now we see in our part of the country, in the Midwest, a family farm structure of agriculture which is in real peril. We see an economic convulsion. We see many family farmers who are going to be driven off the land. 
We are going to be coming to the floor of the Senate--you better believe we are going to be coming to the floor of the Senate--and we are going to be saying to our colleagues, `Look, you could have been for the `freedom to fail' bill or not, but there's going to have to be a modification. You are going to have to cap off the loan rate, and we're going to have to get the prices up for family farmers.' 
I would argue that in 1996--and I hope this will not be the debate again--what was going on here was a farm bill that was written by and for big corporate agribusiness interests. That is what it was. It was a great bill for the grain companies, but it was a disaster for family farmers. 
So we are going to revisit this debate. And once again, is it going to be the grain companies and the big food processors and the big chemical companies and the transportation companies, or is it going to be the family farmers? I hope it will be the family farmers. I hope our appeal to fairness and justice will work on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
But I tell you, all too often, as I look at these different issues in these different debates, it is no wonder, as Senator Levin said, that people are so disappointed and disillusioned with both political parties. It is no wonder that people do not register and do not vote. Because you know what? They have reached the conclusion that if you pay, you play, and if you do not pay, you do not play. 
They have reached the conclusion that this political process isn't their political process. I mean, my God, what happens in a representative democracy when people reach the conclusion that they are not stakeholders in the system, that when it comes to their concerns about themselves, about their families and their communities, their concerns are of little concern in the corridors of power in Washington? This is really dangerous. What is at stake is nothing less than our very noble, wonderful, 222-year experiment in self-rule and representative democracy. 
That is what it is really all about.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Now, let me give some other examples. We went through a debate about whether or not we were going to do anything to provide our children with some protection from being addicted to tobacco. Guess what happened? Tobacco companies, huge contributors, individual contributions to Senators and Representatives, big soft money, hundreds of thousands of dollars of contributions to the party, and guess what happened? As a special favor to those big tobacco interests, we didn't even provide our children with sensible protection. 
I fear as a special favor to the big insurance companies we are not going to eventually provide patients with the kind of protection that they need. I fear that as a special favor to those bottom dwellers of commerce who don't want to raise the minimum wage, we are not even going to raise the minimum wage for hard-pressed working people. 
What I see over and over and over again is a political process hijacked by and dominated by big money. I tell you, that is the opposite of the very idea of representative democracy, because the idea of representative democracy is that each person counts as one and no more than one. 
What we have instead is something quite different. Let's just think for a moment about what is on the table and what is not on the table, because I think this mix of money and politics, this is the ethical issue of our time. We are not talking about corruption as in the wrongdoing of individual office holders; we are talking about systematic corruption. What systematic corruption is all about is when too few people have the wealth, the power, and the vast majority of people are locked out. Some people march on Washington every day and other people have a voice that is never heard. 
Let's just think a little bit about what is on the table and what is not on the table. I think quite often money determines who runs for office. I will talk about who wins, what issues are put on the table, what passes, what doesn't. Let's talk about what is not on the table and maybe should be on the table. What is not on the table is the concentration of power in certain key sectors of our economy which poses such a threat to consumers in America. 
Think for a moment about the concentration of power in the telecommunications industry. If there is anything more important than the flow of information in a democracy, I don't know what it is. This is so important to us. Now, we had a telecommunications bill that passed a couple years ago, which, by the way, I think has led to more monopoly. What was interesting is that the anteroom right outside our Chamber was packed wall to wall. You couldn't get in here if you tried to get through that anteroom. Personally, I couldn't find truth, beauty and justice anywhere. There was a group of people representing a billion dollars here, another group of people representing a billion dollars over there. You name it. 
What is not on the table is a concentration of power in financial services or a concentration of power in agriculture or all the ways in which conglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table and are taking over the food industry. What is not on the table is a concentration of power in the health care system, the way in which just a few insurance companies can own and control most of the managed care plans in the United States of America. 
Again, I would say that we are moving toward this new century. I hope the brave new world isn't two airline companies. I come from a State where we now have a strike. In Minnesota we don't have a lot of choice. We can't walk from Minnesota to Washington, DC. Northwest Airlines has 85 percent of the flights in and out. What are we going to have--two airlines, two banks, two oil companies, one supermarket, two financial institutions, two health care plans? It is interesting that this isn't even on the table here. Could it be that these powerful economic interests are able to preempt some of the debate and some of the discussion by virtue of the huge contributions they can make with the soft money loophole that can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars? 
What is not on the table is, I argue, a frightening maldistribution of wealth and income in America. The goal of both political parties, the goal of political leaders, ought to be to improve the standard of living of all the people. Since we started collecting social science data, we have the greatest maldistribution of wealth and income we have ever had in our country. You don't hear a word about it. It is important for people, if they work hard, to be able to participate in the life of our country. It is important for people to be able to receive the fruits of their labor. 
We have this huge maldistribution of wealth and income. We are not even going to discuss it. Could it be that some of the people who are the most hard-pressed citizens in this country have basically become invisible? They are out of sight; they are out of mind. They don't have lobbyists. They don't make the big contributions. They don't even register to vote because they don't think either political party has much to say to them. They think both parties have been taken over by the same investors. Unfortunately, there is some truth to that. Unfortunately, we have given people entirely too much justification for that point of view. 
What is not on the table? What is not on the table is a set of social arrangements that allow children to be the most poverty-stricken group in America. One out of every four children under the age of 3 is growing up poor in America. One out of every two children of color under the age of 3 is growing up poor in America today. That is a national scandal. That is a betrayal of our heritage. Certainly we can do much better. 
Now, there are organizations like the Children's Defense Fund. They do great work. But it is a very unequal fight. It comes to whether or not you are going to have hundreds of billions of dollars of what we call tax expenditures--tax loopholes and deductions, corporation welfare, money that goes to all sorts of financial interests, some of the largest financial institutions, some of the largest corporations in America--or whether or not we are going to make a commitment to make sure that every child has the same opportunity to reach his or her full potential. This is the core issue. I am convinced that so many good things that could happen here get `trumped' by the way in which money dominates politics. 
Now, the House has passed a good campaign finance reform bill, the Shays-Meehan proposal. It is not everything that some of us would have liked. As a matter of fact, what is interesting is that the original McCain-Feingold bill applied to Senate races. I thought that was one of the most important things. We had voluntary spending caps--you can't mandate it--and at the same time an exchange for media time. That is gone. That was really important. So we are talking about a proposal that is a milder proposal, but it is an enormous step forward. It is an enormous step forward. 
There are other things that are going on in the country that I am excited about, that I wish for, that I think eventually we will get to. The clean money, clean election bill that some of us have introduced here on the Senate side is an exciting proposal. We have a lot of energy behind it at the State level. I think New York City will pass it. I think the State of Massachusetts will pass it. The State of Maine already did pass it. The State of Vermont passed it. There are initiatives in other States. 
Basically, with the clean money, clean election proposal, we get the big private money out. You say to the citizen, listen, for $5 a year, would you be willing to contribute to a clean money, clean election trust fund? And then those candidates who abide by spending limits and don't raise the private money, this money goes to their campaigns. You have a level playing field, and you own the elections, and you own your State capitol, and you don't have all of this mix of big money in politics. A lot of people in the country really like this proposal. I think the political problem here is we are not ready for it yet because the system is wired. It is wired to people who can raise the big money, and quite often, they are the incumbents. 
And a lot of people don't like to vote out a system that benefits them. But the McCain-Feingold bill represents a very important step forward--following on the heels of a really exciting victory in the House of Representatives. It is very important, very similar. It bans the soft money as my colleague, Senator Levin--and there is nobody with more intellectual capital in this area--discussed. Senator Levin knows all of the specifics. I am so impressed with him as a legislator, with his ability. He talked about it. I will just say that this is a huge loophole. It is all very amorphous. 
Corporations and unions can make these huge soft money contributions. We all end up calling for this money now because everybody is trapped by the same rotten system. It restricts issue advocacy, these phony issue ads that are disguised as not really election ads. I went through this. I don't mean this in the spirit of whining, but it started in 1996, in the spring in Minnesota, and it went on all summer. There were all of these ads that would come on TV and they bash you for this and bash you for that, but they don't say `vote against' whether you are Democrat or Republican; they just say `call.' It is unbelievable. They could be financed by soft money. A huge loophole, huge problem. This bill codifies the Beck Supreme Court decision requiring unions to notify their dues-paying members of their right to disallow political use of their dues. It improves disclosure and FEC enforcement. This bill would represent a substantial step forward. 
Mr. President, there is a wonderful speech that was given by Bill Moyers in December of 1997, the title of which is `The Soul of Democracy.' I want to quote from part of Bill Moyers' speech:  
If Carrie Bolton were here tonight, she could speak to this. The Reverend Carrie Bolton from North Carolina. You'd have a hard time seeing her because she is only so high and her head would barely reach the microphone. But you would hear her, of that I'm sure. The state legislature in North Carolina established a commission to look at campaign financing, and Carrie Bolton came to one of the hearings. She listened patiently as one speaker after another addressed the commissioners. And then it was her time. She spoke softly at first. Then the passion rose, and her words mesmerized her audience. When Carrie Bolton finished, they stood and cheered. This is what she said; listen to what Carrie Bolton said: 
`I was born to a mother and father married to each other, who were sharecroppers, who proceeded to have ten children. I picked cotton, which made some people rich. . . . I pulled tobacco. . .I shook peanuts. . .I dug up potatoes and picked cucumbers, and I went to school * * * with enthusiasm. And with great enthusiasm I memorized the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States, I learned the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, and I was inspired to believe that somehow those things symbolized hope for me against any odds I might come upon. 
`I am a divorcee, a single parent divorcee, and I earn enough money to take care of my two children and myself. And I have managed to get a high school diploma, a bachelor's degree, two master's degrees, and do post doctoral work. 
`I am energetic. I'm smart. I'm intelligent. 
`But a snowball would stand a better chance surviving in hell than I would running for political office in this country. Because I have no money. My family has no money. My friends do not have money. 
`Yet, I have ideas. I'm strong, I am powerful (with her right hand she lifts her left wrist)--people can feel my pulse. People who are working, and working hard, can feel what I feel. 
`But I can't tell them because I don't know how to get the spotlight to tell them. 
`Because I have no money.' 
Anyone who believes Carrie Bolton's cry isn't coming from the soul of democracy is living in a fool's paradise--a rich fool's paradise. 
That is from Bill Moyers' speech. He is my hero journalist. I think he has done some of the finest work. He concludes his speech by saying this: 
I have three grandchildren--Henry, 5; Thomas, 3; and 10-month-old Nancy Judith. I want them to grow up in a healthy, civil society, one where their political worth is not measured by their net worth. 
That is one of the reasons Bill Moyers goes on to argue that this is his passion, this is his work. He is right. This is the core issue. 
Now, Mr. President, I don't know that I would have the eloquence of Carrie Bolton, but I conclude this way because I see other colleagues who may want to speak. I can't forget my own experience. It is not quite Carrie Bolton's experience, but I ran for office in 1990, and it was amazing. I mean, you don't come to the floor to brag, but you don't run for office if you don't think you have the character and ideas. Basically, everywhere I went, the argument was made, `you don't have a chance.' I was a teacher, so I didn't have much money. My father was an unsuccessful writer. My mother was a cafeteria worker, a food service worker. My family didn't have any money. My wife Sheila worked in the library at the high school. Everywhere I would go--including on the Democrat side, not just the Republican side--people were trying to decide whether or not I was a viable candidate. It had nothing to do with content of character, nothing to do with ideas, nothing to do with leadership potential, and it had nothing to do with positions on issues. People just wanted to know how much money you raised. You were viable or you weren't viable. You were a good candidate or you were a bad one based upon how much money you yourself had--and I didn't have it--or how much money you would raise. 
It is unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable. There are so many people who can't run for that reason alone. I was lucky. I come from Minnesota, and I am emotional about how much I owe to them. They were an exception to the rule. We were outspent six or seven to one, and we won. Sometimes it happens--if you have a great green schoolbus to campaign in and a great grassroots organization. 
I am the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution from Russia. We have had a 222-year, bold, important experiment in self-rule in democracy, representative democracy. That is what is at jeopardy here. I have talked to people about potentially running for office. They don't want to. A lot of people, good people, don't want to run for office any longer because they can't stand the thought of this money chase. They can't stand doing it. Moreover, if you combine what the money is used for, with communication technology becoming the weapon of electoral conflict, people using the money for poison politics, all the attack stuff on TV, a lot of very good, sane people don't run. 
I think what is happening is a lot of good people aren't going to be involved in public affairs. A lot of young people are not going to get involved in public affairs. You get to where people are either millionaires or they have to raise millions of dollars. I think you get into this awful self-select where a whole lot of good men and women aren't going to run at all. I am not going to cite the polls because we have the evidence for this. Everybody knows it. Every Democrat and Republican knows full well that people are disengaged and disillusioned with politics in this country, and this is one of the central reasons. 
So, Mr. President, I simply say to my colleagues that we have a piece of legislation on the floor that follows up on an exciting victory in the House of Representatives, and we need to pass this legislation. I also say to my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--frankly, I can't figure out the opposition. People want to see this changed. People just hate the way in which they feel like money dominates politics. Those of us in office, and even those of us who are challenged for office, hate it. We hate raising the money; we hate this system. I would think if we wanted the people we represent to have more confidence and faith in us, more confidence and faith in this political process, more confidence and faith in the U.S. Senate, we would vote for the McCain-Feingold piece of legislation. 
So the debate will go on. We will have this vote. 
I say to my colleagues on the other side--which doesn't mean just Republicans because there are some Republicans who support this legislation--that I think they are making a big mistake filibustering. From my point of view, this should go on and on for the next however many weeks it takes. I don't think we should drop this one. This is the core issue. This is the core question. It speaks to all the issues that are important to people's lives. It speaks as to whether or not we are going to have a functioning democracy or not. 
As a Senator from Minnesota, from a good government State, from a reform State, from a progressive State, there is no more important position that I can take than to be for this reform legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from Massachusetts once again to speak about one of the most important issues facing American working families. At a time when our economy is performing well, many Americans who work hard, who work full time, still live in poverty. I don't know what better signal we could send at the end of this Congress to people who are working hard, trying to provide for their families, than to pass the American Family Fair Minimum Wage Act. 
This increase in the minimum wage, which Senator Kennedy and I and others intend to offer as an amendment, perhaps to the Bankruptcy bill, is the single most important step we can take in this country immediately to promote economic justice. It would lift the federal minimum wage to $6.15 an hour over two years. That is a one-dollar-an-hour raise for American workers who labor near the bottom rung of our economic ladder as we enter the 21st century. Many of these men and women work just as hard if not harder than many of us here in the Congress. Yet they very often live economically insecure lives. They deserve a raise. 
This modest raise would still leave the federal minimum wage at a level that would be worth less in real terms less than it was in 1968. 
We all know that glaring economic injustice and inequality remain in America. We can say that there are two Americas--one with greater and greater access to all the things that make life richer in possibilities, the other struggling daily to make ends meet. Even as our economy is generally performing well, the disparity between rich and poor continues to grow. If we want to declare that we honor work, we must value it properly. 
When I have toured the cafes of Minnesota, the streets of East L.A., the inner city of Chicago, people want to know how they can earn a decent living, how they can give their children the care they need and deserve. This minimum wage increase will help hard-working Minnesotans and all Americans in their efforts to make ends meet. 
Seventy-four percent of those who receive the minimum wage are adults. Sixty percent are women. Fifty percent work more than 35 hours a week. Eighty-two percent work at least 20 hours. These numbers tell a story. Raising the minimum wage will help hard-working Americans, many supporting families, to earn a decent living. 
The minimum wage disproportionately affects women, many of whom are single heads of households with children. Sixty percent of those who earn minimum wage are women. They are teachers' aides, they are child care providers. They work hard, yet they make $10,700 a year. That's $2,900 below the poverty line for a family of three. That's not a living wage. To lift themselves from poverty, they must earn a fair living wage. 
Some opponents of increasing the minimum wage argue that it will cause job losses and actually hurt workers. Recent experience effectively rebuts that claim. An Economic Policy Institute report released this year demonstrates that the minimum wage increase which took effect during 1996 and 1997 raised the wages of almost 10 million people. Seventy-one percent were adults and 58 percent were women. Just under half worked full-time. The research also found that the increases had disproportionately benefited low-income working households. Although households in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution receive only 5 percent of total family income, they received 35 percent of the benefits from the minimum wage increases. Four different economic tests of these minimum-wage increases failed to find any systematic, significant job loss associated with the 1996-97 increases. 
The overall conclusion of the EPI report was that the 1996-97 increase in the minimum wage proved to be an effective tool for raising the earnings of low-wage workers without lowering their employment opportunities. In other words, it worked. 
So now it is our responsibility to continue this process and assure that more Americans are able to earn a liveable wage. If we do not raise the minimum wage now, by the year 2000 the real value of the minimum wage will only be $4.28 an hour--almost as low as it was when the 1996 bill was enacted. We must act now to allow 12 million workers to benefit from this increase. 
In my home state, this minimum wage increase will benefit at least 147,000 working Minnesotans and probably more because when we increase the minimum wage, it applies pressure to increase wages for people also making slightly more than the minimum wage. In 1996, 39% of Minnesota's workers paid at the minimum wage were between the ages of 16 and 21. Now, those numbers show us two important things: first, that the majority of Minnesotans just like the majority of Americans earning the minimum wage are adults. This issue is not just about helping youngsters looking for a paying job after school. But second, at the same time, many of these minimum wage workers between the ages of 16 and 21 are trying to make money to stay in school, to pay the bills as they study to receive their college degrees. In Minnesota, we have record low unemployment, but state statistics show that increasing the minimum wage will not significantly affect the number of minimum wage jobs available for people needing the work to make ends meet. 
We celebrate the affluence that so many Americans have enjoyed in recent years. We need to make sure that the opportunity to share in that prosperity is available to all Americans, whether they are in the top 20 percent of wage-earners or the bottom 20 percent. People rightly believe that if you play by the rules in America, if you work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, then you should not be poor. 
Increasing the minimum wage is about justice and a livable wage. The American public supports it, and we should pass it. 
Let me again thank Senator Kennedy. This will be my eighth year in the Senate. I don't think there is anybody in the U.S. Senate, I don't think there is anybody close, to Senator Ted Kennedy leading this fight. It is an economic justice fight. We raised the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour and people thought that couldn't be done. Senator Kennedy led that fight and we did it. I am confident we are going to do it again. We are going to have an amendment on the bankruptcy bill and are going to talk about raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over a 2-year period, and I think we will have a positive vote for it. It is the right thing to do. The majority of the people support it and this should be a priority for us. 
Let me make three points. I heard my colleague from Massachusetts, and I am proud to join him in this effort and can't wait to have the debate. And I am proud to join Senator Durbin from Illinois. I heard my colleague from Massachusetts talk about this being a family issue. I am pretty well convinced now, from the Minnesota State Fair to talking with people in cafes, to traveling the country, that this really is a family issue. If there is one thing we could do--and, you know what, my colleague, the Presiding Officer, I think, agrees with me, at least in part of what I am about to say--if there is one thing we can do more than anything else, it is to try to basically say our major goal is to make sure that parents, or parent, can do their very best by their kids. Because if parents can do their best by their kids, they are going to do their best for Arkansas or Minnesota or Illinois or Massachusetts or for the country. And part of being able to do well for your kids is to have a living wage job, to be able to make a decent living. 
As I travel around the country, whether it be in metropolitan Minnesota or whether it be in the farm and rural areas, or whether it be Delta, MS, or East L.A. or Watts or inner-city Chicago or inner-city Baltimore, or where my wife's family are from, Letcher and Harlan Counties, Appalachia, KY, I think more than anything else, what people say to me--and my most recent focus group is the Minnesota State Fair, where about half the population comes in about 2 weeks--right now we have the State Fair there. People are focused on how to earn a decent living and how to give their children the care they know they need and deserve. 
That is what it is all about. 
Mr. President, I think the policy goal for us ought to be as follows: When people work almost 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, they should not be poor in America. I bet any poll will show that 80 percent of the people agree with that. When people work almost 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, they shouldn't be poor in our country. It is that simple. 
There are a number of things we can do that will make a real difference for families. We can have affordable health care. We should do that. We haven't done it yet. We should have affordable child care. We should figure out ways of providing assistance to parents, whether their child is in a family child care setting or child care center or staying at home. 
The final thing we ought to do is raise the minimum wage; $5.15 to $6.15 is not unreasonable. My colleague from Massachusetts pointed out the work of the Economic Policy Institute. Everybody said the sky would fall. We have been going through this, I say to Senator Kennedy, for half a century: If you raise the minimum wage, people will lose jobs. It did not happen; it will not happen. People, in fact, will have more money to buy and consume, which helps our economy. 
Mr. President, I simply say to my colleagues that this is terribly important to women, because many of our minimum-wage workers are women. It is terribly important to adults, because the vast majority of minimum-wage workers are adults. It is also important to younger people whom maybe we do not view as adults--18, 19, 20, 21. Many of them are working to go to college. 
This is a matter of economic justice. It is a matter of elementary decency. 
I close with a more hard-hitting point. This is one I am not that comfortable with, but I think it really is true and needs to be said. My colleague said it once, and I will say it again. We don't have any hesitation in voting to raise our salaries. We make $130,000 a year. We ought to be willing to vote a decent minimum wage for people. We really ought to be able to do that. 
Colleagues have talked to me about how `I need to make $130,000; I have two children, they are in college; I have an apartment here, live back home, it is very hard.' My gosh, that is a pretty significant salary we make. I am not bashing public service. I believe in public service. But I think we also can vote for a higher minimum wage for working families in this country. We should do this, and we will bring this amendment to the floor. 
We are going to have a major debate, and all of us will be accountable as to how we vote. I hope we have an overwhelming vote for increasing the minimum wage. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before coming back, I was at the Minnesota State Fair, which is quite a focus group--almost half the State's population comes there in 13 days. Without going through my conversations with people in Minnesota, I want to ask you whether or not back home in South Dakota or as you travel around the country, what kind of discussions do citizens have with you about the mix of money and politics and reform? 
Does the minority leader think that this is, in fact, a burning issue to people? We have been told for so long that people don't really care about campaign finance reform. What is the minority leader hearing from people in South Dakota? What is he hearing from citizens in our country? Why does he, as the leader of our party, put this at the very top of his priorities?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise again this morning to speak against the conference report to H.R. 629. This is the Texas-Maine-Vermont Compact which will result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste from Texas, Maine, and Vermont, and potentially other States, at a dump located in Texas. 
The dump is expected to be built in the town of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County where 66 percent of the residents are Latino, and 39 percent live below the poverty line. 
Mr. President, the construction of this dump site in this community raises important questions of environmental justice. This is not just about the people in Hudspeth County or about the people in Sierra Blanca, or about west Texas for that matter. This is a fight for communities all across the country who do not have the political clout to keep this pollution out. This is a fight for minority communities who are burdened with a disproportionate share of these sites. 
It seems to be a pattern in our country, whenever we decide where we are going to build a power line or where we are going to build a nuclear waste dump site or where we are going to put an incinerator, it never is located in communities where people who live in those communities have political clout. It is not located where the heavy hitters and the well-connected and the people who give the big contributions live. It is almost always located in communities of color. 
Mr. President, there is an article today that I recommend for my colleagues in the New York Times entitled, `For Some, Texas Town Is Too Popular as Waste Disposal Site.' This is all about what we are debating today. I just read the conclusion. Maria Mendez, a retired school aide from Allamore, who lives in the community, is quoted as saying: 
I think Sierra Blanca was chosen for all this dumping because we don't have any political clout. I think it's a racism thing; I really do. Here we are, the hugest dump in the whole world. First sludge, now nuclear waste. Our home has been taken over as the nation's dumping ground. 
Mr. President and colleagues, environmental justice is a difficult issue. Too often we hide behind excuses. We say, `These are private sector decisions. This is a matter of State and local responsibility. It is too hard to prove.' But this is pretty easy. The dump will not be built if we reject this compact. We have direct responsibility, we have a Federal role, a direct Federal role. We cannot wash our hands of this. We cannot walk away and pretend we are not to blame. We are all responsible. And it is important to take a stand. 
This compact raises troubling issues of environmental justice. In this case, the Texas Legislature selected Hudspeth County. They already selected Hudspeth County. And the Texas Waste Authority selected the Sierra Blanca site after the Authority's scoping study had already ruled out Sierra Blanca as scientifically unsuitable. The Waste Authority selected the site after the Authority's own scoping study had ruled Sierra Blanca out as scientifically unsuitable; that is to say a geologically active area; that is to say an earthquake area. 
Communities near the preferred site have had enough political clout to keep the dump out, but Sierra Blanca--already the site of the largest sewage sludge project in our country--was not so fortunate. The Waste Authority does a scoping study. The scoping study says this is not scientifically suitable, but the Waste Authority goes ahead and chooses this community. Why not? Disproportionately poor, disproportionately Latino. This is an issue of environmental justice. 
The residents of Sierra Blanca, Hudspeth County and west Texas do not want this dump. Last night, some of my colleagues talked about the election of one official, and they said the people want this dump. This candidate was elected, and he was for it. But twenty surrounding counties and 13 nearby cities have passed resolutions against it. And no city or county in west Texas supports it. 
Nor would any Senator in this Chamber want this waste dump site built in their backyard. I doubt whether any Senator in this Chamber has ever been faced with this. These waste dump sites are not put where Senators live. They are put in the communities disproportionately of color, disproportionately low-income. This is a debate about environmental justice in our country. 
Over 800 adult residents of Sierra Blanca have signed petitions opposing the dump. A 1992 poll, commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority, showed 64 percent opposition in Hudspeth and Culberson Counties. Republican Congressman Bonilla, who represents Hudspeth County, and Democratic Congressmen Reyes and Rodriguez, who represent neighboring El Paso and San Antonio, have all actively opposed the dump site. 
In an October 1994 statewide poll, 82 percent of Texans said they were against it. Local residents have had no say over whether the waste dump site will be constructed in Sierra Blanca. They were never consulted at any stage in the decision-making process. 
As a matter of fact, Mr. President, a 1984 public opinion survey commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority provides some useful context for what is going on. Let me just quote from what their consultant said. This is the report:  
One population that may benefit from [a public information] campaign is Hispanics, particularly those with little formal education and low incomes. This group is the least informed of all segments of the population. . . . The Authority should be aware, however, that increasing the level of knowledge of Hispanics may simply increase opposition to the [radioactive dump] site, inasmuch as we have discovered a strong relationship in the total sample between increased perceived knowledge and increased opposition. 
The concern is that if this poor Hispanic community finds out more about this, they will be opposed to it. Indeed, people in the community are opposed. And they should be. 
Mr. President, my colleague, with all due respect, last night said we need to have the compact to protect the people in Hudspeth County from becoming a national repository of nuclear waste. That is not the way it works. 
The conference report on H.R. 629 would allow appointed compact commissioners to import radioactive waste from any State or territory. And both the State of Texas and nuclear utilities across the country will have an economic incentive to bring as much waste as possible to make this site economically viable and to reduce their disposal costs. 
Section 3.05, paragraph 6 of the compact provides that the Compact Commission may enter into an agreement with any person, State, regional body, or group of States for importation of low-level radioactive waste. All it requires is a majority vote of the eight unelected compact commissioners. 
Mr. President, the Texas Observer, March 28, 1997, had it right: 
More than two or three national dumps will drive fees so low that profit margins anticipated by states (and now private investors) will be threatened. This economic reality--and growing public resistance to the dumps--has raised the very real possibility that the next dump permitted will be the nuclear waste depository for the whole nation, for decades to come. 
Of these nine compacts, I want to point out to my colleagues that not one compact has built a nuclear waste dump site. 
Mr. President, here is what is so egregious about what has happened here. To avoid turning this low-income, Mexican-American community into a national repository for radioactive waste, I offered two amendments. Colleagues, this is really what the vote is about. Twice you have been on record. The Senate has unanimously said, A, `We support an amendment which makes it clear that the waste can only come from Maine, Vermont, and Texas. We support an amendment that puts in the language what we say this is about.' That was passed twice by the unanimous vote of the U.S. Senate. 
The second amendment said that the people in Hudspeth County would have a chance to prove local discrimination in court, that if they could show they have been unfairly targeted then they could go to court to challenge this. 
My colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, we have gone on record twice supporting these amendments. In the dark of night--no wonder people get so disillusioned about this process--the conference committee stripped out both amendments, took both amendments out. 
Would it be such a crime if we passed this compact with an amendment that made it clear that the waste could only come from Texas, Maine, and Vermont? That is what they say the compact is about. Would it be such a crime if this Hispanic community had some way of seeking redress of grievance and could challenge discrimination in court? That amendment was taken out. 
That is why this compact is flawed. That is why we should vote against it. 
Environmental justice is a national responsibility. We have a national responsibility to remedy this injustice because if we do not, the Congress will be complicit in the construction of this dump. 
This is not purely a State or local issue. We have to vote on it. We have to vote up or down. That is what our constitutional system is all about. This compact requires congressional consent. The Texas Compact cannot take effect without Federal legislation, since all 50 States--not just the compact States--will be asked to give their consent. 
Construction of the Sierra Blanca dump depends upon enactment of this conference report. If we reject it today, Texas will not build a dump in Sierra Blanca. But within 60 days of enactment, if you vote for this, Maine and Vermont will pay Texas $25 million to begin construction. 
Let me point out this is different from all the other compacts because it is crystal clear where the site is going to be. The Texas Legislature already selected Hudspeth County, and the Texas Waste Authority already identified a dump site near Sierra Blanca. That is what is at issue here. 
Our consent ought to be conditional. We ought to make it clear that the compact can take effect only if the waste comes from these three States only. But the conference committee knocked that amendment out--the utility companies didn't want that. 
We ought to make it clear the people of Hudspeth County at least have a right to appeal this site selection. I think people in Maine and Vermont agree with that idea, but we took that amendment out. 
This is not a debate about State or local rights. The conference committee followed the wishes of the nuclear utilities, not the local residents--the utilities who were going to benefit from cheap disposal of nuclear waste. They supported this legislation with no amendments. That is why this legislation is so flawed. 
On July 7, 1998, two administrative hearing officers recommended that the license for the Sierra Blanca dump be denied. They made a good decision. What they said was that this is a tectonically active area. We have a very real danger of earthquakes. This does not make sense from the point of view of science. And they were right. 
But the problem is that the Texas Environmental Agency, the TNRCC, made up of officials appointed by the Governor, are not bound by what these hearing officers have recommended. The executive director has gone on record saying that he doesn't agree. And the Governor has gone on record saying that Hudspeth County and Sierra Blanca is the right place for this dump to be. 
I say to my colleagues that we really have two choices here. We can say, look, if we don't know where the site is going to be, then let's put off the vote. But, no, that is not what we are doing. The idea here is to just ram this through. As soon as we do, believe me, it will go in Hudspeth County, Sierra Blanca. That will be a travesty. 
I want to just cite for colleagues the broad coalition of religious, environmental, social justice and public interest groups that oppose this: The League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC; Greenpeace; the Texas NAACP; the Mexican American Legislative Caucus of the Texas House of Representatives; the Sierra Club; the House Hispanic Caucus; the Bishop and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso; the United Methodist Church General Board of Church and Society; Friends of the Earth; Physicians for Social Responsibility; the League of Conservation Voters; and 100 other local and national civic organizations.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me read a portion of the letter. 
This letter is to express my concern about the Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact and its environmental justice implications. The issue is plain and simple. To allow the compact to go forward would be an act of environmental injustice that follows a national pattern of siting waste facilities and other LULUs [locally unwanted land uses] in people of color and low-income communities. Having . . . researched environmental problems in communities of color for more than two decades, it is very clear to me that the Sierra Blanca case is a classic case of environmental racism. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, A, this is the only compact the Senate has considered where we have a site identified for construction of a compact dump. In this particular case, 90 percent or more of that waste is going to come from nuclear power plants. 
B, with all due respect to my colleague, the argument that the people in Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County want this is an argument that just cannot be accepted on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Eight hundred adult residents of this town of Sierra Blanca signed petitions in opposition. A 1992 poll commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority showed 64 percent in opposition. In a poll in 1994, 82 percent of Texans were against it. It just doesn't wash. 
Third, as colleagues follow this debate, again, the Texas legislature selected Hudspeth County. The Texas Waste Authority selected the Sierra Blanca site after the Authority's own scoping study said it is not scientifically suitable. But this was the path of least political resistance. This is an issue of environmental justice. This is being put on the back of a community that is disproportionately Hispanic and poor. That is what today's article in the New York Times is all about. 
Finally, let me name some of the members of a coalition of religious, environmental, social justice and public interest groups who oppose the compact. I cite the League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC. The Latino community should make us accountable on this vote. This is an issue of environmental justice. Then there is GreenPeace, the Texas NAACP, the Texas House of Representatives Mexican-American Legislative Caucus, the Sierra Club, the House Hispanic Caucus, and the League of Conservation Voters. I reserve my final 2 minutes, the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that the site has been selected. The only remaining question is final licensing. The site in Hudspeth County, Sierra Blanca, is disproportionately Hispanic and disproportionately poor. That is what this debate is all about. This is an injustice. If you vote for this compact, you will be ratifying this injustice. If you vote against this compact, then this will not happen. 
That is why LULAC, that is why the League of Conservation Voters, that is why the Sierra Club, that is why the religious community, that is why 100 different organizations from around the country, that is why people came here, as difficult as it was, all the way from Hudspeth County to say please don't do this. 
We had two amendments that would have made this fair. 
Please, colleagues, listen to this. One amendment that you voted for said that if the people in Hudspeth County can prove that this is discriminatory, they should have a right to do so in court. The other amendment says let's make it clear that the waste can only come from Maine, Vermont, and Texas. Twice the Senate went on record with unanimous votes supporting both those amendments, and in the conference committee those amendments were knocked out. The utility industry wanted them knocked out. They don't want the people to have any kind of remedy for discrimination. There is no assurance that the waste will come just from Maine, Vermont, and Texas. They want this to be a national repository site. 
That is why we should vote against this compact--the first compact ever with a clear site for building a compact nuclear waste dump. This is an environmental injustice. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Colleagues, you have never voted for a compact with a specific site for building a compact dump, not with a site in Sierra Blanca, not with a site disproportionately Hispanic and poor. 
This is an environmental vote. This is a geologically active area. The science says no, but it is the path of least political resistance. This community is targeted. We will now vote. If you vote for this compact, you vote for an injustice. Do the right thing and vote against this compact. 
Twice you have gone on record, colleagues, by unanimous vote: yes, for the compact as long as people have a right to challenge this and have a chance to prove discrimination. Yes, we vote for the compact if we make it clear that this won't become a national repository site and the waste can only come from Maine and Vermont and Texas. And both of those amendments, in the dark of night, were stripped by the conference committee. 
That is why so many religious and civil rights organizations have said vote against this. LULAC, the League of Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, the Catholic diocese, the Methodist Church, so on and so forth. This is a justice vote. We have to vote on this, and once and for all it is important for us to be on the side of justice and vote no on this compact.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
Let me also congratulate Senator Thurmond for this remarkable record. 
I just have two things to say. One is, I think one of the ways that we should evaluate Senators is just how they treat people. I say to the pages, I don't know over the years how many times I have seen Senator Thurmond have ice cream with the pages. I don't know how many times I have seen him constantly being so gracious and having a good time and talking with and treating people really well--support staff, whether they be elevator operators or you name it. 
I just would like to thank Senator Thurmond, not always for the position he takes on issues, but for the way he treats people, which I think might matter more than anything else. 
Then finally, Strom, since I am being so nice here on the floor and saying exactly what I believe, I would like to ask you a favor. Since I came out here to congratulate you, next time when you shake my hand or grab my shoulder, could you do it just a little more gently? 
I yield the floor. (Laughter.)

Before the recess, it was my understanding, albeit not a written contract, that we would not burn up all the time; that we would reserve 1 hour equally divided for tomorrow before the final vote.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, it is unfortunate that maybe there were a number of different parties involved in this, but I was very clear that I wanted to make sure there was time for this debate also tomorrow morning, not late tonight. 
I say to colleagues--it is not personal to my colleague from Maine--I am going to object to adjournment tonight, and Senators are going to have to come back here tonight at midnight and vote if I don't get a half an hour tomorrow. I know what was said. I know what was the understanding, and this is an important enough issue that tomorrow morning--and the other side can take a half hour, too--that we should have a debate. It shouldn't go from 7 o'clock now until 10 o'clock, time is burned off, no time to discuss this tomorrow morning, and then there is a vote. I think that is unacceptable. 
I guess we are starting the debate off in the wrong way. In all due respect, a lot of the decisions made on this matter have been made kind of in the dark of night in the conference committee. I want part of this debate to be open. I want Senators to be aware of this. I want the public to be aware of it. 
I renew my request one more time just so I know where I am at tonight. I ask unanimous consent that we have an hour equally divided tomorrow morning before final vote.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, I am going to stick to this because this is, I think, an important issue. It takes time to lay out the context and the background. I know the way it works here. This now has been put off close to 7 o'clock. I understand that. I just think that 15 minutes is not a lot of time to go into the complexity of this. I know at least what was my understanding, and I say to my colleague from Maine, this was not a direct conversation with her. In no way, shape, or form am I trying to say she had implied otherwise. 
I am going to be firm about this. Perhaps we could--and I wouldn't be totally satisfied with it--but perhaps we could save colleagues some trouble and do 40 minutes equally divided. I ask unanimous consent that there be 40 minutes, 20 minutes on each side, so colleagues don't have to come back tonight and vote at midnight.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think my colleague from Vermont has been on the floor a long time today. He said he needed a brief period of time. If I could take a minute--and only a minute, I say to my colleague from Vermont, whom I appreciate as a real friend here, I will talk about the actual sites, Hudspeth and Sierra Blanca, and how this is all taking place. 
This is an issue of environmental justice. But this nuclear waste is not just gloves and medical waste. My colleague talked about that. Ninety-nine percent of this low-level radioactive waste in Maine and Vermont will come from nuclear reactors. Let's just be clear about that. 
Second of all, the distinction between low-level and high-level--I will read from a GAO report of this year. 
Any radioactive waste that are not high-level are low-level, and as a result, low-level radioactive waste constitute a very broad category containing many different types and concentrations of radio nuclei, including the same radio nuclei that may be found in high-level radioactive waste. 
This is an artificial distinction. It is not just medical waste. It sounds better when we talk about booties and gloves. Low-level waste constitutes all of the same public health concerns to the people who live in Sierra Blanca. I want to be clear about that. 
I ask my colleague from Vermont, how much time does he think he will need?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me start out by saying to my colleague from Vermont that this debate is not about suggesting that a dump has to be built in the Northeast. That is not what this debate is about. I say that to my colleague from Maine. No one has ever suggested that. 
Let me also say that I have to smile as I hear my colleagues say that we need this compact to provide people in Texas with the guarantee that their dump won't become a depository, a national depository for waste. If there is no dump, they don't need the protection. This is an interesting argument--we have to have a compact--which, by the way, I don't think holds up under scrutiny. I will talk about that in a moment. We have to have a compact in order to give people in Texas--it is really in their self-interest. This compact will provide them with some protection that they won't have nuclear waste coming into their State from all over the country. By definition, if the dump isn't built, if the compact doesn't go through, then there won't be any nuclear waste dump, and, therefore, people in Texas won't have to worry about that protection. It is just a curious argument that caught my attention. 
Mr. President, I want to say at the beginning that I rise to speak with as much passion and as much evidence that I can marshal as possible against this conference report, H.R. 629, the Texas, Maine, and Vermont compact, which will result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste from Texas, Maine, and Vermont, and potentially other States and territories, at a dump located in Texas. The dump is expected to be built near the town of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County where 66 percent of the residents are Latino and 39 percent live below the poverty line. Let's not be fooling anybody. Here is what happened. This is what we have to vote on one way or another. 
In Texas, the decision has to be made. Where are you going to put a nuclear waste dump site? Not surprisingly, when you have a former Governor here, or someone else living in another community who is politically connected there, none of those sites is considered. Instead, what we come up with--I will go through the whole history of this--is Sierra Blanca, Hudspeth County. This happens to be a community that is disproportionately Hispanic and disproportionately poor. And that is why this is a civil rights issue. That is why, colleagues, a lot of organizations--Latino and Latina--and a lot of environmental organizations are on record against this compact. 
This is going the path of least political resistance. That is what this is about. 
This is an issue of environmental justice. It is the business of all of us in the U.S. Senate, because we have to vote for or against this compact. 
All of a sudden--I will get to this a little later on as well--some administrative law judges take a look at this, and they say, `You know what? This might not be a good idea because this is a geologically active area.' That is a euphemism for an earthquake area. That is true. They have said that. But the problem is that the members of the commission in Texas that has made the decision are the Governor's appointees, and they don't have to listen to what these administrative law judges have said. And the executive director of this commission has made it clear that he won't. The Governor has made it clear that he is going forward with this. 
But what we have here is an interesting game. No wonder people get angry about politics. What the State of Texas is saying is: Let's just put it off and not make the final decision though we know what the final decision is. We are going to locate this in a community where you have poor people and Hispanic people living. But we will not do that right away. Instead, we say we really haven't decided, and therefore we can get people in the Senate and the House of Representatives, we can give them cover, and they can say, `Oh, no, this isn't about environmental justice because they haven't selected the site.' 
I will go through this in a moment. That is an absolute sham. That is just a sham. 
Mr. President, let me be real clear about this. The area that is chosen in Texas, not surprisingly, because this is apparent all around the country--poor people always take it on the chin. The communities of color always take it on the chin. Where are you going to put an incinerator? Where are you going to put a waste dump site? It is never in our backyard. 
I would like to know whether any Senator has ever had a nuclear waste dump site proposed in his or her backyard or his or her community. And while I have not taken the survey, I bet the answer is not one. 
This has to stop. This is an issue of environmental justice. That is why we are not just going to talk about this tonight. We are going to talk about this tomorrow, regardless of what the vote is. 
Mr. President, here is what is really troubling about this process. We have been through this over a period of a year. It has been kind of one-sided, I say to my colleague in the Chair. It has been sort of like you have people--we have some people here tonight from Hudspeth County. We have people from other communities. We have some State legislators. We have people from the community. But you know what, they get to come up like once a year maybe. It is a long trip, costs a lot of money. But at the same time the utility industry--this isn't about States rights. This is about the utility industry, what the nuclear power industry wants, what the energy industry wants, what the big contributors want as opposed to the people who live in this community who have precious little by way of campaign contributions they can make. This is tied to reform and precious little clout, except this little community has been fighting hard for a year. 
So what happened here? I came to the floor of the Senate twice and my colleagues agreed. I didn't hear anybody dissent. There was unanimous consent. Twice I came to the floor of the Senate with amendments. One amendment said let's make it clear that this nuclear waste can only come from Maine, Vermont and Texas. That is what we say it is about. So let's codify that. That amendment was passed in the House of Representatives as well. 
The other amendment said if the people of Hudspeth County, as they seek redress of grievance, can show that they have been disproportionately targeted because they are Latina, Latino or poor, they should at least have the right to challenge this in court. And my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, supported these amendments. 
That is exactly what happens when an amendment passes on the floor of the Senate with unanimous consent. But then what do they do? They rely on the conference committee. I am starting to believe in a unicameral legislature, I really am, because I think the conference committee is the third house of the Congress and there is no accountability. This conference committee meets sometime, I don't know, 2 a.m., 1 a.m., sometime in the dark of night. Who knows when. And they just bulldoze right through and they knock out both amendments. The Senate is on record twice, first of all, voting for the amendments and then instructions to the conferees to honor the Senate's position. 
Colleagues, they took those amendments out. And when you vote tomorrow, please, remember the Latina and Latino community, please remember the organizations, remember the environmental organizations, and other organizations I am going to refer to because they are going to be watching our vote. 
Now, it would have been one thing if those amendments had stayed in. I think you would have had more support for this compact, or at least people could have said, well, you know what, at least now we know we are not going to get the shaft at least in one sense. People wouldn't have wanted it in their 
community, nor would the Presiding Officer, nor would my colleague from Maine, nor would any Senator here. No Senator here would want this waste dump site in their backyard, not one Senator, but it at least would have made this political process look a little bit more open and maybe a little fairer to people, if we had kept the amendments in. 
But, oh, no, the conference committee meets somewhere, sometime and takes them out. So I will tell you, this compact should be defeated. 
Now, the construction of this nuclear dump in this community raises important questions of environmental justice. This might be the first time in the history of the Senate we have had a debate about environmental justice in the Chamber. It is not just the fight for the people of Sierra Blanca or Hudspeth County or west Texas, for that matter. This is a fight for communities all across the country that don't have the political clout, that aren't the well heeled, that aren't the well connected, that aren't the investors, that aren't the big contributors, and all too often over and over again they are the ones we dump these sites on. This is a fight for poor people and poor communities that are rarely consulted. 
This is a fight for people who are seen not as people who should have some say about their environment and their lives but as victims to be preyed upon because they are least able to defend themselves. Except the communities of Hudspeth County, Sierra Blanca, they have made it clear they are not victims. They have made it clear they are women and men of worth and dignity and substance, and they have been fighting hard. 
Environmental justice, colleagues, is a difficult issue. Too often legislators and Government officials hide behind the excuse that there is nothing we can do about it, that discrimination results from decisions that are made in the private sector, that it is a matter of State or local responsibility, that it is too hard to prove. Well, this case is pretty easy. The dump won't be built if we reject this compact. We have a direct responsibility. There is a direct Federal role. We cannot wash our hands of this. We cannot go away and pretend that we are not to blame. We are all responsible, and it is up to each and every one of us to take a stand. 
Let me go over some of the arguments. Argument No. 1: The Texas Compact raises troubling issues of environmental justice. There is a well-documented tendency for pollution and waste dump sites to be sited in poor minority communities that lack the political power to keep them out. In this case, the Texas Legislature selected Hudspeth County and the Texas Waste Authority selected the Sierra Blanca site after the Authority, after the Authority's scoping study had already ruled out Sierra Blanca as scientifically unsuitable. 
Did you get that? Did you get that, colleagues, or staff, that are following this debate? The Texas Waste Authority selected the Sierra Blanca site after the Authority's own scoping study had already ruled out Sierra Blanca as scientifically unsuitable. Communities near the study's preferred sites had enough political clout to keep the dump out but Sierra Blanca, already the site of the largest sewage sludge project in the country, was not so fortunate. 
There you go. There is the calculus. You have this poor Hispanic community. They have the largest sewage sludge project in the country. Why not just build a nuclear waste dump site there as well? Sierra Blanca is a low-income, Mexican-American community. Over 66 percent of the citizens of Sierra Blanca are Mexican-American and many do not speak English. About 39 percent live below the poverty line. Hudspeth County is one of the poorest and most heavily Latino areas of Texas. Under the Texas government code, Sierra Blanca is legally classified as a `colonia,' which is an economically distressed area within 150 miles of the Mexican border that possesses inadequate water and sewer services, and this is the community that has been targeted for this nuclear waste dump site. 
Sierra Blanca is already the site of the largest sewage sludge project in the country, and the Environmental Protection Improvement Corporation is now asking the Texas environmental agency for a license for yet another sewage sludge project east of Sierra Blanca. 
Now, I ask my colleagues, I ask the Presiding Officer, if you had the largest sewage sludge project in your community, you are now targeted for another one, and on top of that you would have a nuclear waste dump site also in your community, even though it is a geologically unstable community, earthquake area, would you not have some questions about this? 
I heard my colleagues say somewhere that a judge had won an election and, therefore, oh, no, the people there really want it. Look, why don't we just think about this for a moment? Do you really believe that? Do you really believe that? Do you really believe the people in any of the communities that we represent would really want a nuclear waste dump site where they live, on top of the largest sewage sludge project in the country? Do you believe that? 
Mr. President, 20 surrounding counties and 13 nearby cities have passed resolutions against it and no city or county in west Texas supports it. I hear one person is elect and that is used as the basis for arguing that the people in the community want it? Give me a break. Give me a break. Mr. President, 20 surrounding counties and 13 nearby cities have passed resolutions against it and no city or county in west Texas supports it. Over 800 adult residents of Sierra Blanca have signed petitions opposing the dump, and a 1992 poll commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority showed that 66 percent of the people in Hudspeth and Culberson Counties were in opposition. Republican Congressman Bonilla, who represents Hudspeth County, and Democratic Congressman Ciro Rodriguez, who represent neighboring El Paso and San Antonio, have all actively opposed the Sierra Blanca dump. And we are being told the people support it? 
In an October 1994 statewide poll, 82 percent of Texans were against it--82 percent. Earlier this month, 1,500 U.S. and Mexican citizens, including Texas State Representatives and Senators and Representatives from Mexico, marched from the Mexican border to Sierra Blanca, through scorching desert heat--and it has been hot in Texas--to protest the dump. Local residents have had no say over whether the waste dump should be constructed in Sierra Blanca; no say. They never were consulted at any stage in the process, but rather they were informed after the fact. Each time the waste authority or the legislature selected Hudspeth County for a dump site, and especially after local residents had already won a court case to reverse the selection of Fort Hancock, the news took local residents by complete surprise. At no stage in the site selection process were the residents of Sierra Blanca involved in the decisionmaking. 
Now, I said this is an environmental justice question. Listen to this, and I will come back with this tomorrow morning again. A 1984 public opinion survey commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority provides some real useful context for how this has all taken place. The report is called, `An Analysis of Public Opinion on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal in Selected Areas.' This report goes on to talk about the benefits of keeping the Latinos uninformed:  
One population that may benefit from [a public information] campaign is Hispanics, particularly those with little formal education and low incomes. This group is the least informed of all segments of the population. . .. The Authority should be aware, however, that increasing the level of knowledge of Hispanics may simply increase opposition to the [radioactive dump] site, inasmuch as we have discovered a strong relationship in the total sample between increased perceived knowledge and increased opposition. 
I'll tell you what, I would be ashamed to be a decisionmaker in any kind of process, any kind of consulting report, saying: Better not have these Latinos informed because 
there is a strong correlation between the amount of their perceived knowledge and their increased opposition. 
Well, I guess so. I guess, if every Senator had knowledge of a nuclear waste dump site that was going to be dumped in his or her backyard, the more he or she knew, the more likely they would be in opposition. And we are being told the people in the community just can't wait to have this. There is a danger. I am in profound disagreement with my colleagues that this poor Hispanic community could become a national repository for low-level radioactive waste. We are being told that this will be their savior, this compact will protect them from becoming a national repository. 
The conference report--and if my colleagues have any information or facts that contradict what I am about to say, I would certainly appreciate hearing it--the conference report on H.R. 629 would allow appointed compact commissioners to import radioactive waste from any State or territory. They have it within their authority to do so. There is no language that prohibits them from doing so. And both the State of Texas and nuclear utilities across the country will have an economic incentive to bring in as much waste as possible to make the dump economically viable and to reduce the disposal costs. 
Let me be clear about it again. This conference report does not have one word that would prohibit the appointed compact commissioners from importing radioactive waste from any State or territory in the country. If you had not stripped out our amendment, which the Senate unanimously supported twice, which said that the waste can only come from Texas and Vermont and Maine, then there would be some protection of this kind. Not any longer. Don't be making the argument that this Compact, stripped of the protection for people, now provides people with the protection. 
Section 3.05, Paragraph 6 of the Compact provides that the Compact Commission may enter into an agreement with any person, State, regional body or group of States for importation of low-level radioactive waste. Shall I repeat that, because I have heard it said on the floor of the Senate that this Compact is great because it protects people from becoming a national repository site? Section 3.05, Paragraph 6 of the Compact provides that the Compact Commission may enter into an agreement with any person, State, regional body or group of States for importation of low-level radioactive waste. All it requires is a majority vote of the eight unelected compact commissioners. And the conference committee--and I know the Senators from the States out here were part of this--stripped away the amendment that said it could only come from Texas, Maine or Vermont. 
Mr. President, according to the Texas Observer, March 28, 1997:  
More than two or three national dumps will drive fees so low that profit margins anticipated by States (and now private investors) will be threatened. This economic reality--and growing public resistance to new dumps--has raised the very real possibility that the next dump permitted will be the nuclear waste depository for the whole nation, for decades to come. 
They could very well be right, and you know what? They could not have made that argument about what is about to happen to the people of Sierra Blanca if the conference committee had kept in our amendment. But, no, no. The utility industry, they know what the potential of this is. They didn't want that. The conference committee stripped the House and Senate environmental justice amendments. 
To avoid turning this low-income Mexican-American community into a national depository for radioactive waste, I offered two amendments. The first would have given local residents the chance to prove environmental discrimination in court, and the second, as I have said three times or more, would have limited incoming waste to the States of Texas, Maine and Vermont. My colleagues, in the dark of night in conference committee, decided that it would be a crime to give local residents a chance to prove environmental discrimination in court. And my colleagues, in the dark of night in conference committee, decided that it would be a crime to make sure that we codified in language our claim that the waste would only come from Maine and Vermont and Texas. 
The Senate instructed conferees to insist on these amendments, but the conference ignored the Senate's instructions and stripped them both and that is why Senators should vote against this compact. The conference committee even stripped the amendment limiting the waste to three States, despite the fact that this provision was passed by both the Senate and the House. Mr. President, we have a national responsibility to remedy this injustice, especially since Congress would be complicit in construction of this dump. 
This is not a purely State and local issue. I have heard this argument made: This is a State or local issue; we have no business being involved. Of course we do. We are being asked to vote on it. 
Then this argument that is being made, which I will get to in a moment, is, `Well, wait a moment, there is no waste dump site for sure that has been selected.' Do you know what? If you want to make this argument, why are we pressing for a vote on this compact? It is one of two ways: Either colleagues can come out here and they can say, `You know what? Now these administrative judges have issued a report, and they should have, and what they said is correct saying this is a geologically unstable area. And so maybe, Senator Wellstone, all that you are talking about, about the injustice of this waste dump site being put right on top of a poor Hispanic community, may not happen, because we haven't really decided.' So say some people right now in this debate. I heard it from my colleagues tonight. If that is the case, we shouldn't vote on this yet. Let's wait and see, and then we will know what is in the compact and we will know exactly where this has been sited. 
Or, we have to vote no, because if you vote yes, you are complicit in the construction of this dump. And I want to tell you, the siting process is outrageous. This siting process that took place in Texas is outrageous. It is an affront to anybody's sense of justice. This is not a purely State or local issue, because we have to vote on it. 
For constitutional reasons, the Texas compact cannot take effect without Federal legislation. Senators from all 50 States, not just the compact States, will be asked to give their consent. 
Mr. President, in the El Paso Times of May 28, 1998, Governor Bush said: 
If there's not a Compact in place, we will not move forward. 
In an interview published April 5-11, El Paso, Inc., Governor Bush said: 
The legislation would approve the Compact between Texas, Maine and Vermont. If that does not happen, then all bets are off. 
Moreover, the Texas Legislature has indicated it will not fund construction without the upfront money from the compact. 
The Texas Waste Authority requested over $37 million for fiscal year 1998-1999 for construction of the dump, but the legislature allocated no construction money. They did not appropriate funding for the licensing process and for payments for the host county after the House zeroed out funding for the authority altogether. 
Congress is responsible for this dump. If you will, this dump site has been dumped on the Congress, it has been dumped on the Senate. Construction of the Sierra Blanca dump depends upon the enactment of the conference report to H.R. 629. If the Senate rejects it, Texas will not build a dump in Sierra Blanca. But within 60 days of its enactment, Maine and Vermont will pay Texas $25 million to begin construction. 
We wouldn't even be having this battle if these amendments had been kept in. I wouldn't have liked it. I would have still had questions about this, but I would have thought at least there was some sense of fairness and justice. I want every one of my colleagues to know, you voted, we voted unanimously, to make sure that we made it clear that, indeed, this waste could only come from Maine, Vermont, and Texas, and we voted unanimously that the people should have a right to prove 
discrimination in court. 
But now, that has been taken out in conference committee. So you have the compact without any of the protections for people. You have the compact, with all of its injustice, and it is simple: If you vote against it, then you are voting against Texas building a dump site, a nuclear waste dump site in Sierra Blanca, which is an environmental injustice. If you vote for it, then within 60 days of enactment, Maine and Vermont will pay Texas $25 million to begin construction. If my colleagues want to say, `Paul, we agree this isn't right, what is being done to these people, but you don't know for sure it is going to be this site,' then I say, `Why don't we postpone this vote? Why are you so anxious to ram it through?' 
I heard about other compacts. There are two points. First of all, other compacts, other compacts, fine, but the issue at hand is this compact, this site selection. 
Mr. President, this whole argument about, `Well, we don't really know the specific site,' again, the administrative judge's decision is not binding. That is point No. 1. The Texas environmental agency's Governor appointees are not bound by this at all. They are all appointed by the Governor. They can do whatever they want. The views of this agency, as I said before, which will make the decision, are known. The executive director argued against the hearing officer's recommendation. He said: 
Additional information on `special impact' [i.e., environmental justice] is not needed to make a decision on the license application. The executive director recommends issuance of a license because the applicant has met all the requirements under the law. 
We know what they are going to do. Come on, let's just be direct about this. The Governor's views are known. I have quoted him. 
And then there is the box law. I say to my colleagues, you need to know the specifics of what you are voting on here. The Texas Legislature selected Hudspeth County to host the dump in 1991, and the Texas Waste Authority identified a dump site near Sierra Blanca in 1992. The 1991 box law is still on the books, and regardless of what the TNRCC does, the box law requires that the dump be built in Hudspeth County, which is predominantly Hispanic and poor. 
I want to make that clear--I want to make that clear--that is where it is going to be built, and it is an environmental injustice. It is time we stand up against this kind of injustice. This is not the decision of the people of Maine or the decision of Vermont, but this is what is going to happen. 
Mr. President, this conference report is about nuclear utility rights, not State or local rights. The conference committee followed the wishes of the nuclear utilities, not the local residents. Nuclear utilities who stand to benefit from cheap disposal of nuclear waste strongly supported this legislation without amendments. Local residents, including the local Republican Congressmen, overwhelmingly opposed the dump. 
Of course, the utility industry got their way in conference committee. We know their clout here. They never wanted people anywhere--it is not, in all due respect to the people who are here tonight from Hudspeth County, it is not just you. This industry doesn't want regular citizens anywhere in the country to have a right to prove discrimination. And this industry has big plans for Hudspeth County as a national repository for waste, so they didn't want any amendment making it clear it could only come from Maine or Vermont or Texas. 
Mr. President, I think that I might have said enough for tonight, or maybe not. We will see how the debate goes. I will have tomorrow morning to speak about this as well. 
I have not, in all due respect, heard one argument on the floor of the Senate that is very persuasive. It is just simply not true this compact is all about giving people the protection from being a national repository site. It is simply not true that this is just sort of medical waste from hospitals, it is gloves. It is simply not true this is simply low level so we don't have to worry about it. It is simply not true that this is none of our business. This is a civil rights issue. 
Let me conclude by including some quotes, if I can find them. 
Mr. President, I will do the quotes tomorrow. It is a civil rights issue. That is what this is all about. This is the issue that we have been talking about. As a matter of fact, this is an issue of, every time we are faced with a situation about where a nuclear waste site goes, a dump site goes, or incinerator--and the list goes on and on--then what happens is communities of color, low-income communities, are the ones that are targeted. That is exactly what has happened in Texas. 
We had amendments that would have provided some protection. The Senate went on record. Every Senator supported those amendments, and then they were stripped out of conference committee. That is why Senators should vote against this. 
Mr. President, I just want to make it clear that the League of United Latin American Citizens, LULAC, is adamantly opposed to this. I believe they are going to use this for scoring. That is important. By golly, people in the Latino community ought to hold every Senator accountable for their vote on this. It is a civil rights issue. There is a strong letter from the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in favor of both our amendments which were stripped out of the conference committee in the dark of night. The House Hispanic caucus favored the amendments opposed to this compact, the Texas NAACP, League of Conservation Voters. This is a major issue of justice, and it is a major environmental issue as well. 
I conclude by urging my colleagues to vote against this compact. And on the floor of the Senate tonight and tomorrow morning I will also make an appeal to the administration: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, we need you to speak out on this. You have talked about environmental justice. You have said it is a major priority. What is happening with this compact, what is now being proposed--just think of what this is going to mean for the people who live in Sierra Blanca. If there is ever one example that brings into sharp focus the issue of environmental justice, this is it. We need the President to make it clear that if this should pass, he will veto it. This compact should not pass in its present form. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague that this waste disposal compact is not functional. We have no nuclear waste dump sites that have been chosen. I am not sure how many of these compacts have ever chosen a dump site. I don't know whether my colleague knows the answer to that question. I don't, but I am guessing it's very few, if any. Let me be clear about that. I am not aware that any of these compacts have led to nuclear waste dump sites. If so, I bet it is precious few. 
I'm confused. On the one hand, we hear some discussion on the floor of the Senate about how we look at the selection by this person. Do the people in the community really want this? Then we hear that it may not even be in Hudspeth County. I spent 45 minutes going through the background of this, all the way from when the legislature made the decision in 1991. Of course it is going to be there. I went through all the quotes. Yes, you have some administrative judges. I ask my colleague, if you are convinced that we don't know what the site is yet--and, of course, one difference between this and any other compact is that we didn't have sites before--then why don't we wait for a vote on this until we know where the site is? That would be the best thing to do. That would be a fair thing to do. 
Commissioner John Hall, by the way, in talking about the issue of environmental justice--my colleague says, of course, the people are concerned about this--made it very clear that this issue isn't going to be addressed in the State licensing process. It has not been addressed and will not be before the final license is issued. My colleague may want to think otherwise because it is more comforting, but it is just not the case. 
The commissioners of the Texas administrative agency, TNRCC, which will make the final decision on the Sierra Blanca license, have stated that environmental justice must be addressed at the Federal level because Texas has no clear standards or requirements for evaluating them. Commissioner John Hall explained at a 1995 meeting of the TNRCC, `This whole issue probably needs to be addressed. But it is not this commission's job to articulate a new major policy of that sort. That has to be left to the United States Congress. That is not our job. Our job is to apply the standards as they exist, and while that may be a very legitimate issue, that is not our job.' 
You just can't have it both ways. People in Texas say, and the Commissioner says, `We are not going to be dealing with this issue of environmental justice.' I went through the process. They came across Hudspeth County and moved it away from other sites where people had clout. They have chosen a geologically unstable area. I have all sorts of religious and civil rights organizations who say this discriminates against people in the community who are disproportionately poor or who are Hispanic as well. The executive director of the TNRCC explained in his motion to strike that `environmental justice is not one of the criteria to be considered under the Texas Radiation Control Act or the rules of the TNRCC in the commission's decision whether to license the facility.' They are not looking at that at all. They are saying they can't. They are saying it is up to us. I had two amendments that my colleague from Maine supported--it was unanimous consent, and any Senator who wanted to disagree could have come to the floor and disagreed--which said people ought to at least have a right to prove discrimination if there is discrimination, and let's make sure this only comes from Maine, Vermont and Texas. Both of those amendments, at the wishes of the utility industry, were taken out in committee. 
I am saying to colleagues one more time--vote for this and you just watch. I will bet you every dollar I have, which isn't a lot, if we vote for this compact, that dump site will be located in this Hispanic, low-income community. I will bet you there is not one Senator in here who would want to make a bet with me on that. That is what this is all about. Don't be fooled. The amendments were stripped out. This compact now is a major injustice. It could have been a much better agreement, but somebody--and I don't even know who--decided they wanted to take out these amendments. Now it is up to colleagues in the Senate to vote against this. Otherwise, you will be voting for a major injustice. You will be voting for what I consider to be a violation of the civil rights of the people that live in Hudspeth County. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I have concluded my remarks for tonight.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to say `Happy Birthday' to the Purple Heart. The Purple Heart is the oldest military decoration in the country, and it turns 216 years old on August 7th. 
The Purple Heart honors combat-wounded veterans who have given their blood for their country. It is the only medal which is earned, not awarded. It is earned by being wounded by an enemy during a hostile action toward the United States or an ally. 
I want to thank my friend, Jim Wendt of the Purple Heart in Minnesota, for bringing my attention to this important occasion. The Purple Heart was created by George Washington on August 7, 1782, almost 216 years ago, and the first three medals were awarded during the Revolutionary War. 
On the Purple Heart's 216th birthday, I want to thank Jim and all my friends at the Purple Heart for all their great work. Thank you, and Happy Birthday.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, late last night, the Senate passed by unanimous consent S. 53. I have been contacted by the Attorney General of my State, Hubert H. Humphrey III, and asked to try to clarify a technical legal point about the effect of this legislation. The State of Minnesota, through the office of Attorney General, and the Minnesota Twins are currently involved in an antitrust-related investigation. It is my understanding that S. 53 will have no impact on this investigation or any litigation arising out of the investigation.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you for that clarification. I also note that several lower courts have recently found that baseball currently enjoys only a narrow exemption from antitrust laws and that this exemption applies only to the reserve system. For example, the Florida Supreme Court in Butterworth v. National League, 644 So.2d 1021 (Fla. 1994), the U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania in Piazza v. Major League Baseball, 831 F. Supp. 420 (E.D. Pa. 1993) and a Minnesota State court in a case involving the Twins have all held the baseball exemption from antitrust laws is now limited only to the reserve system. It is my understanding that S. 53 will have no effect on the courts' ultimate resolution of the scope of the antitrust exemption on matters beyond those related to owner-player relations at the major league level.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I am very proud to join with my colleague, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, in offering this amendment. Let me say, second of all, that while we do not agree on all issues--that may be the understatement of the year--we do have a common bond in our very strongly held views and, I think, passion when it comes to human freedom in our country and other countries and respect for human rights. 
At the beginning, I would like to just start out by doing two other things before speaking right to the amendment. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-2-19980730</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I think my colleague from Arkansas will agree with me, it would be important, given this topic, given this debate, given this discussion, to mention Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma, a woman who just wanted to go to a meeting. That repressive junta Government would not let her do so. She spent 5 days in her car, refusing to leave, before she could go to this meeting. She never could get to the meeting. Now she is back safely at home. It reminds us, again, of the repression of this regime. 
I hope that these junta leaders understand that all of us in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, abhor their actions. From my point of view, we can't do enough as a country to isolate that repressive Government. 
The core value that brings my colleague from Arkansas and the Senator from Minnesota together here today is freedom in human rights. I think that there is no better way to speak to this than to examine our relationship with the Government and 1.2 billion people in China. 
I am concerned that the administration's `carrots only' policy has not worked well enough when it comes to accomplishing this goal of promoting freedom in human rights. I believe that the limited steps that the Chinese Government has taken to lessen political persecution or religious persecution has been when there has been American pressure. These included the prospect of a human rights resolution on China at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva and the debate over annual MFN renewal. All of this has been important in communicating a strong statement to this Government that they are under our watchful eye, and that we speak out against persecution against people because of the practice of their religion or of their basic political viewpoint. 
I had reservations, I have reservations about the June summit between the President and President Jiang Zemin. I had hoped that there would be concrete results. I always believed it would have been better if the President had laid out clear human rights preconditions before visiting China. Having said that, I was still very hopeful that this visit would make a difference. I applauded the President speaking out while in China. But always the question was, what next? Will China now take realistic but meaningful steps, such as opening up Tibet to human rights monitors and foreign journalists? Will China release political prisoners? Will they put safeguards in place for the right of free association of workers, beginning a process of abolishing the arbitrary system of reduction through labor? Will they lift their official blacklist of prodemocracy activists now abroad who can't return to China? 
I fear that what we have seen so far by way of agreements announced in Beijing are merely symbolic in nature. On Tuesday, Secretary Albright reported that Chinese dissidents are continuing to be rounded up. For example, last Wednesday the police arrested Zhang Shanguang, a prominent dissident, who had already spent 7 years in jail. What did he do? What was his crime? He tried to organize laid off workers. Also last week, a Chinese court sentenced another dissident to 3 years in prison for helping a fellow activist to escape from China. 
Mr. President, I am all for having good relations with the Government. I am all for making sure that we have economic cooperation. I understand the market that is there. But I join with my colleague, Senator Hutchinson, in introducing this amendment, to say that whatever we do by way of our relations with China, we ought not to sacrifice a basic principle that we hold dear as a country, which is a respect for human rights and for human freedom of peoples. 
This amendment started out to do three things. One will be taken care of in an amendment by my colleague, Senator Abraham, which will increase the number of U.N. diplomats at the Bejing Embassy assigned to monitor human rights and add at least one human rights monitor to each U.S. consulate in this vast country. That is an important amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it. 
The second point I want to make is that our amendment is divided into two parts. First, our amendment will demonstrate our commitment to religious freedom by banning travel to the United States by any Chinese official who has engaged in religious persecution. While membership in religious groups is increasing explosively in China, the Government continues to prosecute, continues to persecute, Muslim Uighurs, Tibetan Buddhists and Christians. 
While harsh prison sentences and violence against religious activists still occur, state control increasingly takes the form of a registration process. This is the way the Government monitors the membership in religious organizations. 
According to the State Department's reports, Chinese officials have conducted a special campaign against all unauthorized religious activities by Christians. This included police detaining people, beating, and fining members of the underground Catholic Church in Jiangxi Province, and raiding the homes of bishops. That is what is happening in this country. 
The Government has also carried out a major purge of local officials in certain heavily Muslim populated areas, and targeted again `underground' Muslim activities. The Government has banned the construction or renovation of 130 mosques, and arrested scores of Muslim dissidents. 
In Tibet, human rights conditions remain grim, and have gotten worse this past year. Tibetan religious activists face `disappearance,' or incommunicado detention, long prison sentences, and brutal treatment in custody. 
Finally, this amendment, second part, demonstrates the abhorrence of the United States over the practice of forced abortion and sterilization. It targets officials involved in forcing Chinese women to undergo abortions and sterilization and bans their travel to the United States of America. Chinese population control officials, working with employers and work unit officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles. They subject women who conceive without Government authorization to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions, including unpayable fines--in one province, twice a family's gross annual income--to loss of employment, and in some cases to the use of physical force. 
Some people argue that we cannot influence China, that the country is too large, too proud, and that change takes too long. I disagree. Religious prosecution, religious persecution, forced sterilization, forced abortion, people trying to speak out on behalf of their own human rights, all of these citizens have thanked us for speaking out; all of the human rights advocates have thanked us for helping to keep them alive by focusing attention on their plight and for fighting for reforms. 
We cannot give up. We must continue to pressure China on these urgent matters. I urge my colleagues to vote for this very reasonable amendment, and I think Senator Hutchinson sends a very compelling and very powerful message, not only to the Government that we will not in any way, shape, or form stand by idly and be silent about this kind of repression, 
but also to the people in China, the citizens, that we support their efforts on behalf of human rights, on behalf of their right to be able to practice their own religion, on behalf of their right to be free from forced abortion and forced sterilization. 
Colleagues, please give this amendment your overwhelming support. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes, because I know my colleague wants to move forward. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Hawaii is the best of the best Senators. I don't like to be in disagreement with him. I am certainly not in disagreement with his analysis about our own history. There is nobody who can speak with more eloquence and more integrity about injustices in our country toward minorities and violations of people's human rights than the Senator from Hawaii. There is no question about it. 
But I also believe, as my colleague from Arkansas has ably pointed out, that it is also important for other countries, and it would have been an important relation for our country to speak out. 
When I think about South Africa, I think about what President Mandela said. One of the things he said over and over again, was when the people in the United States took action, it was when we put the pressure--not just symbolic politics--that things began to break open, and finally we were able to end the awful system of subjugation of people because of the color of their skin. 
When I think even about our relations with the former Soviet Union, we were tough on these human rights violations. 
I really believe that this amendment is just a very modest beginning which says, look, when you have people who are directly guilty of religious persecution, and when you have people who are directly guilty of forced sterilization, forced abortion--and we even had waivers for the Presidents. But what we are saying is then let's take this into account. They ought not to be given travel visas to our country. 
This is moderate, I say to my colleagues. This is but a step forward. But it sends such a powerful and important message about what our values are all about, what we are about as a nation. And it supports the people in China. This really is an important amendment. I hope that our colleagues will vote for it and will give it overwhelming support.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. 
Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, the Fair Labor Organizing Act, to strengthen the basic rights of workers freely to associate, organize and to join a union. The bill would address significant shortcomings in the National Labor Relations Act. These shortcomings amount to impediments to one of the most fundamental ways that working people can seek to improve their own and their families' standard of living and quality of life, which is to join, belong to and participate in a union. 
Mr. President, in the past few years, working men and women across the country have been fighting and organizing with a new energy. They are fighting for better health care, pensions, a living wage, better education policy and fairer trade policy. They also are fighting and organizing to ensure that they have the opportunity to be represented by a union through which they can collectively bargain with their employers. Much of this organizing is taking place among sectors of the workforce, and among portions of our working population, that have not previously been organized. I think these new efforts are part of what really is a new civil rights and human rights struggle in our country. It is an important and positive historical development. There is probably no clearer indication that the impact of this development is being felt, and that many of these efforts are succeeding, than some of the attacks in the current Congress on unions representing the country's working people. 
Why have we seen so many bills with Orwellian titles such as the TEAM Act, which has little to do with employer-employee teamwork and a lot more to do with company-dominated labor organizations? Such as the `Family Friendly Workplace Act,' which really isn't family friendly, but would reduce working families' pay and undercut the 40-hour workweek? Such as the so-called SAFE Act, which doesn't promote safety but actually would roll back well-established and necessary OSHA protections? 
Why does the majority in Congress seem so desperate to single out unions to suppress their political activities at the same time they maneuver to kill genuine political campaign finance reform? 
It is because unions are succeeding. That is a good thing because in my view, when organized labor fights for job security, for dignity, justice and for a fair share of America's prosperity, it is not a struggle merely for their own benefit. The gains of unionized workers on basic bread and butter issues are key to the economic security of all working families. 
How can it be that as many as 10,000 Americans lose their jobs each year for supporting union organizing when the National Labor Relations Act already supposedly prohibits the firing of an employee to deny his or her right to freely organize or join a union? If more than four in 10 workers who are not currently in a union say they would join one if they had the opportunity, why aren't there more opportunities? Since we know that union workers earn up to one-third more than non-union workers and are more likely to have pensions and health benefits, why aren't more workers unionized when the new labor movement is correctly focused on organizing? 
The answer to these basic questions is this: we need labor law reform. We need to improve the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). 
The Fair Labor Organizing Act would achieve three basic goals. First, it would help employees make fully informed, free decisions about union representation. Second, it would expand the remedies available to wrongfully discharged employees. Third, it would require mediation and arbitration when employers and employees fail to reach a collective bargaining agreement on their own. 
It is late in the current Congress. My bill may not receive full consideration or be enacted into law this year. But I believe it is important to set a standard and place a marker. Workers across America are fighting for their rights, and many are finding that the playing field is tilted against them. The NLRA does not fully allow them fair opportunity to speak freely, to associate, organize and join a union, even though that is its intended purpose. I have walked some picket lines during the past two years. I have joined in solidarity with workers seeking to organize. I have called on employers to bargain in good faith with their employees during disputes. I intend to continue doing so, and I urge colleagues to do the same. At the same time, it is clear to nearly any organizer and to many workers who have sought to join a union that the rules in crucial ways are stacked against them. My bill seeks to address that fact. 
First, it is a central tenet of U.S. labor policy that employees should be free to make informed and free decisions about union representation. Yet, union organizers have limited access to employees while employers have unfettered access. Employers have daily contact with employees. They may distribute written materials about unions. They may require employees to attend meetings where they present their views on union representation. They may talk to employees one-on-one about how they view union representation. On the other hand, union organizers are restricted from worksites and even public areas. 
If we want people to make independent, informed decisions about whether they should be represented by a union, then we have to give them equal access to both sides of the story. This bill would amend the National Labor Relations Act to provide equal time to labor organizations to provide information about union representation. Equal time. That means that an employer would trigger the equal time provision that this bill would insert into the NLRA by expressing opinions on union representation during work hours or at the worksite. The provision would give a union equal time to use the same media used by the employer to distribute information, and would allow the union access to the worksite to communicate with employees. 
The second reform in the bill would toughen penalties for wrongful discharge violations. It would require the National Labor Relations Board to award back pay equal to 3 times the employee's wages when the Board finds that an employee is discharged as a result of an unfair labor practice. It also would allow employees to file civil actions to recover punitive damages when they have been discharged as a result of an unfair labor practice. 
Third, the bill would put in place mediation and arbitration procedures to help employers and employees reach mutually agreeable first-contract collective bargaining agreements. It would require mediation if the parties cannot reach agreement on their own after 60 days. Should the parties not reach agreement 30 days after a mediator is selected, then either party could call in the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for binding arbitration. I believe that this proposal represents a balanced solution--one that would help both parties reach agreements they can live with. It gives both parties incentive to reach genuine agreement without allowing either side to indefinitely hold the other hostage to unrealistic proposals. 
Mr. President, this bill would be a step toward fairness for working families in America. The proposals are not new. I hope my colleagues will support the bill.

I was on a show this morning, WCCO Radio, in Minnesota. It is hard to explain to farmers why we can't take the action right now on the indemnity payment, the $500 million. We passed it. The correction would be made later on, but we can get assistance to farmers right now.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let the Record show I am speaking for myself, but let the Record show that there was no objection to moving forward on advance payments for this `freedom to fail' bill, which is just an admission what an awful piece of legislation it was on our side. In addition, we could have gotten a $500 million indemnity payment out to farmers. 
People are asking, when are we going to see this assistance? People are thinking about a lifetime of 2 months or 3 months. 
I hear this discussion that we need to take a broader view, it needs to go over to the House, and we need to work it in conference committee, and we haven't had a chance to meet yet in conference committee. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds to the people whom we represent? 
Mr. President, I will just say I don't think it is just that simple. Obviously, I am not going to change the course of events tonight. 
My colleague from Iowa came out here earlier and spoke about this. First, the minority leader asked whether or not we also could have unanimous consent to get this indemnity payment out to the countryside, out to families in rural America. Then the Senator from Iowa spoke about it. Then the Senator from North Dakota comes to the floor, after we have agreed to go forward--fast forward the advance payments was just fine with this Freedom to Farm bill. And now we come out and the Senator from North Dakota asks unanimous consent that we get the $500 million--when did we pass that? I ask my colleagues.

Mr. WELLSTONE. A month ago. We get this out now, over to the House of Representatives; they take action this week or next week; and then we get the assistance out to farmers. 
And what I hear on this side is this chorus of `No,' and then everyone leaves. With all due respect, it is not that simple. I want the farmers in Minnesota and I want the farmers across the country to know that there was an effort made tonight to get some additional help to people above and beyond these advance payments, which will help only a little. 
It is a desperate situation. Many people are going to go under over the next several months. There was an effort tonight to get $500 million passed, over to the House, and out to farmers all across the country, especially in those areas that have been hardest hit. And my colleagues on the other side said no. And they are gone. 
I will be willing to yield in 1 second. I would like to speak a little bit more about this for another 3 minutes. It is not that simple. I will just say to my colleagues on the other side, I see that it is late at night, but I will just say to them, it is not as simple as saying no. You said no to a proposal, to an effort to get assistance to people now. We could have done it. We have done it. 
I think the Record should be very clear. I want every single farm family in northwest Minnesota that is in desperate shape to know that this proposal was turned down by the Republican Party--unwilling to do it. We were more than willing to help out a little bit with moving forward on the advance payments. No reciprocation or cooperation on the other side in getting the $500 million out to people right now. 
I don't think it will be very easy to explain to people why we are waiting another month. I don't know whether we should have even left. It is sort of interesting to me, a bitter irony. Now we are gone. We probably shouldn't have gone. We probably shouldn't be going into recess. 
How do you say to people, well, it will be in a conference committee and we haven't quite got that together and we just didn't want to do it tonight because there are some things that I am not satisfied with as a Senator and I would like to work on that longer? 
The future is now for people. Time is not neutral. We could have passed something which would have provided $500 million to farmer families that are in real trouble, and we didn't do it. I am embarrassed that we are going into recess. I am embarrassed that the U.S. Senate blocked this. I am embarrassed, specifically, that my Republican colleagues blocked it. 
I didn't get a chance to talk earlier because the majority leader tried to move things along, said he would recognize two Senators, and the Senator from Georgia was the last Senator. So now I get to speak. I think it is just outrageous. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased we are about to pass this important conference report. I look forward to its enactment upon signature by the President, which I hope can occur very soon. It is my understanding that the House is prepared to act on the conference bill during the coming days. 
I have spoken on numerous occasions regarding the subject. As the Ranking Democrat on the Senate Labor Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I have worked hard with my colleagues Senator DeWine, Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy to help bring us to where we are this evening. I thank them and the many Minnesotans who have worked directly with me and my staff during the months of hearings, preparations, debate and drafting. 
The conference bill preserves important policy principles contained in the Senate bill. It will help coordinate, streamline and decentralize our federal job training system. At the same time, it will make that system more accountable to real performance measures. It gives private sector employers--the people who have jobs to offer and who need workers with the right skills--a greater role in directing policy at the state and local level, which is where most decision-making power resides in this bill. The bill retains crucial federal priorities, then allows state and local authorities to decide how best to address their needs. 
And it will move the country to where Minnesota and a number of other states have already moved decisively: to a system of One-Stop service centers where people can get all the information they need in one location. It will replace currently over-bureaucratized systems in many states and localities with systems driven more by the needs of those who utilize them. Adults seeking training will receive Individual Training Accounts to give them direct control over their own careers. High quality labor market information will be accessible through the One-Stops, and training providers will be required to report publicly on their performance. Men and women will have the ability to make their own choices based on the best information about which profession they should pursue, about the skills and training they'll need, and about the best place to get those skills and that training. 
This week in Minneapolis, concluding today, the U.S. Department of Labor and Minnesota's Department of Economic Security hosted a national conference on One-Stop Workforce centers. It is with some pride that I note that my state has been a real leader in innovation with respect to One-Stops. Minnesota has also been a national leader when it comes to workforce system performance. 
The conference bill ensures that states such as Minnesota, and the localities within them, can continue to innovate within the new system created. Good-performing service delivery areas will be allowed to continue to perform successfully. The same is true of current collaborative one-stop structures and local workforce boards which currently successfully undertake a range of activities, such as what the bill calls core services and training services. We have intentionally built flexibility into the bill. 
Veterans will be served both in State-administered training programs and the national veterans workforce investment programs. Veterans also will have a strong role in the policy processes established in the bill. Community-based organizations are assured an appropriate role in setting policy. Labor organizations, too, retain a prominent role. Crucial provisions regarding the federal employment service are protected. 
Mr. President, it has been a very busy week. I have given longer speeches on this topic in the past and may yet again. For now, I am extremely satisfied with our accomplishment in this bill. I hope we will soon be able to celebrate its enactment.

It applies to the Congress and not just to the administration. Furthermore, what my amendment says is that when the Congress prepares its report on family well-being --which I think is a real important concept; I think it is something that we should be about--the Congress also reports on the impact of our legislation on children. 
The amendment doesn't strike the Abraham amendment. It expands on the amendment. I believe that my colleagues, if I am given a little bit of time, will want to support this. 
Mr. President, I think the reason when we pass legislation out of committee, that in our report language we need to talk about the impact of children, is because of the reality of the lives of children in America. Part of our definition of family well-being, surely, has to do with parents, and we ought to make sure that parents are able to do their very best by their children, because when parents do their very best by their children, they do their very best by our country. It is also true if we are going to talk about parents, we have to talk about the impact of our legislation on children. 
Mr. President, one out of every four children in our country under the age of 3 is growing up poor. One in three children will be poor at some point in their childhood. One in five children today under the age of 6 is poor today in America. One in three is a year or more behind in school. One in four children is born to a mother who did not graduate from high school. One out of every four children lives with only one parent. One out of every five children lives in a family receiving food stamps. One out of every five children is born to a mother who received no prenatal care in the first 3 months of her pregnancy. One out of every seven children have no health insurance. One out of every eight children are born to teenage children. One out of every 12 children has a disability. One out of every 13 children is born at low birthweight. One out of every 25 children lives with neither parent. One out of every 132 children in America dies by the age of 1. And 1 in 680 children is killed by gunfire before the age of 20. 
Let me do it a different way as to why I believe when we pass legislation we ought to talk about the impact of this legislation on children, and we ought to make it clear.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I will say to my colleagues, if I don't get order, I will talk for a long time about this, because I don't think there is anything inappropriate about having a focus on the state of children in America. 
So I hope that we can have order in the Chamber and I will be able to go on. I will take as long as necessary. 
Mr. President, every day in America, one mother dies in child birth. Every day in America, three people under the age of 25 die from HIV infection. Every day in America, six children or young people commit suicide. Every day in America, 13 children and youths are murdered. Every day in America, 16 children and youths are killed by firearms. Every day in America, 36 children and youths die from accidents. Every day in America, 81 babies die. Every day in America, 144 babies are born at very low birth weight. Every day in America, 311 children are arrested for alcohol offenses. Ever day in America, 316 children are arrested for violent crime. Every day in America, 403 children are arrested for drug offenses. Every day in America, 443 babies are born to mothers who receive late or no prenatal care. Every day in America, 781 babies are born at low birth weight. Every day in America, 1,403 babies are born to mothers younger than 20. Every day in America, 2,377 babies are born to mothers who are not high school graduates. Every day in America, 2,556 children--babies--are born into poverty. Every day in America, 3,356 young people drop out of high school. 
Colleagues, when I cite these figures from the Children's Defense Fund Report of this summer--this last report was July 17, 1998. When I cite the statistics that every day in America 3,356 high school students drop out, there is a higher correlation between high school dropouts and winding up in prison than between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Surely, we ought to be looking at the state of children in America. 
Mr. President, one quarter of all the homeless people in America are children under the age of 18, and 100,000 of these kids live on the streets right now. Mr. President, 5.5 million children go hungry in the United States of America today. 
Mr. President, I commend my colleague for his emphasis on families. I commend my colleague for wanting to say that we want to do everything we can to enable parents to do well by their children. I want to commend my colleague for making the point that we want to make sure that parents are really able to exercise their responsibilities as parents with their children. 
But I also want to say something else to my colleagues, which is that this second-degree amendment adds a lot of strength to what is on the floor. I don't think there should be any vote against this, because what the second-degree amendment says is, let's also apply this to the Congress. We simply say that whatever we vote out of committee, we also, in report language, have a very careful child impact statement. I see my colleague from Connecticut on the floor--probably the leading Senator for years when it comes to focusing on children. I say to my colleague, I think this is really an excellent idea. I think it is important for us to be looking at the impact. 
Mr. President, I have one question that I can't let go of in my own mind, which I pose for every single colleague here: How can it be that right now in the United States of America, at our peak economic performance, we have one out of every four children under the age of 3 growing up poor in our country, and one out of every two children of color growing up poor in our country today? This is the most affluent country in the world, the most powerful country in the world, with record low unemployment, record economic performance, low inflation, a celebrated GDP, and we have a set of social arrangements that allow children to be the poorest group of Americans in our country. That is a national disgrace. 
Now, Mr. President, I just want to go on and make one other point. In some of the debate that we have had over the years, colleagues have said, look, all right, Senator Wellstone, you disagree about proposed cuts in affordable housing, or Head Start; you disagree with proposed cuts in the Food Stamp Program, which is the major safety net food and nutrition program for children in America; you disagree with some of our other priorities, but we want to tell you that in no way, shape, or form are we not committed to children in America. I accept that in good faith. But what I want to say tonight is that, if so, we ought to at least be willing to look at our actions. We ought to be willing to look at our legislation, and we ought to be willing to analyze the impact on children in America. 
Mr. President, I have traveled not just in Minnesota, but in our country, and the one thing that troubles me the most is, I just think we have to do a lot better for kids, a lot better for kids in our country. 
We talk about low SAT scores; that is there. We talk about high rates of high school dropouts; that is there. We talk about children being arrested for substance abuse; that is happening. We talk about too many children taking their own lives; that is happening. We talk about too many children that are murdered; that is happening. We talk about too much violence in our schools; that is happening. We talk about too many hungry children in America; that is happening. We talk about too many children that are 3 and 4 years old and are home alone because the single parent is working and because there is no child care; that is happening. Second graders and first graders come home alone with no parent there, sometimes in very dangerous neighborhoods; that is happening. We talk about the poverty in our country and the number of children that are homeless children. 
I say to the Chair, because of his commitment to veterans, that one of the most disgraceful things going on in our country is that about one-third of all the homeless are veterans--many Vietnam veterans. That is a scandal; that is simply unconscionable. 
But the fact of the matter is that all of us say that we are for the children. All of us say that they are 100 percent of our future. All of us say that we care about children. All of us want to have our pictures taken next to children. All of us say that we are parents and grandparents and that this is our commitment. Well, I am saying that Senator Abraham has brought a good piece of legislation on the floor. He wants to talk about the importance of parental responsibility. He wants to talk about the importance of families. And what I believe is that this second-degree amendment expands on his work, and I certainly hope that this amendment will be accepted by my colleagues. 
Mr. President, I know there is a lot that we are trying to do tonight, and I have a lot more to say. In deference to colleagues--the majority leader has been gracious enough to come over here and say that this amendment will be accepted. 
I just say to colleagues that, if so, I am delighted, I say to the Senator from Colorado. Might I ask my colleague one thing?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Knowing of the commitment of the Senator from Colorado and just sort of knowing the way things work here, I wonder whether I could ask my colleague something. I am sort of tempted to have a vote because I would like to show a lot of support for this. I ask my colleague whether or not he would be willing to fight hard to keep this in conference committee? 
I know my friend from Colorado being an honorable Senator--I am delighted that it will be taken--I am wondering whether my colleague would give me some sense of whether or not he supports this, whether I can count on his support in the conference committee so this doesn't get taken out.

There is another amendment that should be added to the list that will deal with mental health or substance abuse as it affects Federal employees. I would like to have 20 minutes equally divided on that.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I guess what I will say on the floor of the Senate, in part, is an effort to speak to the families of Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson, but I guess it is also an effort on my part not only to speak to their families, but also to speak to the Capitol Hill Police. 
Early Monday morning, Sheila, my wife, and I were walking from our apartment, which is near the Hart Senate Office Building, over to the doctor's office. Usually that takes about 7 minutes. It took about 40 minutes because of all of the officers who we ran into and all of the embraces, the hugs and the tears, just the embrace of real pain that people feel. 
I want to say--I don't really have any words--this is a very, very sad day in Washington, DC, but I want to say to all of the Capitol Hill Police that all of us in the Senate--but I am now speaking for myself as a Senator from Minnesota--want you to know of our love and our support. We want Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson's families to know that their husbands and fathers, sons, brothers were so courageous. I wish personally that there is something I can do to change everything. I wish that none of this had happened. It is horrifying. It seems senseless. 
They were two wonderful men. I only knew them to say hello. I know the Capitol Police much better on the Senate side. It never should have happened, but these men deserve all of our praise. Their families deserve all of our love and support. 
Especially as a U.S. Senator, I say to the other police officers--I guess that is mainly the one thing I want to do today--I want them to know how much I appreciate what they do. I want them to know how sorry I am that this happened. I want them to know that I hope and pray it will never happen again. And I want all of my colleagues to know, Democrats and Republicans alike, that I think today we are all together. Everybody can feel this, everybody can understand this, and I think probably the best thing we can do in memory of two very brave police officers is to understand how precious each day is, understand how precious people are, understand how important life is, appreciate the people who help us and go out of our way to make sure we live our lives in the most honest way possible. 
To the Capitol Hill Police, thank you for some of you being really great friends to Sheila and me. I know how much pain you are in, but please know that you have our support.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is hard to do justice to the topic in 5 minutes. 
Let me say I think something is happening on the floor of the Senate that takes us backward as a nation. There have been many people that have given their sweat and tears and even blood to try and improve conditions for farm workers. There have been Senators in the past that have done that. This amendment really undercuts some of this very important work. 
What we are saying in this amendment is essentially this: We are saying to the growers, listen, you don't have to really worry about the market. If the growers can't find the workers, pay better wages and have better working conditions. How many more reports do we have to have, from Harvest of Shame, to reports today of working conditions? The wages and uncivilized working conditions of farm workers are a national disgrace. If the growers want to have people working for them, then just have civilized working conditions and decent wages. 
What this amendment essentially says is that what we are going to do is actually add to the exploitation by enabling you growers to essentially rely on a new guest worker program. Mr. President, we don't need a new guest worker program. Senator Kennedy talked about the GAO report. I heard the farm worker justice fund mentioned earlier. They don't talk about this as reform; they talk about it as deform. We have a very strange situation here. We are saying that the growers can't get the workers, and now what we have is a program that cuts payments for guest workers. This cuts the payments for the guest workers. So in order to attract more workers, we enable growers to rely on people coming in from other countries, and we cut their wages. 
I don't call this reform. I don't call this a change for the better. What we are essentially doing is putting the Federal Government at the service of a sector--in this particular case the growers--as a source of cheap labor. It is a huge mistake. Now, if we want to do better by way of working conditions for legal workers, I am all for it. If we want to reform the Guest Worker Program, I am all for it. But that is not what this is about. This is a huge step backward. 
I hear about the vouchers. I mean, I did a lot of organizing in rural communities. The question is whether there is any housing. What good does it do to have vouchers if there isn't adequate housing there? We no longer deal with that protection. Then, in addition, the three-fourths minimum work guarantee is eliminated. 
Workers who used to travel long distances are now promised wages for at least three-fourths of the season for which they are being hired. That guarantee is no longer there. This essentially takes the Guest Worker Program backwards. It adds to exploitation. It undercuts the working conditions of farm workers, which are already atrocious in this country. I say to the growers, with all due respect, if you want to have more people working for you, pay decent wages, have civilized working conditions. We ought not to be asking the Federal Government to essentially move in and supply these growers with a form of cheap labor, exploited labor. This isn't reform, this is deform. I hope there will be a strong vote against it.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a provision contained in the Commerce/Justice/State Appropriations bill: `Grants to Combat Violent Crime Against Women on Campuses,' which provide $10 million a year to the Department of Justice for dissemination to colleges. I want to thank Senator Gregg, the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State, for working with me to ensure that this provision becomes law. 
In the 1980s, several high profile violent crimes on campuses raised concern about campus crime and security, resulting in the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act (C.S.A.) in 1990. Though overall crime rates are declining, sexual assaults throughout the United States, including on college campuses, are on the rise. Studies tell us: 
Twenty percent of college-aged women will be victims of sexual assault at some point during their college careers. 
According to a 1995 study, 82 percent of rapes or sexual assaults in 1992-93 involved a person the victim knew. 
Rape remains the most under reported violent crime in America, with approximately 1 in 6 rapes reported to police. 
I am very concerned about sexual assault on college campuses. A 1991 survey of more than 6,000 college students found that 42 percent of women students reported some form of sexual assault, including forcible sexual contact, attempted rape, and completed rape. This is simply unacceptable and we must do something to turn this around. 
We have already taken an important step in addressing violence on campuses. Already included in the Higher Education Act are efforts to strengthen reporting so that we can get more accurate statistics and a national baseline study has been commissioned to look at the policies and procedures regarding sexual assault, and how effective they are. 
That's a great start, but it's not enough. It's not enough to simply get better statistics. It's not enough to look at how sexual assaults are dealt with on campuses. We have to go further. We have to combat sexual assault on campuses. We have to end the violence. Even one victim of sexual assault is too many. 
A critical component to addressing violence against women on campus is good collaboration among those who work with victims of sexual assault--campus police, local law enforcement, campus administrators, and victim services. We need to improve the coordinated response to violence on campuses. We need consistent enforcement and implementation of policies regarding sexual assault. We need enhanced communication between the campus and local community. 
And in turn, this increased communication will result in more accurate statistics. According to a GAO report released last March, one of the reasons we don't have good statistics is that campuses have had trouble deciding how to include crimes reported to campus officials who are not campus police. It's not unusual for crimes on campus to be reported to local police and not reported in campus crime reports. Improving collaboration within and between campus and off-campus agencies will improve the statistics--and therefore give us a more realistic picture of violence on campuses. It will also improve services and care for victims. 
The grant program we've created--Grants to Combat Violent Crime Against Women on Campuses--would make $10 million a year available to college campuses so that campus personnel and student organizations could work with campus administrators and police. The aim is to improve security and investigation methods to combat violence against women on campus and to improve victim services. These efforts may include partnerships with local criminal justice folks and community victim services organizations. Collaborating with community resources is especially critical when campuses have minimal victim support services and students are isolated from community support systems. 
Some say, `Why do this federally? Shouldn't schools do this themselves?' But why should we be surprised that schools have yet to properly initiate these collaborations when communities haven't even started. We need to hold the line on violence everywhere, in schools and in communities. And the only way to overcome violence involves setting up collaborative programs, and that takes funds. That's what the federal government does when it is functioning best--get the ball rolling. 
Campus safety is an educational access issue. Violence on campus is a huge barrier to education for many students who are in fear of being attacked because they feel unprotected on their own campuses. Without adequate prevention and protection services, many students--women in particular--continue to become victims of attacks, while others remain afraid to take night classes or to study late at the library. And victims of sexual assault may choose to leave school because they feel unprotected. 
How are college women supposed to focus on their educations when one out of five college women will be a victim of sexual assault? And if it's not themselves personally, it will surely be their roommates, their classmates, their sorority sisters, or their friends. College is the time when many young people begin to break away from the protection of their families, a time of learning--both in the classroom and out--a time of freedom. But for many young women, it's also a time of trauma, a time of victimization, a time of violence. It's time to make campuses safe. 
During the Higher Education Act Markup in the Senate, I reached a public agreement with Senator Gregg to work together to develop a Campus Safety Collaborative Grant Program. On May 6th, Senator Gregg agreed to the language I proposed, creating a $10 million grant program administered by the Department of Justice for collaborative grants to colleges in order to combat violence on campus. Consequently, the Senate Working Group--Senator Jeffords, Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd--adopted the language into the Manager's Substitute of the Higher Education Act. And I am very pleased that Senator Gregg has inserted funding for this program into the Commerce/State/Justice Appropriations Bill. 
The Wellstone/Gregg Collaborative Grant Program states: `enough is enough. It's time to end the violence.' I thank Senator Gregg for all of his efforts, and I urge my colleagues to support this important provision.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the attention of colleagues a disturbing set of circumstances and facts which I believe merit investigation and probably legislative action on the part of the Senate. I also believe that the facts I am about to discuss warrant more attention than they have received so far from the Justice Department. 
There is evidence of significant violation of Federal law leading to great harm. I hope that in addition to the Congress responding appropriately, the Justice Department might look further into this matter. 
I am referring to what appears to be a record of widespread systematic cheating on occupational air quality tests by operators of many of our Nation's coal mines. This alleged cheating, of which there appears to be nearly incontrovertible evidence, apparently has led to much unnecessary suffering in thousands of American families. 
It likely also has led to the unnecessary death from black lung disease of thousands of American coal miners. 
Unfortunately, I am not referring to conditions that existed early in this century, or even conditions of the 1950s or 1960s. I'm talking about circumstances of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. I'm talking about allegations related to existing conditions and practices in American coal mines today.

Mr. WELLSTONE. That is the newspaper of Louisville, KY. 
This remarkable series of five articles, principally by a reporter named Gardiner Harris, is titled `Dust, Deception and Death.' The series documents an apparent pattern of falsification of coal dust sampling tests by coal mine operators and it details the consequences of that dishonesty: unnecessary suffering and early death for American coal miners. 
It is an extraordinary report. I do not believe it has received enough attention, although hearings have been taking place at the state level in Kentucky to look into the charges. 
The paper conducted a year-long investigation. Hundreds of current and former miners were interviewed. More than 7 million government records were examined. Based on that research, the Courier-Journal's reporters concluded that cheating on air-quality tests in coal mines has contributed to great suffering and to a large number of deaths from black lung disease among American coal miners. Their reporting reveals that the Federal Government, at least until very recently, largely ignored readily observable indications of that cheating. 
I do not draw absolute conclusions at this time from what is reported in the Courier-Journal. But I can say that what is reported in this series is consistent with what I saw and heard when I visited with miners in Eastern Kentucky a year ago. I was told then that cheating goes on in the dust sampling program in American coal mines. And I heard from sick and dying miners and their families about the connection between coal-mine conditions and black lung disease--especially in non-union mines. 
We in the Federal Government have a responsibility to these workers and their families. At the end of my statement, I will make some suggestions regarding actions I believe we should take in the Senate. And I hope that colleagues, as they become more aware of this situation, might add to those suggestions and help determine the most appropriate response to what I believe is a national shame. 
The initial shame is that the suffering and death of thousands of Americans appears to be the direct result of systematic cheating on a government-monitored health-protection program. The deeper shame is that we in the Federal Government have had the opportunity to know it, yet so far we haven't done very much about it. Dedicated people in the appropriate Federal agency, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), are beginning to address this problem. J. Davitt McAteer, who is the Assistant Secretary for MSHA, has begun during recent years to take a number of steps, and he has called for further steps beyond those he has taken. But we still are not doing enough.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment--and I thank both Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg for their support--that would allow States to use Federal prison construction moneys for mental health treatment in our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections facilities--allow States; States make that decision. 
I am a Senator from the State of Minnesota. Hubert Humphrey, a great Senator from Minnesota, once said: 
The moral test of government is how the government treats those who are in the dawn of life, children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life --the sick, the needy, and the handicapped. 
Today, throughout America, we are failing the moral test of how we treat adults and children. I want to focus on children in mental health, in the criminal and juvenile justice system, too many of whom live in the shadow of mental illness. 
According to a recent article in the New York Times by Fox Butterfield--this was a front page piece. The title of it is `Profits at a Juvenile Prison Come With a Chilling Cost.'

Mr. WELLSTONE. Almost 200,000 people behind bars in the United States of America, according to Mr. Butterfield, are known to suffer from schizophrenia, manic-depression, or major depression--the three most severe mental illnesses. This rate is four times greater than for the general population. And there is strong evidence, particularly among juveniles, that their numbers in the jails are growing. 
The vast majority of these people, colleagues, have not committed serious violent crimes. Some are homeless people charged with minor crimes that are a byproduct of their mental illness. They just get swept up and incarcerated. Others are picked up with no charges at all, in what police call `mercy arrests,' simply for acting strange. 
Jails and prisons often find themselves unprepared to deal with the mentally ill. For instance, medication may not be properly monitored or guards do not know how to respond to disturbed inmates who are simply not capable of standing in an orderly line for meals. A common result is that these inmates find themselves in solitary confinement. 
Colleagues, 200 years ago the most common treatment for the seriously mentally ill was jail. Thousands of people with severe disorders were brutally locked away and forgotten. This did not change until Dorothy Dix, and other reformers in the middle of the last century, successfully fought to have these people transferred form jails to hospitals. 
I fear that our jails are once again becoming dumping grounds for ill people who need treatment and care and that as a result we are recriminalizing the mentally ill in America today. 
On July 1, Mr. President, I went with the National Mental Health Association to the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth. Mr. President, I want to just briefly summarize this trip and then focus on mental health and children. 
First of all--and I have talked with my colleagues from Louisiana who care a great deal about this. Let me say that, in particular, the warden, David Bonnette, is very committed to trying to make the changes. 
I went there because I had seen some preliminary Justice Department reports that essentially said there were kids who really had not committed any crimes--by the way, the vast majority of children, over 90 percent in the juvenile corrections system, have not committed violent crime. But I heard that there were kids who had been dumped in this facility--but the same can be said for other facilities in our country--who had not committed any violent crimes. Some had not committed any crime. And then, to make matters worse, there is no medication, no counseling, and there they are. It is unconscionable. 
I went to visit this facility. When I got there, I first met with people in the administrative building. A lot of officials from Louisiana were there, quite a bit of media was there--journalists, TV, radio. But forget all that. 
We had some initial negotiations because I wanted to visit where the solitary confinement cells were. I wanted to find out why kids were put in these cells for up to 6 or 7 weeks at a time, up to maybe 23 hours a day--if my colleagues are listening. I wanted to find out why. 
Before visiting there, we first went to a building where these kids--and they are kids from age 11 to age 18--were eating. I say to my colleague from South Carolina, he might be interested in this. Again, I am not trying to point the finger of blame, but I saw these kids eating, and probably 85 percent of them were black, African American, ages 11 to 18. There are 500-plus kids in this facility. 
I went over to where some of these kids were eating, and I said, `How are you doing?' And this one kid said, `Not so good.' I said, `What do you mean?' He said, `This food, they never serve this food. They just did this for today. We don't ever get this kind of food. These clothes, we never had these clothes. Every day it's the same clothes. Every day it's the same underwear. It's hot. There's no air conditioning. And we don't have any clothes like this, clean clothes. These shoes, we never had any shoes like this. Smell the paint on the table. These tables have all been freshly painted. This is just a show for you, Senator.' 
Then I turned to officials from Louisiana, and I never heard them contradict that. Again, I am going to end up very much in the positive about what I think is going to happen now. 
And then we walked across the compound--that is what I will call it--because I wanted to get to where these solitary confinement cells were. And this one young man climbs up on a roof, leaps up on a roof, and runs toward me and a whole lot of people who are with me. And I said to him, `You're going to get in a lot of trouble. Why are you doing this?' He said, `I want to make a statement.' I said, `What is your statement?' He said, `This is a show. And we're all going to get beaten up when you leave. 
We get beaten up all the time.' 
Then I met with four young guys. One had stolen a moped. That is why he was there. One was there for breaking and entering, and another was breaking and entering. The point is, they talked about being beaten up all the time. 
Now, the Justice Department has also chronicled some of these conditions. The truth of the matter is, I believe the warden there and the State of Louisiana knows that things have to change. That is the good news, I hope. There has now been a civil rights lawsuit filed. There is a tremendous amount of interest. 
What I want to say to colleagues, and I believe this Fox Butterfield article was terribly important as well, but I want to just simply talk about some of what I observed, regarding the mental health in children. One hallucinating child was in isolation for observation, yet his transfer to an appropriate mental health facility was uncertain. Another child I met was taking three different types of powerful psychiatric medications but had only seen a psychiatrist twice in the last 8 months. The Justice Department chronicled instances where boys were being repeatedly sexually and physically abused, and children with mental illness were being housed with youths who had committed violent crimes--mentally ill children who had received no therapy, and when they are having the symptoms they are often isolated or punished for their illness. 
Mr. President, I just say that what is happening to these troubled children who were dumped in these facilities and get no care, many of whom shouldn't be there in the first place, is a national tragedy. All across our country we are dumping emotionally disturbed kids into juvenile prisons. Each year more than 1 million youth come in contact with the juvenile justice system, and more than 100,000 of these youth are detained in some type of jail or prison. These children are overwhelmingly poor, and a disproportionate number of them are children of color. 
By the time many of these children are arrested and incarcerated, they have a long history of problems in their short lives. As many as two-thirds suffer from mental or emotional disturbances. One in five has a serious disorder. Many have substance abuse problems and learning disabilities, and most of them come from troubled homes. 
Tallulah is not the only offending facility. The Justice Department has exposed gross abuses in Georgia, Kentucky, and other juvenile facilities all across our country. Other States are experiencing similar problems. Investigators found extreme cases of physical abuse and neglected mental health needs, including unwarranted and prolonged isolation of suicidal children who are hog-tied, and chemical restraints are used on youth with serious emotional disturbances, as well as forced medication and even denial of medication. Children with extensive psychiatric histories who are prone to self-mutilation never even saw a psychiatrist. This is a Justice Department report, Justice Department findings on conditions in our juvenile `correction' facilities. 
Mr. President, our current system fails mentally ill adults and children. The screening and treatment of mental and emotional disturbances are inadequate or nonexistent at correctional facilities. Mental illness typically is addressed solely through discipline, isolation, and restraint. At Tallulah, children told us they were beaten and put in isolation for long periods, even months, echoing in painful detail what has been revealed in the Justice Department reports. 
The tragedy of this situation is that we know what works--treatment. But our current system for adults and children with mental illness favors punishment over treatment. For children, we know that family focused, individualized treatment, delivered in a child's community can improve that child's mental health and prevent them from offending in the first place. It is proven that if you integrate these mental health and substance abuse services with schools and child agencies and you make it happen at the local level, it provides even greater success. In fact, linked with community services, these other treatment programs have been shown to reduce contact with the juvenile system by 46 percent. 
This amendment, really, builds on this. Under this amendment, States receiving Federal prison construction moneys would be able to use these funds to implement mental health screening and treatment of adult and juvenile offenders within their correctional systems. It is badly needed. Those States receiving Federal prison construction moneys would also be required to develop a plan for mental health treatment of mentally ill offenders. Finally, States receiving these funds would be required to provide the attorney general an initial baseline study of mental illness in their correction facilities. 
We can't any longer ignore this tragedy. What I saw in Tallulah is a national disgrace. The wholesale neglect of adults and youth with emotional disturbances in our prisons must end. We, as a society, have the moral obligation to see that they get the help they need. 
I thank both of my colleagues for supporting this 
amendment. I want to end on this note. I said it once earlier. I want to make it crystal clear, because I am sensitive to not doing any bashing of any one State. Yes, I visited the facility in Tallulah. I will tell you something, those conditions shouldn't exist. I will tell you something else, beyond the connection of mental health in children and children who have never committed a crime, they just get dumped in these correction facilities, and then when they are there they get no treatment, no vocational ed treatment, precious little education, no counseling, inadequate medical attention, on and on and on. 
Mr. President, the other thing I want to say, which is another point which I guess speaks back to the vote we just had, I tell you I am all for holding people accountable when they commit a brutal or heinous crime. I have said it before and I will say it again, when three 16-year-olds beat up an 85-year-old woman and leave her for dead, I don't feel sorry for them. But I tell you Democrats and I tell you Republicans, anybody who believes that those kinds of conditions that I saw at Tallulah Correctional Center--they exist in a lot of other centers, and people in Louisiana are taking action to make things better, and I believe they will--anybody who thinks that is the answer, is way off base. A lot of those kids, those 11-year-olds and 12-year-olds I met, I wouldn't have been afraid to meet then at 10 at night before they came to this `correction' facility, but I wouldn't want to meet some of these kids at 10 at night alone after they have been in these facilities. 
What do you think we will get from this with these kinds of conditions? What do you think we will get from this when you put kids in brutal conditions? You make them brutal. Every one of these children who I visited with is a mother's child and a father's child. This is disgraceful. This is disgraceful. 
I wouldn't say this is necessarily the central issue in the country. That is why I thank my colleagues for their support. But I am telling you I really believe this amendment will be very helpful, because what this amendment will do is it will say to the States, look, if you want to do the assessment before you incarcerate a kid, if you want to find out what happened by way of violence in the home or substance abuse, or whether or not the kid should even be in a correctional facility versus somewhere else, and you want to figure if they should be incarcerated--some should--or what kind of treatment is needed, you can use some of this money to do that. We have estimates of up to 25 percent-plus of the kids in these juvenile correction facilities are struggling with these mental problems and we just abandon them. 
The second thing it said is, look, States, with your prison system, you have to lay out the plan that you have for dealing with some of the people who are in the system who are struggling with these mental problems and what kind of treatment they will get. We are worse off as a nation in terms of losing our soul if we don't do this. Frankly, it is in the self-interest of every family in America to make sure we get treatment to these kids and treatment to some of these people who are incarcerated. If they don't get the treatment, or the conditions that I described today from Fox Butterfield in the New York Times article, we are all worse off for it. 
So I thank both my colleagues for their support. I hope I will get strong support in conference committee as well. I am very proud to have had a chance to introduce this amendment, and I am pleased that the amendment is going to be accepted. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Wyoming, way over there, if he needs more time, we don't have many people on the floor. I don't want him to rush on my account. Does he need more time? If so, I am pleased to wait.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are a number of matters I thought I would cover, since there are not a lot of people here on the floor today yet. First of all, I want to talk about the appropriations bill that we passed for VA and HUD last week. While I submitted a statement for the Record, since we were in a rush and squeezed for time, I didn't have a chance to talk about FEMA and in particular the Director, James Lee Witt. I feel bad about that. I want to talk about FEMA, and I want to talk about Mr. Witt today on the floor because this small agency with a very big heart has made a huge difference to a lot of our States--to a lot of people in our States. As we go to conference, I hope the conferees will remember the very big job I think FEMA does and will honor the level of funding requested by the President in the President's budget. 
My contact with James Lee Witt--I want to talk about him, and then I want to talk about FEMA. It is about more than one person. It goes back to 1993. The Chair today, from Kansas, of course, knows agriculture as well as anyone and knows what happens when you are faced with record flooding. We were hit with just terrible flooding in 1993. Farmers couldn't plant the crop. There was a lot of economic pain. I think that is the first time that I had a chance to just watch James Lee Witt in action. 
What I was most impressed about was just what we call the hands-on approach. I felt he was the opposite of somebody who was impersonal, the opposite of a `bureaucrat.' By the way, there are many bureaucrats who aren't `bureaucrats.' There are many people in Government who do their very best for people. I get tired of the bashing sometimes. But he was so personable and really came through for people. 
Then, of course, not that long ago--what was it, a year ago, a year-and-a-half ago--we had the floods in North Dakota. Everybody remembers Grand Forks, the flooding, the fire, the cold winter weather, and East Grand Forks in Minnesota, and other communities--Ada, Warren--it was just devastating. 
I just want to say, again, the bad news is that, with FEMA, you know FEMA people are going to come out because there is a real crisis. The bad news of a James Lee Witt, the Director, visiting your State, is you know he wouldn't be there and other FEMA people wouldn't be there except for some kind of disaster, except for some kind of a crisis. The good news is that always good things happen afterwards. 
Once upon a time, I remember, there was all sorts of frustration about FEMA. I don't want my colleagues to forget what Mr. Witt has done. I think he is one of the best appointments the President has ever made. He has done an excellent job of making this agency so much more responsive to people in our communities, people who are facing a real crisis. What he did, and what FEMA did, to help people who had been affected by the devastating flood of the Red River, was just remarkable. It was just remarkable. I want to comment on that on the floor. 
Again, this past year, we were hit with tornadoes, and again the town of Comfrey was essentially leveled to the ground, St. Peter was hit hard, Le Center--I could talk about a lot of communities. Again, James Lee Witt came. 
The people in Minnesota, the people in these communities who have been faced with these crises, have tremendous appreciation for this Director--tremendous appreciation. He has gone the extra mile every time to try to push the categories of assistance as far as he can, to try to get the help to people, to try to make sure there is not unnecessary delay, to try to make sure he cuts through as much of the bureaucracy as possible. And he has done that. I just want to say to colleagues, especially to the conferees, I hope we give this agency the funding they really deserve. 
The other thing I think is real important is, FEMA is now focused on this predisaster mitigation program, which I think is real important. This is another example of FEMA being in a good partnership with our local communities and with our businesses, to figure out, given what we have been faced with, how, in fact, we can do the mitigation work to prevent a lot of the damage and a lot of the pain and a lot of cost that happens afterwards. This is a very proactive Director. 
My last point is, I have fallen in love with FEMA people. I don't know if I would ever do this or not, but I am tempted, if I have the skill, when I am no longer in politics or public life, to work for FEMA. It is really fascinating when you get to know people. These are people from all around the country, and they travel around, they respond to these crises, they come into your State, they live in the State--it is like a family. 
It is constant responding to people--people who have been flooded out of their homes, people who don't have any clothing, people who don't know where they are going to stay, people whose businesses have been destroyed. 
Of course, it is so difficult, but I am so impressed with a lot of the FEMA people and the job that they do. It is just quite amazing. You meet a former head of the State patrol of California, retired military person here, retired business person there--a whole lot of pretty fascinating people who work for FEMA who are just experts at dealing with these crisis situations. 
I don't think that any of us had an opportunity to speak about FEMA as we were going through the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I wanted to speak about FEMA, and I wanted to speak about FEMA's very able Director. I am positive that I am not just speaking for myself. I am also positive that I am not just speaking for Democrats. I think there are many Republicans who would echo my sentiments about Mr. Witt and about FEMA.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last week I had a chance to speak about the auto workers' strike in Flint, MI. Today, this strike is about local issues, but it is of national importance. Today the presidents and the other active members of United Auto Workers locals from around the country are in Flint, MI. I wanted to one more time say that we now are more than 5 weeks into this strike. 
This has affected, I think, well over 100,000 workers in the country, not just the workers of Flint. The issues are clear cut--health and safety issues, which still are very important issues at the workplace in America, the speeding up of production lines, and the sending of work or the contracting out to outside suppliers. 
My own view is that GM has made a mistake with what I characterize as hardball tactics, because I think what happens is with hardball tactics--the walking away from negotiations, the threat of cutting off health care benefits of those who are out on strike, the threat of shutting down the two parts plants in Flint, MI--what it does is it undercuts the very good labor relations that actually are so critical to productivity. 
On the floor of the Senate, I say to GM in particular that I think good labor relations begin with a handshake, not a 2 by 4, and I hope to see both parties back in negotiations, and the sooner the better. 
What is happening in Flint, MI--again, the issues are local but the significance of it is national. What is at stake is American jobs, good jobs, living-wage jobs, jobs that pay a good wage with good fringe benefits. 
As I stand today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I want to make it clear that as a Senator, that even though I am on the floor of the Senate, I also feel like my heart and soul are with the auto workers in Flint, MI. I extend my support as a Senator from Minnesota. 
There is a whole tradition to this. When I was a college teacher, I used to teach labor history, a labor politics class, and some of the most famous sitdowns took place in Flint, MI, in 1937--a very courageous, very courageous action by workers. These auto workers come out of a very rich tradition, a lot of courage by their parents and their grandparents, and I believe they are showing the same courage today. 
My hope is that we will see that negotiations will resume, that there will be a fair settlement, and that the United Auto Workers will not only have done well for themselves, but, more importantly, will do well for workers around the country. 
There are key issues here--health and safety issues. People who work have a right to say, `Look, we're going to work, but we're going to work under civilized working conditions.' People have a right to have a decent wage. People have a right to focus on pension and health care benefits. People have a right to be concerned about the contracting out of jobs. They have a right to be concerned about the trade agreements, as a matter of fact. 
That is why the workers in Flint, MI, are on the picket line today, and that is why, as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, I strongly support these workers who are out on the picket line.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I read today in the paper--and I am not quite sure where we are headed, and I always look forward to having a chance to meet and talk with the majority leader, agree or disagree, on all issues--but I read in the paper the majority leader said he didn't think he would have time to bring up the nomination of James Hormel. That is a terrible mistake. 
I have spoken on the floor. I said after the tobacco legislation, I was looking for an opportunity to offer an amendment. Frankly, on the basis of discussions I had with a lot of different people, I decided that it would be better to wait because I was hoping, if you will, that cooler heads would prevail on this matter and we would figure out a way to bring this nomination to the floor. 
If it is a debate or discussion, it will be a good debate 
and good discussion. Too much of the climate has become too poisonous. If the majority leader is basically shutting the door on any action on the floor of the Senate--I hope he isn't; I guess that is my plea to the majority leader: I hope you have not done that--I want to find out as soon as possible. Then, I believe, it will be important for some of us to bring amendments to the floor and, basically, one way or another, have a debate and have an up-or-down vote. 
Every Senator is entitled to their own opinion about whether or not James Hormel would be an able Ambassador to Luxembourg, and every Senator is entitled to a vote. I am entitled to my opinion, and I am entitled to a vote. I think the majority of us --well over 60 of us--would vote to confirm this nomination. 
I cannot see anything in Mr. Hormel's record--anything in his record, anything in his record--that would disqualify him from this job. I see someone with an enormously successful background in education--that means a lot to me; education has been my life's work--a very successful business person, philanthropist, and very active in the legal profession. For the life of me, there is no reason to stop this nomination, except for the fact--and if this is the fact, let's get it out in the open--that he is gay. If that is what troubles colleagues, come out here and say it. If colleagues want to say he is gay, or if they want to say he has been too outspoken on gay causes, then let's get that out here. 
Too many comments have been made in the last several months --made here, there--and I don't think that is good for the Senate. Frankly, the failure of the U.S. Senate to at least bring this nomination to the floor and have an honest discussion and an honest debate--frankly, this is less about Jim Hormel than it is about the Senate. The Senate is far more on trial than is Jim Hormel. This is not good for this institution. If this is just a case of discrimination against somebody because of their sexual orientation, we all have to look ourselves in the mirror. If not, fine, we will have the discussion, we will have the debate, and we will have the vote. But I don't think, as much as I might respect the majority leader or respect his prerogatives, necessarily his word would be the final word, at least in terms of a discussion and a debate. My hope is, we can figure out a way of bringing Mr. Hormel's nomination to the floor and that there will be a vote.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Finally, Mr. President, seeing no other colleague on the floor, I want to talk about this more in detail and in depth when we have the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill before us, which I think will be in the next day or so. I am working on an amendment--I hope it can be ready--that actually evolves from a piece of legislation I have been working on for some time dealing with mental health in children. 
I have been very lucky to have done a lot of the mental health work with Senator Domenici from New Mexico, my Republican colleague. He has certainly been more of the leader than I have, but I have been honored to work with him. 
Mr. President, I went on a visit--I will talk about this in more detail, in more depth later--to Lula, LA, about 2 weeks ago as a Senator. I think it was some of the best work I have done as a Senator outside of Minnesota--the best work is in Minnesota. I wanted to go there because I have read some Justice Department reports about the need for real dramatic improvement in the conditions affecting these children. 
I see pages here. This is a corrections center, and the kids that are here in the center range in age from 11 to about 18. A lot of the kids I talked to were 14, 15. I did talk to several 11-year-olds as well. I went down there determined--I talked to both of my colleagues from Louisiana, not to sort of say, well, how terrible, Louisiana; only in Louisiana. I do not believe that for a moment. I think we can do a lot better. 
My focus had to do with mental health and children. The estimates now made by the Justice Department--there was a pretty powerful front-page story in the New York Times that was written last week that I will get in the Record when I offer this amendment. But the fact of the matter is, the estimates are that about 25 percent of the kids here struggle with mental problems. Many of them actually never committed a crime. I mean, they would be picked up, they would run away from home, be out in the street. A very small percentage committed a violent crime; I guess probably less than 10 percent, closer to 5 percent. I will talk about that in a moment. 
But what happens is that these facilities--and this is certainly what happened in Lula--become a dumping ground with kids struggling with mental illness. They should not be there in the first place. To compound the problem, they are there, but with no treatment. And to compound that problem, it becomes pretty brutal with them. They should not be there. 
I went to Lula--and, again, I am going to be very careful as not to speak with that much emotion because there is plenty to be emotional about, but to just give a report on the floor of the Senate. I will focus on this again in more detail with the amendment so my colleagues know what the amendment is about. 
In the administrative building there were a lot of people from Louisiana that were there, a lot of officials, which was fine. I met the new warden, whom I believe is trying to make changes. He just got there, so it would be unfair to pin any of this on him. 
I wanted to go to the solitary confinement cells because I also heard kids were locked up in solitary confinement as many as 23 hours a day for as long as 6 or 7 weeks. I wanted to know which kids. I wanted to know, What does a kid do to be put in solitary confinement like this? What is the criteria you use? I wanted to know more about that. 
Initially, we negotiated, and the idea was I would get there, but first I would start off with kids who were eating lunch. I went in, and it was interesting. There were kids eating lunch. I also say, since I think race is still a reality in America, my guess is over 80 percent of the kids of about 500-plus kids were African American. I do not know what the population is in Louisiana--certainly nowhere close to 80 percent. 
Kids were eating, and I went up to some kids who were eating, and I just said, `How are you doing?' This one young guy said to me, `Not that good.' I said, `What do you mean?' He said, `Well, you see this food?' By this time lots of officials were with me. He said, `See this food?' I said, `Yeah.' He said, `We never eat this food. We never have a meal like this. This is just because you're here.' 
He said, `The table--smell the paint. This was just painted. These tables don't look like this.' He said, `These clothes I have on,'--I am just reporting what he said to me--he said, `These clothes I have on, they just gave us this stuff last night. These aren't the clothes we usually wear. It's hot. There's no air conditioning. You know, we smell--the same clothing, same underwear. We never get new clothing like this.' 
Then he went on and he said, `When you go outside and you look at the baskets there, when you look at the hoops, the nets were put on the hoop. We didn't have any nets on these hoops. This all just happened. This is a show.' 
That is the way it started out. I just give that report. Then I walked across the yard, heading over to where the solitary confinement cells are, and there was a group of kids outside. It was very hot. And this one young man just basically broke away from the guards and leaped on to a roof of a building and started running toward me. I had a whole lot of people that were with me, a lot of media people from Louisiana, and again a lot of people from the State. 
I went over to where he was, and I said, `You're going to get in a lot of trouble.' And I think he said, `I know.' I said, `Why are you doing this?' He said, `I want to make a statement.' I said, `What is your statement?' He said, `I want to tell you this is a show. And I want to tell you, when you leave we're going to be beaten up; we're going to be retaliated against.' 
Mr. President, I then met with four kids and their lawyer 
from the Southern Poverty Law Center--a great lawyer--for about an hour. They talked about some of the retaliation--which, by the way, I have to give the warden credit. There has been some reduction in this. But the more I was there, the more it became clear to me--and, again, I will, from Fox Butterfield's article in the New York Times, I will spend more time on this with the amendment. 
But it became clear to me that there was precious little by way of vocational ed, hardly any education, not adequate counseling services, not an adequate way of assessing kids. Did they come from a home where there was violence in the home? Were there substance abuse problems? Were they themselves in need of treatment, especially in the mental health area, pharmacological treatment, or other treatment? Hardly adequate medical facilities. 
I just have to tell you, Mr. President, I am not so angry at Louisiana because I know you can find plenty of these conditions around the country. But I am wondering how in the world we can let this happen in America. 
Some of the kids I met with--one boy had stolen a moped, and thus he wound up here. One was there for breaking and entering and had broken into somebody's home. Another cut somebody with a knife in a fight, so on and so forth. 
But here is my question: I have two questions now. One, which will speak to the amendment that I hope to have ready, and the other goes beyond that. On mental health and children, I really do believe--and I spoke with the warden afterwards and, again, I give him credit for, I believe, trying to make changes, and I believe the same with the commissioner of corrections. I am always interested in having things change. 
Senator Breaux said that there is going to be an all-out effort to do a lot more by way of training with the staff there. But my question is whether or not--when it comes to Louisiana or any State in the country, from Louisiana to California, to New York, to Minnesota; though I think there are great differences, great differences right now--the question really is this: Whether or not we are going to, within some kind of framework of integrated mental health services, provide these States with some resources so that, in fact, an assessment can be made, and so that we just do not dump kids in these facilities. And if they are in these facilities because they really have committed a crime, and they need to be in such a facility--although there are many alternatives--then we ought to make sure they get the treatment. 
The second thing that I want to say, Mr. President, in this particular case is this has been all contracted out to--I forget the name of the company--and I have to wonder about how we do this. I mean, I have to say, I am all for profit. I am all for a strong private sector, especially the more small business focused it is, the more I like it. But when you are talking about juveniles, they are supposed to be receiving additional help. 
They are supposed to get the educational and vocational opportunities. And they are supposed to be able to receive the kind of support services that will enable them, when they are 15 or 16 and after they have been in these facilities, to get out and rebuild their lives. 
I have to tell you, America, that I do not think too many of these kids are going to be able to do that. And, frankly, if they went in mixed up, having made a mistake, having done something they should not have done, they are going to come out very different. You might not want to meet them at 10 p.m. at night. 
I think what we are doing in some of these facilities is so shortsighted, it is so myopic, it is such a big mistake. Yes, hold people accountable. And if people commit crimes and should be in a corrections center, so be it. But you know what? There are certain standards of decency. There are certain standards about how we treat young people. Every one of these children is some mother's child, is some father's child. I do not care whether they are in Lula, LA, or in California, New York, Minnesota, or any other State. 
Now, one of the things in Minnesota that I will brag on a little bit, although it is not heaven on Earth, we have tried very hard to do an assessment at the front end of the system and look for alternatives to incarcerating kids. I just think it is an area that even if we don't want to look at--sometimes we don't want to know what we don't want to know--we better look at this with our eyes open. These are kids. These are kids. A lot of them shouldn't be there. A lot of them are struggling with mental problems. A lot of them aren't getting any care whatever. We are talking about the criminalization of mental illness. 
Above and beyond that, the other issue I point out is that the overall conditions of this facility are unconscionable. I want to make it clear again to the warden and to Louisiana, it is not just Louisiana. I know that. That just happened to be my first visit. But I do have to tell you that after 3 hours--and I don't think I am naive; I have done a lot of organizing in a lot of communities with a lot of people who have struggled on the bottom--I have to tell you I was reeling for 3 hours there. I believe we have to do better. I am looking forward to introducing this legislation and maybe it will be an amendment on this bill. I hope I will get good support from my colleagues. 
I thank both of my colleagues from Louisiana, in particular, for being supportive, talking with me about the trip, and their very strong interest in working with officials in Louisiana to make things better. There are some people in Louisiana State government who are absolutely committed to doing that. I know that. I certainly hope, as a Senator with an interest in this area, I can help out with their efforts. 
What I can't, however, forget, as I speak on the floor of the Senate, is what I saw. I saw conditions that I didn't think existed today in America. I saw kids living under conditions that should not be. Kids shouldn't be assaulted or beaten up for no good reason. That will take us nowhere. 
There are new people who are moving in as security guards. There are changes that are being made. But I tell you, the sooner the better; the sooner the better. That is one of the reasons I speak on the floor of the Senate to try to help make these changes happen. 
I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of Senator Murray, Senator McCain and myself. This amendment speaks to an injustice. This amendment would restore benefits to veterans for smoking-related diseases. We had a lot of smoke and mirrors, we did a lot of things in the budget resolution that we should not have done. We have never had an up-or-down vote. 
What this amendment essentially says is we should not have used that offset for highways, taking benefits that go to veterans. It is that clear. 
Mr. President, let me just be crystal clear. There have been a lot of OMB stories that I would question. I believe there will not be that much that will be required, but this funding ought to go to veterans. In fact, I would argue you will never get the $17 billion for highways, and we will ultimately have to go to surplus anyway. I have heard my colleagues talk about the surplus that we are going to have. We can at least take a little bit of that surplus and give it back to veterans. We never should have taken their benefits away. It was an injustice. This amendment by Senator Murray, Senator McCain, and myself would restore those benefits.

I used the same gimmick that was used with direct scoring. There is no sequestration at all in this amendment. None of what my colleague from New Mexico has just said is going to happen.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the good work of my colleagues, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, for taking on the difficult task each year of drafting the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I don't think many of us envy the job they have or the difficult choices they have had to make. 
I have come to the floor today to talk about a small but very important agency that is funded in under the VA-HUD Appropriations bill--the Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA. 
My first experience with FEMA was during the devastating floods that swept through Minnesota in the Spring of 1993. Most recently, I traveled with James Lee Witt to tour the damage caused by tornadoes this spring from Comfrey to St. Peter, Minnesota. I never thought that I would be forced to learn the intricate ins and outs of FEMA's programs and other emergency assistance programs, but I have. Since the flood of 1993, FEMA has been there on several occasions to help Minnesotans as they struggled through the early days after tornadoes and blizzards and floods to rebuild their lives and communities. 
I want to thank James Lee Witt the Director of FEMA for all of his help over the years. 
I really had the opportunity to get to know James Lee during last year's devastating flood of the Red River. He is one of the President's most outstanding appointments, a dedicated public servant and a great guy. Spending time with James Lee always has a catch, because it usually means that something really bad has happened in your state. 
The good news is that it also means that something good is about to happen. Because FEMA comes in fast, comes in ready and works in partnership with state and local communities and authorities. FEMA is a great partner to have. 
Under the direction of James Lee Witt, FEMA has undertaken a new program called Project Impact, a predisaster mitigation program. With Project Impact, FEMA joins in partnership with local communities and private sector businesses to educate residents on the steps they can take to reduce the damage disasters bring to our families and communities. This is another example of FEMA being a good partner. 
FEMA and Director James Lee Witt have been there on many instances to help my state. I want to thank them for their assistance. Following our action here on the floor of the Senate, this bill will move to conference. At that time I hope that our conferees will remember the needs of a small agency with a big job--FEMA--and support the level of funding that was requested in the President's budget.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for more than 5 weeks, the Nation's largest industrial corporation has been locked in a labor dispute with workers in two of its Flint, MI, plants. I do not believe that we have had any discussion on the floor of the Senate about this. I want to speak about it. The company and the workers are fighting over local issues--health and safety, speeding up the production lines, and sending work to outside suppliers--but these local disputes also highlight a broader national concern that affects millions of working Americans: how U.S. corporations invest, how they compete, and where they invest. 
GM's hard-line stance and labor-war tactics endanger the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers in the automotive industry and in the industries that rely on auto production for their business. Ironically, these hardball tactics also undermine the very competitiveness that GM says it wants. 
Competitive firms need good labor relations; and good labor relations begin with a handshake, not a 2 by 4. 
Monday's Washington Post reported that high-level negotiations to end the strike broke down Sunday `amid signs the auto maker now may be willing to risk an all-out labor war.' The company has asked an arbitrator to rule on the legality of the strike. The union has said fine. But GM's vice president in charge of labor relations broke off negotiations, refusing to even participate further in talks to reach an overall solution to the strike. The Post further reported, `A GM source said some top company officials are pushing for a form of drastic action to `send a clear message to the UAW' * * * Options reportedly under consideration, the source said, range from a legal action challenging the walkout * * *; cutting off health-care benefits to all UAW members idled by the strike; or shutting down the two strike-bound parts plants in Flint, Mich., and contracting out the work. Such a move,' the Post explained, `would amount to an all-out war.' 
GM has taken the first step, filing a lawsuit against the union. GM would apparently rather sue than negotiate. They would rather fight than talk. The Post has reported that, `Company sources said the lawsuit is probably the first step in an escalating war between the company and the union.' 
This is no way for the Nation's largest industrial organization to treat its workers and their representatives. The duly recognized representatives of GM workers, the United Auto Workers, had sought to negotiate a global settlement. GM senior representative should come back to the table. 
Yes, GM has every right to seek to improve productivity and profits. But as yesterday's New York Times reported, `G.M.'s biggest productivity problem lies in its auto parts factories, which were * * * starved of investment during the 1980's * * * and have antiquated machinery as a result.' 
GM entered into agreements with the United Auto Workers to invest more in its American operations but has fallen short of making new demands on workers before it would comply with what it had already promised. 
What is really at stake here are American jobs--good jobs, with good benefits. The workers at GM's Flint parts plants are fighting to preserve those American jobs. Over the next 2 years, in this act alone GM threatens to transfer about 11,000 of these jobs to subcontractors or out of the country altogether. GM's workers are justifiably concerned with what the New York Times calls `G.M.'s steady push to build factories overseas while slowing investment in its low-profit American operations.' 
GM should stop fighting its workers and get back to investing in the creation of those good jobs which bring good benefits right here in the United States. Strikes are hard on everyone--on the company, on the economy, and hardest of all on the men and women on the picket line. The best way for GM, or any corporation, to avoid picket lines is to address the underlying problems that lead to strikes, not to challenge the right of workers to strike. 
The free world looked upon strikes in the 1930s with hope, because, as Franklin Roosevelt said in 1939, `Only in free lands have free labor unions survived.' As long as there have been unions, we have known that the right to strike and liberty go hand in hand. 
That is why, in 1860, Abraham Lincoln told striking New Haven shoe factory workers, `Thank God we have a system of labor where there can be a strike.' 
I have confidence in the auto workers of Flint, MI. Although I stand here today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, in my heart I stand with the auto workers of Flint, MI. They know the history of work, the auto workers of Flint, MI. 
It was the auto workers of Flint, MI, who, on December 30, 1936, called another strike against the same company, General Motors. The goal of that strike was simple, too. All the strikers wanted was for GM to recognize the union. For over 6 weeks, the auto workers of Flint, MI, stopped production in the famous 
Sit-Down Strike of 1937. They slept on unfinished car seats and ate what food their families could slip through the factory windows. The auto workers of Flint, MI, faced tear gas, heat shutoffs, and company security guards. Led by their new 29-year-old president of Local 174, a man named Walter Reuther, and the great union leader, John L. Lewis, the auto workers of Flint, MI, prevailed. 
Because the auto workers of Flint, MI, were willing to strike, the auto industry was forever challenged. Because the auto workers of Flint, MI, were willing to strike, over the years the automotive industry became a source of good jobs with good benefits and the Nation prospered. GM was the most successful auto maker in the world when it paid the highest wages, not the lowest. Americans want to be the beneficiaries of a more competitive firm, not their victims. And that is exactly why the auto workers of Flint, MI, walk the picket lines today.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to briefly speak to this amendment, as well, and I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I don't know ultimately how we will dispense with this. I understand there has been some change in the language from the original amendment that was brought to the floor. 
By the way, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson. 
In addition, I would like to say to my colleague, Senator Grassley from Iowa, a colleague for whom I have a tremendous amount of respect, that there are some provisions in this amendment I just don't quite understand. The idea of most farmers right now being able to put money in IRAs just doesn't make a lot of sense. If I go to northwest Minnesota this weekend and I say, `We have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that talks about your being able to put all the extra money you are making into IRAs, tax free,' they are going to look at me like I have been living on the Moon. What good does it do for farmers who are going under to have a provision talking about IRAs--that you can take all the extra money you have and put it into savings? 
For the last several days we have been talking about a farm crisis. We have been talking about 20 percent of the farmers in Northwestern Minnesota in economic trouble. We have been talking about people not being able to cash-flow. Why are we talking about IRAs, tax-free savings, for people who not only can't save but can't cash-flow on the record low prices they are getting? 
Second, we can talk about trade and fast track and all the rest. Our farmers can compete with anybody, anywhere, anytime, if we have fair trade. But in all due respect--and my colleague from North Dakota talked about this the other day--if I was to take a look at the United States-Canadian Free Trade Agreement, which was the precursor to NAFTA, which then superseded that agreement, and asked the wheat farmers in northwest Minnesota, `How are you doing on the basis of that trade agreement?' they would say, `What are you all talking about? You cut an agreement that did great for intellectual property rights, that did well for all the big grain companies, but left us completely out in the cold. Why in the world would you want to extend or expand that trade agreement that never gave us a fair shake or level playing field in the first place?' 
Maybe the wording of this amendment has changed, and maybe everybody can agree, but I only saw the original version; I was down here on the floor listening to my colleague from Iowa. I have to say, maybe we hear what we want to hear. Maybe we talk to different kinds of farmers. Maybe there is something else that explains this. But I have been to a fair number of farm gatherings, now called `farm crisis meetings.' When you walk into a school in northwest Minnesota, there is a sign outside `Farm Crisis Meeting.' 
When people start talking about what is happening to them, there are two things that I hear: No. 1, we need some direct assistance; this is a disaster. In northwest Minnesota, that means scab disease, wet weather, and low prices. 
My colleague, Senator Conrad, I think, will have an amendment on the floor talking about indemnity payments. People are saying, `In the here and now, please get that payment to us.' It is like in Ada, Minnesota, I say to my colleague from North Dakota. We got hit with the flooding. It destroyed the high school. FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Assistance, came in with direct grant money that enabled the communities to rebuild their school. That is what we are talking about--some direct assistance to family farmers so that they can rebuild their lives, so they at least have a chance to go on and don't go under. 
The other thing that I hear farmers talking about over and over and over again is price. In all due respect, this Freedom to Farm legislation which my colleague, Senator Grassley from Iowa, talks about, and I have heard other colleagues talk about staying the course, is a disaster. 
When prices were up, yes, people were for it--some were--when there were the transition payments. But we cut out the safety net; we took away from farmers their ability to have any leverage and get a fair price in the marketplace. Farmers can't cash-flow on less than $2 a bushel of corn and $2.58 a bushel of wheat. It is that simple. I think I am pretty good at arithmetic. If on every bushel of corn and every bushel of wheat you continue to lose a lot of money because it costs you far more to produce it than the price you get, then just producing more bushels of corn and more bushels of wheat will put you further into debt. 
The way it works, colleagues, vis-a-vis trade, is we should go with the trade, go with the exports. But if you don't get the loan rate up, the family farmers have no leverage with the grain companies, and the grain companies make the money on the trade; it is not the family farmers. The loan rate is what is key to the price. We are talking about price. It is like when I was teaching in Northfield, MN, at Carleton College, I remember one evening bringing in a bunch of farmers from the community so they could teach the class. Many of the students, even though Rice County, where they lived, was very much an agricultural county, hadn't had a chance to learn that much about agriculture. I remember one farmer coming in and he came up to the blackboard and he wrote down `price,' and then underneath it `price,' and then underneath it `price.' 
I just want to say one more time, since we had this discussion on the floor here today, that if we don't do something about the loan rate and get it up to give the farmers a price, they can't cash-flow. The exports will be great for the grain companies, but the farmers aren't going to get the fair price. Do you think that farmers, when they are dealing with the big grain companies, are dealing with Adam Smith's invisible hand, some small businesses? They are dealing with a few large companies that dominate. They are facing an oligopoly. They need to have some leverage in the marketplace, so we need to get the loan rate up. 
So, with all due respect, I am in profound disagreement about staying the course on Freedom to Farm. It has become freedom to fail. It is great for the grain companies and terrible for family farmers. If you don't get the price up, all the speeches and rhetoric in the world will not help, and the surest, quickest, most efficient, fairest way to get the price is to at least take the cap off of the loan rate. 
We lost that amendment yesterday. We are going to come back to it because, in the fall, this situation could be even worse. In the short run, to lead up to my colleague from North Dakota speaking, who is about to lay down an amendment, I fully support this effort by my colleague from North Dakota, which at least will get some indemnity payments out there and give farmers some assistance so our families can stay on the land and they can have a chance at least to dream about a better tomorrow. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my amendment would restore benefits to veterans with smoking-related diseases. How would we do that? It is simple. The TEA 21 highway program canceled the disability benefits that veterans would have received under existing rules and procedures, and it used that money instead to pay for more highway projects. My amendment would simply return the favor. It would repeal that offset from the highway bill. 
Let me go through the procedural history of this to review how we got to where we are today. This offset first appeared in the President's 1999 budget request. The administration, I think, wildly overestimated the cost of benefits for smoking-related disabilities. But this money was then taken from veterans and it was used elsewhere. There is a tremendous amount of indignation in the veterans community over this, and there should be. Congress decided to play the same game. In the budget resolution they agreed to deny benefits to veterans and use the money elsewhere just like it had been done by the administration. But the budget priorities were a little different. The savings were used for highway projects. That didn't happen on the Senate side, but by the time it came back from the House, that is what happened. That was the major reason I voted against that bill. 
The appropriate place to repeal this offset and restore veterans' benefits would have been in the technical corrections to the TEA 21 highway bill. Senator Rockefeller and I intended to offer an amendment which would have done just that, but we never got a chance because that amendment was folded into another conference report so we could never get an up-or-down vote. We all know that conference reports, as I just said, cannot be amended. 
As I have said before on the floor, it is only right that we should have a clean vote on this issue. This is not only a question of veterans, it is a question of accountability. There is simply no excuse for hiding behind procedural gimmicks to avoid responsibility. Some have said we have already voted on this bill, or we have already voted on this question, but I don't think that is true. 
Let me explain. The two votes we had on the budget resolution did not deal directly with this question. Senators got a chance to pretend they were for veterans and against the offset, knowing that 5 minutes later we could cast a vote in the opposite direction. 
We had some camouflage about doing a study sometime in the future. But I think we all recognize it was only a study. And the vote on the IRS reform bill was not a clean up-or-down vote; it was only a procedural vote, a point of order. We need to have a clean vote up or down, no subterfuge, no trickery. It is not enough to take these benefits away from veterans. Congress will add insult to injury by not having a clean up-or-down vote on this question. 
I think veterans should take a clear position on this issue, and that should go on the Record. Now, some may object to this amendment because it is legislation on an appropriations bill, or they may think that this appropriations bill is the wrong place to remedy this particular problem. Let me remind my colleagues that this offset was a jurisdictional raid to begin with. Transportation conferees stole the money without ever going through the Veterans' Affairs Committee. This was originally the Veterans' Affairs Committee. If we now repeal this offset through the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we will have to pay for it by taking even more money away from veterans. The highway bill took that money away. It was not taken away by the Veterans' Committee. Nobody wants to do that. Nobody wants to take more funding away from veterans. 
There are a few misconceptions that I would like to clear up. First and foremost, compensation for veterans with smoking-related illnesses was not a new program. It was not an expansion of a program. It was a benefit to which disabled veterans were entitled to under existing law. Veterans who had become addicted to tobacco because of their service in the military had the right to apply for disability. The highway bill took that right away. 
It is a very tough test that the veterans have to meet. Only 300 have passed it. These were not special rules, either. Those veterans had to meet the same legal and evidentiary requirements as for any other service-connected disability. They had to prove that their addiction began in the military service. They had to prove that their addiction continued without interruption. They had to prove that their addiction resulted in an illness. They had to prove that their addiction resulted in a disability. 
There is another thing that ought to be pointed out tonight. We are not really talking about $17 billion here. Let's be clear about it. OMB first came up with that figure based on an estimate of 500,000 claims granted every year. But over the past 6 years, a grand total of only 8,000 veterans have applied, and only 300 of those claims have been granted. CBO came in with a lower, but still high, estimate of $10.5 billion. But the TEA 21 conferees needed more money, so they took advantage of the higher OMB number to pay for a huge increase in funding for highways. 
The administration's cost projections are based on many, many unknowns. More importantly, OMB is assuming VA will grant 100 percent of all claims but, to date--listen to this, colleagues--VA has granted only 5 percent of the claims. The test veterans have to meet is simply much harder than OMB seems to think. 
There are a number of other unknowns with the administration's methodology. On the percentage of veterans who currently smoke or are heavy smokers, VA experts made what we consider to be a questionable assumption that veterans who smoke more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime would have the same disease rates as smokers; the percentage of veterans who may file claims for tobacco-related illnesses that are already receiving compensation for those or other conditions; the rate at which the VA can adjudicate these claims. There are lots of assumptions I would question. 
Let me get right down to the very nitty-gritty of what this amendment is about. My first choice would be to keep the old rules for deciding disability claims--the ones we had before the TEA 21 highway bill. I don't see why Congress should go out of its way to deny disability benefits to veterans. Don't we have better places to look for spending offsets? Back in World War II, these veterans had free and discounted cigarettes included in their rations, and those packs didn't even have warning labels on them. Soldiers were encouraged to smoke to relieve the stress of military strain. And now some of them are suffering the consequences and they are not getting the compensation. That is what is so outrageous about what we have done, and that is what this amendment intends to correct. 
The second choice--even if Congress does decide to deny these benefits, I find it hard to understand why this money should be taken away from veterans' programs. I believe, at the very least, it should stay with veterans. It is quite one thing to argue, look, though they deserve this compensation, they have to meet strict criteria to get this compensation. We handed cigarettes out like candy and we know veterans became addicted. They should have been entitled to this benefit. It is quite one thing to take away the compensation benefit, which we have done; it is adding insult to injury to not at least have to put that money, scored by OMB and CBO, back into veterans' health care. 
That is why I come to the floor and I speak with so much indignation about this. That is why Senator Murray from Washington and Senator McCain from Arizona join me in this amendment. If this offset proposal had been considered in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, as it should have been, I doubt that it would have seen the light of day. But if it had passed the committee, those savings would have remained within the committee's jurisdiction. Those savings would have been plowed right back into veterans' programs. That would have been my second choice. 
So let me be clear again. The first choice: This compensation should have gone to the veterans. This is an injustice; it really is. Secondly, if we weren't going to do that, it should have stayed in the Veterans' Committee. I can tell you that committee would have at least made sure that this money would have been invested in veterans' health care. Only because it is late at night and because there are other colleagues who have amendments--trust me, I think I can talk, without notes, for 2 hours about the holes right now--gaping holes--in veterans' health care, in the financing and delivery of veterans' health care. 
After all, we are running out of excuses for underfunding veterans' programs. Remember, for many years, Congress used deficit reduction as an excuse. That was the justification for flat-lining the VA budget in the 1997 budget deal. By the way, the flat-line budget is not going to work. It doesn't take into account inflation. It doesn't take into account all of the veterans now living to be 85--an ever-aging veterans population. It won't work. But now the deficit is gone and we can no longer claim that there are no offsets available. The first time an offset comes down the pike, and it is a real whopper, Congress immediately whisks it away to pay for other programs--programs that obviously have a much higher priority. 
I can't imagine how Congress can make its budget priorities any clearer. I have to tell you that if our priority is to live up to our commitment to veterans, then I believe we should have 100 votes for this amendment. 
The VA-HUD appropriations bill does include a significant $222 million increase over the President's request in funding for veterans' health care. I thank my colleagues, the Senators from Missouri and Maryland, for their very fine leadership. 
Let me bring something to my colleagues' attention. As the Veterans Affairs' Committee wrote in its letter to Appropriations, an increase of over $500 million is necessary to maintain the current level of services. My argument is that not only did we not give the veterans the compensation they would have gotten if we hadn't raided--really, what was their funding for their addiction, for their illness--but to add insult to injury, if we didn't do that, we should have at least put it into veterans' health care because we are not properly funding health care for veterans in this country. 
Before the budget deal, we just simply did not take into account the inflation that is taking place. The budget is not enough. 
Finally, let me be clear about what this amendment will do and what it will not do. 
First of all, this amendment does not cancel or deny any transportation projects. Those projects are already in law. This amendment would not affect them in any way. 
Second, this amendment that I have introduced with Senator Murray and Senator McCain would not trigger a budget sequester. It includes the same protection against sequestration, the same budget gimmickry that was included in the TEA 21 bill. 
It may be argued that this amendment would be using the surplus to pay for veterans' benefits. I would argue that the highway bill was spending the surplus because it was using an unreasonably high estimate for this offset. That is going to happen whether or not we repeal that offset. 
But to the extent we do restore previous law on veterans' disability benefits and waive the Budget Act--I am asking colleagues to waive the Budget Act--the cost is not going to be anywhere near $17 billion. I want to be clear about that. 
In the summer of 1997, the VA said it wouldn't be able to process more than a couple billion dollars worth of claims over 5 years. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, let me just summarize. I have decided to really try to be brief. There is a lot that I feel strongly about, and there is a lot that I would like to talk about. But I think my colleagues from Missouri and Maryland were gracious enough to let me come to the floor with this amendment and get to work on it. 
I summarize this way. This amendment would restore benefits to veterans with smoking-related diseases. This amendment that I introduce on behalf of myself and Senator Murray and Senator McCain does what we should have done--to have provided this funding for compensation to go to veterans for smoking-related disease. We did not do that through a whole lot of gimmickry and a whole lot of zigs and zags. We took that funding away from veterans. 
My second choice would have been to have at least invested this funding into veterans' health care. 
We have got so many needs for those that are 85, and elderly veterans; so many needs for veterans that are walking around and struggling with PTSD; so many needs for more drop-in centers; so many needs to fill the gaps in our current VA health care system. And we didn't put the money into the veterans' health care. 
Then, finally, I want to make real clear what this will do and what it will not do. 
I don't want anybody to be able to say that we are now going to cancel any transportation projects. That is not what this amendment does. 
I don't want anybody to say it is going to trigger a budget sequester. It has the same protection that we had against sequestration. 
I don't want anybody to argue that we will waive a budget order, that we will have to go into a surplus. We have a huge surplus. We put the surplus into the highways. Now, I am just saying take it back, even though you don't take it from the highways, because you have already funded that. You should at least take that money that belongs to the veterans that should have gone to them directly for compensation. 
I don't think we can avoid an up-or-down vote on this any longer. We should have a clear up-or-down vote. We should all be accountable. I feel very strongly about this, and I hope that I will receive very strong support for this amendment. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, other colleagues may want to speak to that. I will take 2 minutes, I say to all of my colleagues. 
I would like to thank the Senator from Maryland for her very kind remarks. I have to say that I will not go now through the technical part of what happened. I am telling you that this was a real injustice. We sort of went on record saying we wouldn't do this, and we have done it. We shouldn't have. This amendment restores that funding to where it should go. 
I wish to say to my colleagues that we have a huge surplus. We really essentially took some of that money and put it in the highways. We shouldn't have. We got the highways. But we left the veterans out in the cold. They know that. All of these veterans organizations know that. I will say this tomorrow again. All these veterans know that. Senator Murray, Senator McCain, and many of my colleagues know it as well. 
I hope that there will be very strong support for this, Democrats and Republicans alike, because, again, the money should have gone to deal with the problem, to deal with veterans who really are struggling with illness based upon addiction to tobacco, and, if not, it should have gone into the veterans' health care. It should not have gone, as my colleague from Maryland said, to pay for additional highways, which is what happened. 
So let's correct a wrong. Please. Let's have a very strong vote on this tomorrow morning. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand that in conference the issue of FHA property disposition reform may be raised. Without going into the details of any possible changes to the program, I would like to receive some indication from the bill managers as to how the funds that would be saved by such reforms might be used. I hope such savings would be used for housing assistance. It seems to me that this would be a unique opportunity to further address the 5.3 million American households with worst case housing needs. I know that my colleagues on the VA/HUD appropriations subcommittee worked hard to put as much money into housing as possible given the constraints that they were working under. I know housing is a priority for them. So I would simply ask my colleague if he agrees with the logic of putting HUD program reform savings into housing assistance.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for including in the manager's amendment, my amendment to the VA/HUD appropriations bill. This amendment addresses the loss of Section 236 and Section 221 housing across the country. Prepayment of federally assisted mortgages is exacerbating an already static housing market and is wrenching for the tenants, who often barely receive adequate warning that their homes may soon become too expensive for them to afford. My amendment provides tenants and local officials with fair notice that a Section 236 or 221 building is leaving the federal subsidy program. This allows tenants the ability to try and find alternate housing, and non-profits and local governments the opportunity to preserve the housing by buying out the owner's interest. 
Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act provided for the creation of federally assisted, privately owned affordable housing. Under the Section 221 program, the federal government insured the mortgages on certain rental housing, under the Section 236 program, the federally government subsidized the interest payments that owners of rental housing made on the mortgages. Both of the programs offered the security of a federal subsidy for building owners in return for their maintaining these buildings as affordable housing--the regulatory agreement signed between HUD and the building owner restricted the rents which could be charged on the units within the building so long as the mortgage was insured or subsidized by HUD. To be eligible for the program, an owner signed a 40 year mortgage, however, the deeds of trust for such properties that the owner could prepay the mortgage or terminate the insurance contract after 20 years and potentially remove that building from the pool of affordable housing. 
By the late 1980's, Congress realized that the loss of Section 236 and Section 211 properties could be devastating to the supply of affordable housing. In many communities across the country, housing and real estate markets were tight enough that owners of such properties had a strong incentive to leave the programs and convert their units to market rate, or to find alternate uses for the property. In 1987, Congress enacted the Emergency Low Income Preservation Act, which created a two year moratorium on prepayment of Section 221 or Section 236 mortgages. This was done to allow Congress some time to formulate a comprehensive solution to the prepayment problem. In 1990 as part of the National Affordable Housing Act, Congress enacted the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of LIHPRHA (LIPRA). This law was intended to manage the prepayment process, to provide incentives for owners with critical properties to stay in the system and to create a mechanism for transfer of properties to nonprofit or resident ownership. 
Today this system is in tatters. Congress has not appropriated funds for the incentive program since fiscal year 1997 and it appears that HUD is no longer enforcing the provisions of LIHPRHA which call for fair notice to tenants and a plan of action to be submitted by owners. 
Mr. President, the loss of Section 236 and 221 properties has become a crisis in my state. The Minnesota Housing Finance Agency believes that 10% of Minnesota's Section 236 and 221 housing is at risk--Housing advocates believe that the long term losses will be far greater. But the loss of these apartment buildings does not occur in a vacuum, the Twin Cities metropolitan area has a vacancy rate of 1.9 percent--five percent vacancy is usually regarded as full. The loss of these buildings as affordable housing is absolutely devastating to these communities. 
Mr. President, I'd like to share some examples from my own state of illustrate the problem facing these tenants. These Minnesotans have had their lives completely disrupted by the prepayment of a Section 236 mortgage and if you listen to their stories over and over again you hear the same thing: with more notice they could have organized an equitable buy out of the current owner's mortgage or have made a dignified search for other housing. 
Terry Truja moved into Oak Grove Towers in Minneapolis, MN, ten years ago when she became disabled; she now uses a wheel chair. She lived in the neighborhood around Oak Grove Towers for seven years prior to her disability and worked as a nurse. Her building's Section 236 mortgage was prepaid in July of 1997. Prior to the prepayment, Terry paid $250 a month for her apartment. After prepayment, her apartment now rents for $615. She has been able to stay in her apartment for one year thanks to en Enhanced Section 8 Voucher, but she will not be eligible for ordinary Section 8 after that period. Terry and the other tenants of Oak Grove Towers received 60 days notice that the mortgage was being prepaid. They are trying to work with a local non-profit who wishes to buy the building and keep it as low income housing, but now they are fighting against time. Extra notice could have made all the difference. 
Elza Glikina is a Russian immigrant who lives with her husband in Oak Grove Towers. She speaks fluent English and serves as a contact with the outside world for the many elderly Russian immigrants who live in the building, many of whom do not speak English. She says that these people `lived through so much grief in their lives' back in their home countries and that they `thought they had found peace' here in Oak Grove Towers where they have formed closed bonds with others of the same nationality. For them, Elza said, the prepayment was terrifying. It reminded them of arbitrariness and soullessness of life in the Soviet Union. 60 days was not enough time for these immigrants to get their affairs in order, to apply for supplemental assistance. Though Elza is more capable then most, she says that she `feels sick at the thought of moving.' 
Jennifer Nguyen is a severely disabled Vietnamese immigrant who lives next to her brother and mother in Oak Grove Towers. She suffers from multiple medical problems, including tuberculosis and has only a portion of one lung remaining. Her doctor is located in the neighborhood, and her health might be seriously jeopardized if she is forced to move. She likes living at Oak Grove Towers, but if the building is not sold to a non-profit, she will likely have to relocate to the suburbs--away from her friends and her doctor. 
Ann Peterson is a mother with a nine year old son who lives in Boulevard Villa in Coon Rapids, MN. She works, but medical problems make employment difficult. The mortgage on their building was prepaid in April of this year. Tenants and local housing officials received three weeks notice of prepayment. Ann and others tried to find a non-profit to take over the mortgage but three weeks was just not enough time--in fact it took 6 weeks after prepayment for the paperwork to provide Enhanced Vouchers to be approved. She has lived there 8 years and says that she still `has faith that they will be able to stay.' She continues to try and find a buyer for the building. 
Mr. President, these are a few stories from two buildings where the Section 236 mortgages have been repaid. Together they represent the potential loss of 281 units of affordable housing--in a market that already has a 1.9 percent vacancy. Again, I think there stories show why notice is important for two reasons: as a buffer to the tenant and to allow local governments and non-profits time to react to keep the housing affordable. 
Mr. President, I believe my amendment is a step in the right direction. It: 
1. Requires an owner of eligable low income housing, such as a Section 236 or Section 221(d)(3) building, who intends to prepay a federally subsidized mortgage or terminate the federal insurance contract to give a one year notice of such intent to the tenants of the affected property and to the appropriate state and local authorities. 
2. Waives this requirement in the event that the owner wishes to transfer the property to a non-profit or Residents Council which intends to maintain the units as affordable housing. 
3. This amendment does not apply to owners who have already given notice of prepayment or termination, as of July 7, 1998, in accordance with current law and regulation. 
Under current federal law, tenants of federally assisted rental housing receive only 30 or 60 days notice of an owner's attempt to pre-pay an insured mortgage. This short time period makes it impossible for the tenants, their advocates, local or state government to devise any alternatives to prevent the permanent loss of affordable housing. Minnesota has enacted a one year prepayment notice requirement, but this been pre-empted by LIHPRHA, LIHPRHA specifically struck down state laws which put more restrictive requirements for Section 236 and 221 than is provided for in federal law. This was justified by the funding mechanism also included in LIHPRHA, which was designed to preserve the housing should the owner decide to prepay. Now that this federal funding is gone, I believe Congress should act to require a firm, one year notice period. Again, however, my amendment is not intended to cover owners who have given legal notice of prepayment or termination under the prepayment process currently being implemented by HUD. 
Mr. President, the Congressional budget office has determined that my amendment would not add to the cost of this bill. I don't believe it will be a burden to owners either. It simply provides warning to tenants, warning that I believe out of simple dignity they should be provided, and gives local and state governments the tools they need to preserve the housing--after buying out the owner at a fair price--in the affordable housing pool. 
Mr. President, other speakers have talked about the crisis in affordable housing. We are at a point in our history where we are simultaneously experiencing some of the most tremendous economic growth while enduring an all time high of renters with worst case housing needs--5.3 million people across the country. My amendment is a small change, but if it is a change which provides low income tenants with increased security and allows for ample warning so that housing can be preserved then, I believe it will have a big impact.

Mr. WELLSTONE. This amendment will lift the cap on the farmer's marketing loan rate and extend the loan repayment period from 9 months to 15 months. That sounds very impersonal, to lift the cap on the loan rate and extend the repayment period, but I say to my colleagues--and I know my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, will speak about this as well--this proposal goes to the heart of what we must do this week if we are to respond to the economic pain, and for that matter, the personal pain, of many farm families in our country. 
I will be going to another farm crisis meeting in Granite Falls, MN, in western Minnesota, this Saturday. I am hoping and praying I can come back with a report that we have been able to take some action that will give farmers some hope--it is really a desperate situation. 
Wally Sparby, who is the director of the Farm Service Agency in Minnesota, is predicting that on the current course--and we have to change the course--we could see about 20 percent of the farmers in serious trouble. That is a lot of farmers in the State of Minnesota. Agriculture is very important to my State. From 1996 to 1997, we saw about a 38-percent drop in farm income. 
When I talk to farmers at gatherings, or when I am in cafes in Minnesota, I think the one thing they talk about more than anything else--and I imagine you hear the same thing in Arkansas--is price. That is really the key thing--a fair price in the marketplace. That is what farmers are asking for. They are saying, give us a fair shake. 
Now, unfortunately, that is not what is happening, and I believe that one of the mistakes that was made in the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, which I called then the `Freedom to Fail Act'--and I wish I could be proven wrong, but unfortunately I think the evidence which is staring us in the face proves me right--while we gave farmers the flexibility in planting, which I am all for, the problem is that the loan rate which sets the floor price is set at such a low level. Right now, the 1996 farm bill caps the price at an extremely low level artificially. The rate is $1.89 per bushel of corn and $2.58 for wheat. No one can cash-flow or stay in business at these prices. 
Since market prices are now, in fact, nearly down to those levels for corn and for wheat, that is exactly why we have this crisis which we are calling an emergency. So far in Minnesota this year the average price for corn has been under $2 a bushel and it has been about $3.25 for wheat. In the wheat-producing parts of Minnesota, those low prices have combined with the bad weather and scab disease to create truly dire economic conditions. 
What I want to say to colleagues, and what I want to say to people in our country is that right now $2 a bushel for corn and $3.25 for a bushel of wheat is way below the cost of production. Farmers cannot make it--nobody can make it--at these prices, unless you are a huge conglomerate that can weather low prices while family-sized farms get driven out, and then you can buy up that land. But for the Midwest and for other parts of the country as well--this is not just a regional issue--for all of us who value the family farm structure of agriculture where the people who farm the land live there and live in the community, this is a crisis all to be spelled out in capital letters. 
What our farm policy used to be was that when the prices were good, you let the market pay the farmers. When the market wasn't so good, you would help stabilize income by holding the market price up. Freedom to Farm changed that. In other words, the loan rates gave the farmers some leverage vis-a-vis the huge grain companies because, if the prices were down, farmers just held on because they knew at least they would get this loan at this price. But, of course, the grain companies needed the grain so they would have to pay more. That set the price for the farmers. 
Now, what we have done with this cap is we have set the loan rate at such a low level, the prices are plummeting, people cannot make it at these prices and therefore they are going under. This is a matter of elementary justice. 
This amendment that I speak in behalf of lifts the cap on the loan rate. That means that the loan rate would rise to $2.25 for corn and $3.22 for wheat. This is still too low a price. 
I see my colleague from North Dakota in the Chamber. If we at least do that, combined with extending the period that the farmers can hold on for another 6 months, extend the loan rate period, then I think we can begin to lift the market prices. 
Now, I would like to raise the loan rate further, and Senator Dorgan and I may be back in the Chamber to talk about this later or to take action on this later. I think it should be something like at least $3 for corn and $4 for wheat, at least for a targeted level of production, which would be a family farm level of production. 
But I want to make it crystal clear that at the very minimum what we have to do this week--this is very reasonable; this is a 1-year emergency--is take the cap off the loan rate to begin to get the prices going up, extending the period for the loan rate, making sure that there is some indemnity payment, some disaster relief for farmers that have been hit by this disaster of low prices, bad weather, scab disease. This is all targeted, all focused on a disaster in rural America, in agricultural America, and this for us, for those of us who come from the farm States, is a matter of huge importance. 
There is no more important amendment that we could be speaking for than this amendment. 
Mr. President, I just want to speak to one argument that has been made on the floor, and that is the argument that trade is the answer. I am for trade. In fact, I wish we had fairer trade for agriculture. But I find it surprising that some so-called advocates for farmers are in a big hurry to grant fast track negotiating authority. 
My question is, For what? If we export more bushels of corn, or more bushels of wheat, at a loss, how does that do the farmer any good? I say to my colleague from North Dakota, it is sort of confusing to me. If, in fact, the prices are so low that the farmers in our States are losing on every bushel of corn or every bushel of wheat they produce, how does it help them to produce more bushels of corn or more bushels of wheat? It makes no sense at all.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in reply to my colleague from North Dakota, I also want to ask my colleague to focus his attention for a moment on the original United States-Canadian trade agreement superseded by NAFTA and ask him how well our wheat growers have fared by that agreement. 
Those who are talking fast track without a fair trade agreement for farmers--I want to raise a question about that in a moment. But let me say to my colleague, the thing I find maddening right now--and I hope I am wrong--is that, yes, obviously, if the farmers don't have the leverage and they can't get the price, it is great for the grain companies; they get to buy from the farmers at record low prices. The problem is that I think a lot of colleagues are not willing to revisit this question. In other words, we voted for what was called Freedom to Farm. We set 
the loan rate at such a low level, the prices have plummeted, and what I worry about is that somehow this amendment becomes a referendum on Freedom to Farm. It is not. 
For those colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, who supported the Freedom to Farm bill--fine; we can continue to agree or disagree. But for right now, given the fact that prices are way down, all we are saying in this amendment is, for 1 year, as an emergency measure, take the cap off so we can get the loan rate up, so we can get prices up. Combine that with indemnity payments and a couple of other measures, but in particular these two measures, and we can help get farm income up and enable people to stay on the land and not be driven off their land. That is what it is all about. In other words, time is not neutral. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. 
I would say to colleagues, I am willing to debate trade policy. Personally, I don't think the United States-Canadian agreement has worked well at all for our wheat farmers. Nor has NAFTA--it has been a terrible agreement, a terrible agreement. You can ask the farmers about that. 
But above and beyond any debate about trade policy today, above and beyond the overall debate about the Freedom to Farm bill, let me just simply make this appeal to everybody who is out here. For right now, can't we at least reach some common agreement on some emergency measures that we can take? The fact of the matter is, you can export more bushels of corn and more bushels of wheat, but if the price is so low it is costing the farmers more to produce that bushel of corn than the farmer is getting for that bushel of corn or bushel of wheat, they go further and further in debt. 
At least let's get the floor up. At least let's get the price up. At least let's get the disaster payments out there. If we do that, then we will have taken some action that will be concrete, will be real, and can make a difference. There is a lot more I would like to say about what I call the `freedom to fail' bill. I am a critic of it. I think it is a terrible piece of legislation. I said it then; I will say it now. It was great for the grain companies; it was terrible for the family farmers. It looked great when prices were up and transition payments were out there, but what goes up goes down, and now we have no way of stabilizing the situation for family farmers in this country. 
This amendment goes a significant way toward stabilizing the situation, getting the prices up, enabling our farmers to get back on their feet to be able to cash-flow. Combine it with the disaster relief payments and we will have done something good. 
I hope we will have support for this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Harkin spoke when I was out on the floor earlier, and Senator Dorgan, and Senator Johnson. Senator Conrad may have spoken. 
Mr. President, let me talk not so much about what is happening around the country, although most Senators represent States that are being hurt by this crisis in agriculture. Let me instead talk about what has happened in northwest Minnesota and what is happening right now in my State. 
In northwest Minnesota, we have been hit by bad weather. Everybody remembers the floods. We have also been affected by scab disease. And now we are facing very low prices with grain crops. 
Mr. President, the situation is dire. Wally Sparby, director of our farm service agency in the State, has predicted that we could lose as many as 20 percent of our farmers, that right now one out of every five farm families is in trouble and is struggling. Thanks to the help of Senators, including the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, we were able to get some help to farmers for spring planting season. We were able to get USDA farm credit to farmers at planting time. The problem is whether people are going to continue to be able to farm. 
Mr. President, I read from the testimony of Rod Nelson, who is president of the First American Bank in Crookston, which also has offices in the communities of Warren, Fisher, and Shelly in northwest Minnesota. Here is the concluding paragraph: 
In our bank in the fall of 1995, we began addressing the reality that things had reached a new level of concern, as many rather than some of our farm customers, were not doing well. Things have only gotten worse since then. This year we conservatively project to have 20 growers quitting or significantly downsizing their operation. We likely have an equal number thinking about doing so or in the process of doing so. It's important to note that to properly phase out of farming it takes good planning and 2, 3 or 4 years. The increased number we are seeing this year will likely be even larger next year. These numbers just represent our banks customers. As you look at the whole of Northwestern Minnesota, the picture would be worse because not all areas have beets which has been the one consistently good crop. 
Mr. President, I will just translate all of these statistics in personal terms. 
I hope we will take action in this Chamber that will make a difference. I hope it will happen in the House. I don't want it to be symbolic politics. I don't want a partisan debate. I hope it doesn't end up going in that direction, because I will tell you, I have met too many people who are now being driven off their farms. They not only work on the farms; this is where they live. During the mid-1980s, I was a teacher at Carleton College in Northfield, in Rice County, some 491 square miles, population I think about 41,000, and most all of my community organizing was in farm, rural areas. I spoke at so many different farm gatherings, and I knew so many families that were foreclosed on. I saw a lot of broken dreams and a lot of broken lives and a lot of broken families. That is exactly the direction we are going in right now. 
Farmers have good years and also some not so good years. Prices go up and prices go down. I am not, I say to my colleagues, going to come out here and rail about the Freedom to Farm bill. Maybe there will be a time to do that. I will say in a very quiet way that I really do believe this has been more for the benefit of corporate agribusiness, and I do think now that prices are falling and the so-called transition payments are dwindling, an awful lot of farmers are in trouble. That is the real point. 
We no longer have the safety net we once had. Farmers cannot make it on $2 corn, they can't make it on $3.25 wheat, and that is why at the beginning I said, and I say it again, I think the Freedom to Farm bill has become the `Freedom to Fail' bill. 
Now, after having said that, I want my colleague from Mississippi and other colleagues to know that I don't see this particular resolution or the amendments that we are going to bring to the floor over the next day or so as being a debate about the Freedom to Farm bill. I think it was a profound mistake. I voted against it. I will always take that position until proven wrong. 
By the way, I said when it was passed that I prayed I was wrong. I would be pleased to be proven wrong. If in fact the Freedom to Farm bill, along with the flexibility for farmers in planting, which I am all for, was to lead to family farmers doing better and the families being better off, I would be all for it. 
I guess that was the theory. But now we don't have the safety net we had, and, most important of all, farmers do not have the leverage in the marketplace to get a decent price. That is what I would put my focus on, a fair price for farmers, especially family farmers. 
Now, for people who might be watching our debate, I think this is special to me as a Midwesterner, because the family farm structure of agriculture is precious to our part of the country. We all know that the land will be farmed by somebody and somebody will own the animals. The question is whether or not the land is farmed by family farmers. The number of family farmers who live in our communities has a lot to do with who supports our schools, who supports our churches or synagogues, who supports the local businesses in town. This is a life-or-death issue for a very important part of America. This is a life-or-death issue for a part of America that is dear to many Americans. 
So first we have the resolution that is before us which asks the Senate to recognize that we have an emergency situation, and we do. This would potentially free up some funds that are needed to provide family farms and families in rural America with some support. 
Second, I think the most significant thing we can do is to focus on price. When I think about the discussions I have with farmers--I hope to be in Granite Falls, Minnesota this Saturday with State legislators. Doug Peterson is going to be there; Ted Winter is going to be there; Jim Tunheim from northwest Minnesota has been making the plea over and over: Please do something. Our focus will be to lift the current cap on the market loan rate. 
Right now, we have a cap on the loan rate which is $1.89 for a bushel of corn and $2.58 for a bushel of wheat, and this tends to set a floor under prices. But this is simply too low. It is just simply too low. Farmers cannot cash-flow with these kinds of 
prices. At a Minnesota average price for the year at $2 for corn, it simply is not going to work for family farmers. 
What I would like to do in the best of all worlds, is to remove these caps and raise the loan rate to the close to the cost of production--$3 corn and $4 wheat. That is what we should talk about. Instead, what we want to do is to at least take the cap off this loan rate, and then raise the loan rate to 85 percent of the average price for the last 5 years. That would be at about $2.25 a bushel for corn and about $3.22 for a bushel of wheat. 
Let me say to my colleagues, if we do that and we also extend the repayment period from 9 months to 15 months--all of it is paid back; this is not a giveaway--then what we will see is farmers getting a better price for their crop. 
We have to take the cap off the loan rate. We have to get the price up. There is no way that family farmers can make it otherwise. We can focus on exports. We can focus on all those other issues. That is fine. But the central issue is price, price, price. And right now that loan rate is set at such a low level and farmers have so little bargaining power in the marketplace that they cannot get a fair price. 
We also want to make sure that we have some price disclosure and reporting when it comes to what is going on with the livestock markets around the country. 
The problem is that there is plenty of competition among the producers, but there is no competition among the buyers of hogs and beef cattle. Therefore what we are talking about is a pilot project that basically puts us on the path toward mandatory price reporting by the packers. I personally would like to see mandatory price reporting done nationally, but I think this is a good step. We ought to know what they are paying. 
We have precious little free enterprise in what should be a free-enterprise system. The family farmers are the only competitive unit, and they find themselves squeezed both by the input suppliers and to whom they sell. 
Finally, crop insurance just cannot do the job if you face several disaster years in a row. Our amendment would replenish the disaster reserve of the Secretary of Agriculture so we can make payments to farmers who have suffered a disaster and for whom crop insurance hasn't worked. This is the indemnity feature of this piece of legislation. 
I say again to my colleagues, we can end up debating Freedom to Farm. I am all for debating it. But there is no way, whether it be what is happening to wheat farmers or what is now going on with corn growers as well, that farmers are going to make it if we don't get the price up. The most important single thing we can do as an emergency measure is to take the cap off the loan rate to get the price up, and, in addition, make sure that we can get some funding out there, some kind of indemnity program that will enable the Secretary of Agriculture, in the spirit of disaster relief, to get some funds out there to these families so that they have a chance. 
I want to say to my colleagues, I hope there will be overwhelming support for this resolution. More importantly, I hope that we will have overwhelming support for what is to follow. We want to take a position as a Senate that this is for real. The economy is at peak economic performance, but we are faced with a crisis in many of our rural and agricultural communities. Then what we have to do is pass amendments to this appropriations bill which take some concrete steps that can make all the difference in the world to the people we are trying to represent here. 
Those are steps I think we should take. I hope we get strong support for them. My priority is to be out on the floor speaking, debating this, working with colleagues, trying to get as much support as possible. For many family farmers in Minnesota and around the country, time is not neutral. It is not in their favor. 
If we are not willing to take some action that can make a difference, they are going to go under. We are going to see too many family farmers driven off the land. We will see more and more concentration of ownership of land. It is not going to be good for agricultural America; it is not going to be good for rural America; it is not going to be good for small businesses; it is not going to be good for small towns; it is not going to be good for the environment; and it is not going to be good for the consumers in this country. This is a crisis of national proportions, and I hope we will take corrective action this week on this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for the sake of other colleagues, I believe many will support our efforts on the floor this week because they know how important agriculture is. But when the Senator makes the point about what is going to happen to family farmers, as opposed to large conglomerates able to weather this crisis, I wonder if the Senator might want to explain to people who feel strongly about it why, from the point of view of consumers, it is important that the family farmers be able to stay on the land. Maybe some people will hear you talk and they might say, well, OK, so the giants can stay on, they will farm the lands, and what difference does it make to the vast majority of the people in the country? I wonder if the Senator can spell that out.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have one more question for my colleague from Iowa. We have colleagues here on the floor from North Dakota and South Dakota. You talk about the Freedom to Farm bill and the whole question of the price plummeting and the dramatic loss of farm income in a State like Minnesota where we are really hurting. Later on I will get a chance to speak to that. The Senator mentioned that income in North Dakota dropped by 98 percent. 
Could my colleague from Iowa explain, A, why the price has plummeted; and, B, when we talk about a fair price, what we are really saying here? Because I think people need to understand how centrally important the price is to this whole question. Would the colleagues from North Dakota and South Dakota also be willing to comment on this?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I am going to very shortly send an amendment to the desk. I want at the very beginning to just take a couple of minutes to thank my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, for their very fine work. To me, it is a labor of love to be on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and I want to very briefly talk about the Higher Education Act which was first passed in 1965. 
I want to highlight at the beginning the Pell Grant Program, and I want to pay my respects to one of the Senators whom I have most enjoyed getting to know and to work with. I think he is a giant. I think he represents civility. And that is Senator Claiborne Pell. When we talk about the Pell Grant Program, I would say to the pages, as you go to apply for higher education, the Pell Grant Program will be critically important. This was Claiborne Pell's great contribution. 
I do believe that eventually--and I think my colleagues agree with me; and I am really disappointed that we haven't done this--we ought to fully fund the Pell Grant Program. We have bumped it up now to about $3,100 or thereabouts, but, frankly, we ought to take it up to $5,000. It is the most cost-effective approach. You reach the most students in need. You reach well into the middle-income range as well. Students don't graduate in such debt. It is absolutely critically important, and that would remain for me kind of the major priority in higher education. 
I also want to just at the very beginning remind colleagues that I still think, on the Hope scholarship tax credit proposal, we have got our work cut out for us, because if it is not refundable, those students, many of whom are in community colleges, Mr. President, in our State of Minnesota, who come from families under $28,000 a year, just simply have no help at all. So the promise of a tremendous amount of assistance for 2 years of higher education is not being realized. 
The average college student today is just so different--I mean is really so different. I sometimes believe the nontraditional students, students who are older and going back to school, many of them with children themselves, have become the traditional students. Over 57 percent of college students are female--it certainly wasn't that way in 1965 when we passed the Higher Education Act--37 percent are students of color. The average age of a student today in higher ed is 27, and more than 25 percent of college students are over 30. About 1 in 5 are married, and 1 in 10 are single parents. So it is not just 18- and 19-year-olds living in the dorm any longer. Really, we are talking about a very different situation. 
I wanted to highlight this, and I will just take a few moments and then get right to the amendment by just some profiles of some of our Minnesota students. 
Tony Rust is a senior at Southwest State University at Marshall, MN, and the Minnesota State University Student Association State Chair. He received the Pell grant his freshman year, only the Perkins loan his first 3 years, and the Stafford loan all 4 years. During his 4 years of college, Rust has worked at least 20 hours per week in order to pay for tuition and other expenses. His parents have not helped him financially, but he did, however, receive scholarships during his sophomore year. `I wouldn't have been able to attend college without the Federal financial aid programs,' Rust said. `I wouldn't be graduating this weekend if it wasn't for federal programs.' Rust's loan debt will be approximately $20,000. 
That weekend, of course, goes back to the beginning of June. By the way, Southwest State University is one great university. And the thing I like about it best, Mr. President--you have probably visited it as well--is the accessibility for those students who are developmentally disabled. It is just an incredible place; it really is. 
Paula Heinonen, after working for years in a rural hospital and raising four children, decided to return to school to enhance her skills. A nontraditional student, Paula is a junior at the Center for Extended Learning at Bemidji State University at Bemidji, MN. Paula is a wife, mother, worker, and student. 
And we have a lot of students like that today on our campuses. 
Then, finally, Troyce Williams. Troyce is a single mother of four children who is working hard to complete her studies at Minneapolis Community and Technical College within the one-year education requirement--which I will come back to in the amendment. Affordable housing and child care are critical to her graduating. 
Mr. President, there are a couple of things in this bill I appreciate. There was an amendment I was proud of that we introduced, we did extend the Pell award for summer semesters, and that will help a lot these nontraditional students. I think that was terribly important. We did have increases, not all that we should have, in the Pell grants and in the TRIO Program. I don't think I heard a lot of discussion about the TRIO Program, but talk about a heart-and-soul program, I love the TRIO people in Minnesota. It is an effort to reach down in the public school system and attract students of color or `disadvantaged' students, low-income students, to higher education. And then, once there, once they are in our colleges and universities, to provide them with the kind of additional support services that they need. It is just wildly successful and, actually, we have strong bipartisan support for the TRIO Program. There was a time when we were fighting for the survival of the TRIO Program. I am really glad that both parties have united behind it. 
Senator DeWine and I--and I have enjoyed working with Senator DeWine from Ohio--we have an amendment in this bill that I feel very good about. What we essentially say is that for those men and women who graduate who go into early childhood development, there will be loan forgiveness. That is a really positive incentive. We keep saying we have to get it right for students before kindergarten, but we pay men and women in child care miserably low wages. You make half of what you make working at a zoo, if you are working with children. 
By the way, I think people who work at zoos do very important work. I love zoos. Actually, I think they are precious. But the point is, why in the world do we say, `These early years are so important for the development of the brain, as shown in all of the studies, and we have to get it right for these children, it has to be intellectually stimulating,' and we have so many people who work for $6 or $7 or $8 an hour, many without any health care benefits and all? Senator DeWine and I have a loan forgiveness provision in the bill which I think at least helps. 
We have a mental health package which will provide those who are choosing careers in mental health to have research work and internships on the campus to be considered as study. 
We have an effort with Senator Kennedy in an area that has languished, recruiting women into the fields of math and science. 
We do some things that I think are important with the Fair Play Act, which would require the university data--I say to the chair of the committee, don't worry, I am not going to get started on this today, at least--but we have expenditures on all sports to be shared with the Department of Education, so we can try to figure out why some of these minor sports, be they men's sports or women's sports, are being cut. 
My colleague, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, is great to work with. I am proud of the amendment we did on campus safety. We want more accurate reporting. We have an issue with the Senator from Pennsylvania, and we have a $10 million grant program for collaboration between campus police, local law enforcement, and those women who are working in battered women shelters, which I think is extremely important. 
Finally, we are going to have an GAO study just look again at some of the cuts in college sports, some of which I think have been arbitrary and capricious, and to try to have a little bit more accountability. 
I thank my colleagues for their work on this bill. I am proud of the amendments I was able to contribute. I think this is a very good piece of legislation. 
I now will send an amendment to the desk. This amendment I introduce on behalf of myself, Senator Wendell Ford, Senator Tim Johnson, Senator Dick Durbin, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. A number of these Senators are going to be out on the floor speaking on this amendment. I think it is an extremely important amendment, colleagues. I believe we can pass it. I hope we can pass it.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, most of my colleagues who support this amendment, and I believe there will be bipartisan support, supported the welfare bill. This is not about the welfare bill. Most colleagues who support this amendment were strongly in support of the welfare bill. 
I want to say at the beginning, a few words about that welfare bill which is a little counterintuitive to what I think people have been reading about or hearing about. I want to say, and unfortunately I believe I can marshal a lot of evidence for this point of view, that the reduction of welfare rolls by some 4 million plus people will be a good thing if what we are talking about is a reduction of poverty. The question is whether or not it has led to a reduction of poverty. There is precious little information out there and we need to understand, when we say to a family--a single parent, almost always women with small children--you now are off the rolls, you will be working, the question becomes what kind of jobs at what kind of wages can they support their families on? And, when they lose their health care a year later, are they worse off or better off? We have to make sure that these women and these children will be better off and that this will lead to a reduction of poverty, economic independence and all the rest. 
I am not at all sure that is happening. As a matter of fact, I think if we were ever to get the data State by State, we would find that many of these others and these children are worse off. First point. Then I will get to the amendment. 
Second point--child care. There are too many stories that too many people are now telling about how, yes, they are working, but it is a 3-to-11 job. Where is the child care available for their 3-year-old or their 4-year-old? There are too many of these families that talk about very ad hoc arrangements, one week it is a cousin, another week it is an older brother, but they never know from week to week how they will be able to find the child care. 
There are too many long waiting lists for affordable child care for working families. Now, you have another group of people who are coming into the workforce. There are too many first and second graders who are going home alone with no one there at all, and too many 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds also who are at home alone. That is the truth. Somebody has to look at that. I just want to say it on the floor once and then I go right on to the amendment. Someone has to look at that. 
If we are going to say that children are so precious--and we say that--and if we are going to say the children are 100 percent of our future--and we say that--then these children, even if they are poor children, matter as much as any other children. They are, all of these children, are a mother's child and a father's child, and they should matter. Somebody, somewhere, sometime, someplace has to get beyond the hype and look at exactly what is happening. 
Now, for the amendment supported by many colleagues who have a very different view about the welfare bill; this amendment is straightforward. What it does is it allows States to permit 24 months of vocational and postsecondary education as work activity. I will explain what this means. And, in addition, it removes teens from the 30 percent education cap. 
Two issues: The States have a cap as to how many citizens they can count as working if they are going to school, and teenagers are included. In a way, the teenagers should not be included because the given is we want teenagers to complete their high school education. I think that is pretty simple and straightforward, and that will help a lot of our States out as they try to work through the work participation requirements. 
The second thing this amendment says is, for any State that wants to--and there is no mandate at all--for any State that wants to, you can allow a mother to be able to complete 2 years of education. 
This is extremely important. Senator Levin began this effort last summer when he offered a similar amendment to the Balanced Budget Act. His amendment would have expanded the current law to permit 24 months of vocational education. 
I commend his efforts. 
I remind colleagues that there were 55 votes in favor of the amendment. Since that time, more data, more reports, more anecdotal evidence has emerged reinforcing the need to make this modification. In other words, we want to give States more flexibility with their welfare plans. 
We have to make this modification, because right now what is happening is that in too many cases States don't have the flexibility and, therefore, women, single parents with small children who are on the path to economic self-sufficiency because they are going to school, are essentially being driven out of school. This is crazy. We shouldn't do this. 
If we can at least put into effect this modification, which I think will have strong support, we will enable these women and these mothers to go on through the 2 years of education. We will enable the States to have the flexibility. No State is required to; it is up to the States. These women will be in a much better position to be economically sufficient. 
I will provide a lot of data, I say to my colleagues. If the Senator from Illinois is here to speak on the amendment--I know he is an original cosponsor. Has the Senator come to speak on the amendment? I will give an introduction and then defer to my colleague because we are going to finish up soon. 
Mr. President, what I am simply saying to colleagues is, I think this modification just makes all the sense in the world. Right now what happens is you have a State that is under pressure with all the work participation requirements. The State doesn't feel like it has the flexibility to give these mothers this option. And so you have this kind of bitterly ironic situation where a mother, a single parent, with two small children in college is forced out of college. She gets a $6-an-hour job with no benefits. One year later, she loses her medical assistance, and she and her children are far worse off, as opposed to--and I will provide a lot of data to support this--as opposed to what happens when this woman, this mother can complete her education. 
There is no mandate. What we are saying is that if my State of Minnesota or the State of Illinois or the State of Vermont or the State of Massachusetts or the State of Alabama so desires, or the State of Kentucky--my colleague, Senator Ford, has been very active on this--then they can do so. 
The question is, When these mothers are on the path to economic self-sufficiency, why do we want to take them off that path? I recently heard from a mother, Camille Martinson, who is a single mother with two children on the verge of completing a nursing degree. But fearing she will be unable to do so--her words best express the frustration she is now feeling and highlights, I think, the importance of the amendment. I quote from the letter that Camille sent me:  
With this infant program-- 
That is our welfare program in Minnesota-- They are forcing me to work a $5.15 per hour job. But if I was to graduate as a nurse, I will work for pay of over $10 per hour or higher. I am almost ready to graduate but it's damn near impossible with all these demands on me. If I didn't love my children so much that I want to provide them and give them a good life, I would have quit school and flipped burgers for eternity. I guess that's what the State may be forced to have me do. It sure seems like it. I want to make something out of my life for me and my children and succeed in life but won't at this rate. 
These are her words, a direct quote: 
Please help me with these issues as I see no other way out. It is hell for me. I guess you have to be in my shoes to know exactly how I feel and what I'm going through. I don't like the way this program is set up. It is a lose-lose situation. I can't win no matter what I do. The system I'm currently working on will make me fail no matter what I do. When I speak on these issues I'm not only speaking for myself, but many thousands of others are having similar problems that I do. 
I have a lot to lay out on this amendment. I yield the floor to my colleague from Illinois who was gracious enough to come down and speak on this.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I know we are going to take a break in a moment. I say to my colleagues, if you don't have debate and want to support this amendment, I won't talk that long. I am ready to go forward with it. I don't know what my colleagues have heard. I believe both of them are supporters. 
I will simply summarize right now. There is a lot of data I can present later on about the difference an associate degree makes in terms of an economic situation for a family. 
I want to pick up on one comment my colleague from Illinois made. I can't even begin to recount the number of community colleges I have been at where maybe there are 300 students. I know about 20 percent are single parents, many welfare mothers. Over and over again, the plea that I hear is, `Please let me finish my education; please let me get my 2-year degree, because I will be in such a better position to support myself and my children.' 
I think if a State wants to allow a mother to do so, and her family will be much better off, we ought to give States that flexibility. I believe our States are saying that, I believe the community colleges are saying that and these families are saying that. 
I have a list of about 70 different organizations--120 organizations--that are saying that. So I hope we will adopt this amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask the manager, my colleague, the chairman, I have much to say if we are going on and there is debate. If there is support for this, I am prepared to urge its adoption. Does my colleague know? Is there opposition?

I want to be clear one more time, this just gives the States the flexibility to allow a mother who is in college or wants to go to college for 2 years, to be able to do that and not be penalized for it. No State has to adopt this amendment. It is entirely up to the judgment of the States. But right now we have a situation where States face penalties and they are put in a position of having to drive some of these women out of school where they could do so much better in terms of employment, so much better in terms of jobs. There is a wealth of evidence that I could go into, but I think we want to go to a vote. 
This is the right thing to do. This is a terribly important initiative supported by many Senators who supported the welfare bill, and I hope there will be a very strong vote for it.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Let me just say to my colleague from West Virginia that it was an honor to work with him on this amendment. I thank him for his eloquence and for all that he does in the Senate. 
Mr. President, other colleagues are here--two colleagues. I am going to be quite brief. I am going to speak briefly about an amendment I was going to offer, and then I was going to ask unanimous consent my slot be eliminated. I wonder if that will be in order.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I will be very brief, because there are amendments that we have in the evening ahead of us. Let me simply talk about a conversation I had with Nils Hasselmo, who was president of the University of Minnesota and dropped by my office yesterday. He works with the American Association of Universities. He said, `Look, Paul, I rather you not do this amendment. We in the higher education community want to work with you.' If so, fine. 
I want to refer for a moment to a report. This was the Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates titled `Reinventing Undergraduate Education: A Blueprint for America's Research Universities.' This was dedicated in memory of Ernest Boyer, who had been president of the Carnegie Foundation. Many of us knew Ernest Boyer as a visionary concerning education. 
What concerns me about this report that came out a few months ago--and there were quite a few front-page stories about it--is the findings. 
To be very brief, the findings go as follows: That in all too many of our large research universities, undergraduates go to these schools and their tuition is applied, of course, to the finances of these universities. They go in part because they hear about some of the university professors who have excellent reputations, but they never see them as teachers in their classes. It is not uncommon for undergraduates, first-year students--basically in their first year--to hardly have any professors--associate or full professors. It does seem to me if our universities and colleges are going to say they have a teaching mission, then there has to be some way that they live up to that mission. 
I could go on for hours and hours, but let me simply say that as an undergraduate many years ago, I experienced this. I have been a rebel about this forever. I think it is just simply unacceptable that in so many of our large research institutions, the graduate students are the priority, and the truth of the matter is, the undergraduates are not. I think when parents send their children--women and men--to go to higher education institutions, they have every right to expect that there will be a real emphasis on teaching to go along with that emphasis on research and that, indeed, in their first year, these students will have a chance to have some of these professors as teachers. That is what is wrong. 
I was going to speak to this in an amendment. When I talked with Nils Hasselmo and talked with others in the higher education community, we agreed to bring some presidents together, bring some higher education people together and go through this and see what kind of changes can be made. 
I know that Mark Yudof at the University of Minnesota is doing some very good work to try and put more of an emphasis on what happens to first-year students, and I think some of that is 
coming from the higher education community. 
I have to say, I didn't offer the amendment tonight, but I really want to see some changes take place here, and I believe there are many other Senators who will as well. The higher education community has to be accountable. There is a whole lot of Federal grant money that goes to these institutions. With all due respect, I think we have a right to say, `Look, we want to make sure that you don't just give lip service to teaching.' 
By way of conclusion, I want to mention what was in this Carnegie report as a kind of, if you will, bill of rights for students which gives us some direction, some sense of direction that I think the universities can go on:

Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Indiana, who is on the floor, my understanding is that we reached an accommodation or compromise when it comes to higher education and `minor sports.' We will have the GAO study that will go forward. And, in addition, we already have language in the bill that does call for a disclosure of financial information as to what is spent on different sports on the campuses. I think that is really important to a lot of us who were involved in some of these `minor sports.' And I see those sports being cut right now in our institutions of higher learning. 
I thank my colleagues for their accommodation. They seem ready to speak. I said I would be brief. I am done, I say to the Senator from Maine. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for his remarks. For a moment, I want to respond to some of what my colleague from Arizona said. He need not stay, but I did want to amplify on some of his remarks. 
I have had the honor of being able to work closely with Congresswoman Pelosi, who I think has been a very courageous leader in the human rights area. I have worked with a lot of human rights organizations, and Wei Jingsheng and others in China, who have had the courage to speak up. I, too, want to give credit where credit is due. I think it is terribly important that the President speak out about human rights--terribly important. I think it was perhaps even more important that this was on television and radio and people in China had an opportunity to hear this discussion. 
I also believe, however, that really the question is, What next? I think that is really the question in regard to the whole issue of weapons of mass destruction and exporting of technology --dangerous technologies--in regard to trade. I think last year China exported something like $40 billion worth of products to our country and we exported $15 billion to China. That is clearly a policy that doesn't serve the people in our country well at all. 
I think also in the human rights area, which is very near and dear to my heart, I wish the President had met with some of the human rights advocates in China. I wish he had met with some of the families of the victims of Tiananmen Square or, for that matter, of those who are now in prison. But most important, on the `what next' part, I really hope that we will see some changes. There are, at minimum, some 2,000 men and women in prison in China just for the practice of their religion or because they have spoken out; many have spoken out for democracy, which is what we cherish in our country. We just celebrated 222 years of our noble experiment in self-rule. Those prisoners of conscience should be released. 
We meet all the time in our country very courageous men and women, now living in the United States of America. Many of them can't go back to China. They have been `blacklisted.' They should be able to go back to their country. It is not enough to say, because the Government released Wei Jingsheng, who served 16, 17, 18 years in prison because he had the courage to stand alone and to speak out for democracy, that this represents progress, because he is now in exile. He can't go back to his country to see his family, to see his loved ones. 
Quite clearly, the discussion about Tibet was good, but what we absolutely have to see are some negotiations with the Dalai Lama, a specific timetable to put an end to what has been absolute pressure on the people in Tibet. Last year, things got worse in Tibet. There has been no improvement whatsoever in human rights. Every time I have an opportunity to speak out about human rights on the floor of the Senate, I don't miss that opportunity. 
I say to the President that I appreciated someone who was pushing and pushing the President to speak out on human rights. I am glad he did. I think the credit should be given to the President for raising a lot of other terribly important questions that deal with our national security and our national defense. I also believe, however, in the human rights equation, which I think should be part of the foundation of our foreign policy. The whole way we need to measure the success of the President's trip is, what next? What next? The proof will be in the pudding. We have to wait and see. We have to continue to press and press and press.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know I am going to be joined on the floor in a moment. I had a chance to speak earlier today on the floor of the Senate. But unless there is some tabling motion--and there may not be opportunity for full debate and discussion--I told my colleague from Washington that I would just begin to speak about an issue that she is going to raise on the floor of the Senate. I guess the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, will also speak to this because he has been raising this question over and over again. The three of us really have focused on this. 
This, again, has to do with what I talked about earlier today on the floor of the Senate--compensation to veterans with tobacco-related illnesses. 
There was the hope on the part of the veterans community--the Chair, I think, would be interested in this--that there would be compensation to veterans having to do with addiction to tobacco. That is to say, in many ways it was handed out like candy. These veterans say, `Look, if there are going to be rules for compensation, the same rules should apply to us.' That seems fair to deal with some of the health care struggles and illnesses with which they have to deal. 
That was the first preference. I want to go on to add--now I am speaking for myself--if not direct compensation for veterans, then at least the money that is saved by not providing that compensation should go to veterans. The Office of Management and Budget, I think, estimated savings of something like $17 billion. I personally think that is too high an estimate, but that is a whole other issue. But if not the $17 billion for compensation, then at least it seems to me that money ought to go to veterans' health care. 
I could spend hours and hours--I will not--talking about all the ways in which veterans fall between the cracks. I actually found this to be, I think, probably the greatest education I have had since I have been a U.S. Senator, having to do with my dealings with veterans. I have been just amazed by how much veterans really need health care coverage, and it is not provided; veterans that are homeless; veterans struggling with PTSD, on and on. I think there is a whole lot that needs to be done. 
Let me say to those who follow veterans' health care issues that we have a flat-line budget that does not take into account really the inflation in medical costs, and I don't think takes into account demography, because more veterans are living to older age. We have a reliance on third-party payments that I am not sure is going to come through. If we ever get back to the VA housing bill--I hope we will--I will have an amendment that deals with that. We have, as I said before, a population that is living to be 85 and beyond, and I don't think we have figured out yet what to do about that. 
We also have the problem of compensation for atomic veterans who have been waiting years for justice. I intend to be out here with a piece of legislation for an up-or-down vote on this. These are men and women that went to ground zero in Nevada and Utah without any protective gear. So many of them have died from 
cancer. So many of their children and grandchildren have had illnesses. So many of them have struggled. We should expand the list of radiogenic diseases that are covered, that are presumptive diseases, because they still aren't getting compensation. It was a terrible thing the government did. It was a terrible thing. We lied to them. They should have been given protective gear. They should have been told what they were going to be exposed to. They weren't. 
My point is that on each and every one of these issues, whether they get direct compensation or not, at the very least that money ought to be put into veterans' health care. Instead, what happened is when the ISTEA highway bill went from the Senate to the House, all of a sudden a whole bunch of new projects got added on. The question becomes, How can we afford it? What is the `offset'? For those watching this discussion on the floor of the Senate, that means, Where do you get the money from? Where the money was taken from was the $17 billion that the veterans community thought would, in fact, go to direct compensation for them and their families, or at the very least would go into veterans' health care. That is exactly what happened. That is what happened on the bill. 
When that bill came back here, when it passed the Senate, I voted against that bill. Then for complicated reasons there were some changes that needed to be made in a technical correction bill, and Senator Rockefeller stepped forward. I was pleased to join him. And he said, `Look, when that technical correction bill comes before the floor of the Senate, I will have an amendment to essentially knock out the provision that took $17 billion, or however you score it, away from the veterans community.' We went through a debate on this. We reached an impasse. 
The majority leader then decided the way he would deal with this is we would just put the technical corrections for the highway bill in the IRS conference report. So this conference committee dealing with this Internal Revenue Service bill essentially took the technical corrections for ISTEA and put it into the IRS conference report, which means we can't amend it. 
So when Senator Murray comes to the floor of the Senate, she is going to be, I think, appealing the ruling of the Chair. She is going to talk about what happened having been outside the scope of the IRS conference committee. In other words, there was no chance for discussion on the technical corrections bill about what happens to veterans compensation and health care, and so on and so forth. The technical corrections just got put into the IRS conference committee. 
So we will have that debate on the floor of the Senate. Senator Murray will be out here taking the lead. I thank her for that, because I actually think that what was done was a real injustice. 
Let me say to colleagues, I think the Congressional Budget Office scored this at about $10 billion, and then the OMB scored it at $17 billion. In some ways, it gets to be sort of funny money. But in any case, the higher figure was chosen because that gave some of our colleagues the opportunity to load more projects onto the ISTEA highway bill and gave them more of an offset. But in all due respect, I say this to all of my colleagues, the veterans community is going to hold us accountable on this. 
I hope people will listen very carefully to what Senator Murray has to say, and I hope we have an initiative similar to the initiative which Senator Dorgan took. And we will have a very strong vote. 
For my own part, if we don't win on this--and I hope we do--I think it ought to go back to conference committee. I think this provision dealing with the technical corrections should be knocked out because I think we should have a separate vote on the technical corrections bill. Then we should be able to come out here with an amendment and have an up-or-down vote as to whether or not the $17 billion that should have gone to compensation for veterans and their families, or at least into health care for the veterans community, should or should not be there as opposed to transferring it to the highway bill. 
That is the issue. There is no way people here are going to be able to avoid it. One way or another, I think people are going to hear from the veterans community. And they should hear from the veterans community. 
So we will shortly, when Senator Murray returns, have this discussion. I assume that this question will be before the Senate. 
For my own part, if we don't win, though I hope we do win, I think what I want to do is keep coming back over and over again and basically raise the same question and forcing votes. We can have the same votes over and over and over again. People can play around this however they want to. People can vote against the proposition that we honestly ought to have taken the $17 billion that should have gone for veterans' compensation and health care and kept it there, or people can vote whether it should be transferred to the highway bill for different projects that were added on in the House. We should have a strong vote in the Senate on this question. Or people can vote one way, and then kind of just look the other way while in the conference committee it gets done. 
But regardless of what we do procedurally, regardless of what we do process-wise, I want to remind colleagues one more time on the floor of the Senate that this was a real injustice. I don't know how people justify it. I don't know how people justify it. 
First issue: The veterans community says, `Look, if we are going to be talking about compensation for people who are addicted to tobacco, do you know what happened to us when we were serving our country? Cigarettes were handed out to us like candy.' 
So we asked for some compensation. We are paying the price for that addiction to tobacco. We asked for the compensation. They don't get the compensation. Then I say, and I think other veterans say this as well, if not the direct compensation, at least over the next 5 years put it into veterans' health care. Put it into the veterans' health care system. There is not one Senator here who spends any time back in his or her State with the veterans community who doesn't know that this is a system in need of reform. Dr. Kizer has moved forward with some good initiatives; some other initiatives I question. I think he has provided good leadership. But we should be doing much, much more. Much, much more. 
What about Vietnam vets? More drop-in centers? Senator Akaka has done a great job of leading the way for drop-in centers for Vietnam vets and other veterans. What about other veterans who struggle with post-traumatic stress syndrome? What about veterans who are homeless, many of them struggling with substance abuse? What about elderly veterans? What about veterans who fall between the cracks, and they don't have a direct service-connected disability illness and they are not low-income and therefore they are not eligible? And so on and so forth. 
This is a system that needs to be put on a more solid financial footing. This is a system that needs to do better by way of veterans. This is a health care system that faces many challenges. And what we did is we took the $17 billion that should have been direct compensation for these veterans who are addicted to tobacco--or at a minimum should have been put into veterans' health care--and we used the money to offset the cost of a whole variety of different projects, mainly highway projects added on to the ISTEA bill in the House of Representatives. And then when Senator Rockefeller and some of the rest of us wanted to amend the technical corrections bill to knock out that transfer of funds away from the veterans community to highways, we never had the opportunity to do so. The majority leader didn't want an up-or-down vote. 
You can do all you want with procedure and process. But you still have to be held accountable. But instead, we got another end run. We have the technical corrections bill folded into the conference report, completely outside the scope, as far as I can see, of any IRS reform bill, thus denying us the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. 
Senator Murray will come here and challenge that, saying it was beyond the scope of the conference committee, and we will vote on this issue. I look forward to when she comes out in the Chamber and when we have that vote. And I say to colleagues, please, focus your attention on what was done, because I do not see how we explain this away to people in the veterans community. 
I hope I am not boring people with this argument. I keep repeating it over and over again, but I don't see how you explain to people that the money which should have gone to them by way of compensation--and, as a second choice, at least into their health care system--instead got transferred to paying for people's highway projects. 
Does anybody want to debate anybody in the veterans community about this? Does anybody want to defend this in any VFW hall or American Legion hall? How about the Vietnam Vets of America? How about the Paralyzed Veterans of America? How about the Disabled American Veterans? How about the Atomic Veterans? How about the Military Order of the Purple Heart? Do any of my colleagues want to defend this? I think this is a tough one, and I hope that we can take corrective action. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my colleagues a couple of issues that relate to this IRS conference report that is before us. 
First of all, my colleague from North Carolina was conveying a message to labor. He was talking about the fact that he was going to be very vigilant and he was going to be watching closely what happens with the oversight board. I think we should be vigilant and pay attention to what happened in this conference committee. 
I bring a couple of matters to the attention of my colleagues. I, first of all, will start out talking about veterans. I know that my colleague from West Virginia, who has been such a powerful advocate for veterans, will also speak about this, and I understand my colleague from Washington will be on the floor later taking action, and I will be pleased to join her. 
Let me go through this very briefly. As the highway bill--called the ISTEA or TEA-21 bill--moved to the House, and Members of the House wanted to add on more projects, the question was how to fund it. The way it was funded was to take an estimate from the Office of Management and Budget having to do with whether or not there would be compensation to veterans for illnesses caused by their addiction to tobacco. Cigarettes were handed out like candy to veterans when they were in the service. 
The decision was made that veterans should not receive this compensation. OMB said this would lead to a savings of about $17 billion. I think CBO said more like $10 billion, but conferees used the $17 billion. That money, I say to my colleagues, if not going to direct compensation for veterans, at the very least should go to veterans' health care. 
I cannot even tell you how many calls we get in our Minnesota office from veterans. It is really shocking the number of veterans who fall between the cracks. We have an aging veterans population. We don't know what to do as more veterans reach the age of 85 or how they will be taken care of in the veterans' health care system. We have Vietnam vets suffering with PTSD who drop in our office who still need a lot of help. A third of the homeless people in this country are veterans, many struggling with substance abuse, who need help. We have a VA health care system that has been put on a flat-line budget that won't work. We are talking about whether or not we are going to live up to our commitment to veterans. 
There was a technical corrections bill to this highway bill. Senator Rockefeller and I intended to have an amendment knocking out this $17 billion transfer of funds that should be going to veterans and instead was put into the highway bill. That is correct, I say to my colleagues, that is exactly what happened. I didn't vote for the bill for that reason. 
The majority leader did not want to afford us the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on our amendment on the technical corrections bill. So he took the technical corrections bill and had the conferees put this into the IRS conference report. Therefore, we can't amend it. 
I bring to the attention of my colleagues that this was outside the scope of conference, as I see it. I think Senator Murray and others will have more to say about this. 
Certainly, in this IRS reform bill that passed the Senate and the House, we didn't do this, but in the conference report, things were loaded on, and one of them was essentially this technical corrections bill that did not give us the opportunity to knock out this transfer--OMB says $17 billion; I think that is too high. That $17 billion either should have gone directly into compensation for veterans, vis-a-vis their tobacco addiction, or at the very least should have gone into veterans' health care. 
Therefore, questions should be raised about this conference report that is before us. I say to my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, the VA-HUD appropriations bill, of course, has been pulled. But the first opportunity I get, I will be back with an amendment to knock out this provision that took $17 billion, or thereabouts, that should have gone to veterans and instead put it into highway projects. We will come back to this, and we will have an up-or-down vote. First point. 
Second point. Boy, I will tell you, conference committees! I say to my colleague from Wyoming, I used to teach political science classes. 
I have to tell you. You know, I feel guilty. I need to refund tuition to students for those 2 weeks I taught classes on the Congress. I was so off in terms of a lot of the decisionmaking. 
I should have focused on the conference committees as the third House of the Congress, because these folks can do any number of different things. And the thing that drives me crazy is you can have a situation where the Senate did not have a provision in the bill, the House did not have a provision in the bill, and the conference committee just puts it in the bill. Then it comes back for an up-or-down vote. No opportunity to amend. 
Or you can have a situation where the Senate and the House pass bills with a provision in them and the conference takes it out. It is, I think, the least accountable part of decisionmaking in the Congress.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Chairman Archer wanted to make sure that for those Americans with estates worth more than $17 million, that we give them a special break. That is correct. Those Americans who are struggling with estates worth more than $17 million, they got, roughly speaking, an additional $200,000 break by mistake in last year's budget bill. The Senate corrected that mistake, but the correction got taken out in this conference committee. 
I hear my colleagues talk about IRS reform. How does that add up to reform? We have these Orwellian titles. We call everything `reform.' To most people in the country, when they find out about it, they do not think it is reform. We have paycheck protection that does not protect the paycheck; we have the Family Friendly Workplace Act which isn't friendly to the family; we have the TEAM Act which has nothing to do with teamwork, so on and so forth. Now this is called reform, and we give this break to folks with estates worth more than $17 million.

Mr. WELLSTONE. So now we have an addition, in the dark of night, where the conference committee sneaks in another indefensible tax cut to wealthy people. That was not the bill that passed out of the Senate. I do not think it was in the House version. But in the conference committee it was put in. 
So, colleagues, I think there will be another effort on the floor, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues in doing this--with Senator Dorgan and others--which will essentially say this is outside the scope of conference. It was not passed by either body and should not be in there. We will have a ruling by the Chair, and maybe we will have an up-or-down vote. 
But I just point out that while there are some very good things in this piece of legislation--my colleague from Nebraska was one of the leaders in this effort with very, very good things that people around the country appreciate. But then we go to the conference committee, and we have a couple things that happen which are not democratic, with a small `d,' not accountable, not decisionmaking that I think makes a whole lot of sense. 
To the veterans, I say on the floor of the Senate: count on my support, working with Senator Rockefeller, working with Senator Murray, and working with others to, one way or another, try to knock out this transfer of funding, however it is estimated, $17 billion or less, that should be going to veterans in direct compensation or should be going to veterans' health care, as opposed to being put into the highway bill for different projects. 
And the second thing I want to bring to everyone's attention is cuts in capital gains for the wealthy, in the dark of night, added in the conference committee. And then finally the estate tax break--and I see my colleague from Nebraska here--which was actually corrected in the Senate bill and then dropped in conference. So we had a correction which would not have given the break to these poor folks with estates worth $17 million and more. And it could have easily been put in the conference committee. That is what we did on the Senate side. But, no, it was dropped. 
So, colleagues, we are going to, I think, have some debate and some action on the floor this afternoon on this. I will be pleased to join other colleagues on both of these questions. And before you start calling this a reform bill, take a very close look at what was added to this bill, or what was dropped from this bill, in the conference. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a significant milestone: the Minnesota-based Children's Program of Northern Ireland is celebrating its 25th anniversary this summer. 
This important program began in 1973 when one nine-year-old from Belfast, David Hughes, traveled to Minnesota and stayed with Roy and Ruth Lerud of Twin Valley. 
From this simple beginning, wondrous things have happened. 
During the following summer, Rotary Clubs in Hibbing, Minnesota, and Belfast, Northern Ireland, joined together to bring 120 children, ages 10-11, to Minnesota host families. 
And now, 25 years later, the program can boast that more than 4,000 children have come to Minnesota and neighboring states. These children have had their lives touched in immeasurable ways. And they have touched the lives of untold thousands of Minnesotans. 
The Children's Program of Northern Ireland was the first of its kind in the nation. It is now the blueprint of 25 other, similar programs throughout America which bring children to Minnesota for a summer of peace and understanding. 
Something important is at work here--Minnesotans are working to bring about peace, one child at a time. When the good people of Minnesota got involved in this program 25 years ago it was because they saw the need and stepped in to fill it. There were no Presidential Commissions or calls by Congress asking citizens to become involved. Rather, there were everyday heroes and heroines who tried to make their world better by opening their homes to a child from a troubled part of the world. 
And they have succeeded. 
Rotary is proud, and rightly so, of its motto `Service Above Self.' The Hibbing Rotary Club and the Belfast Rotary Club, in 1974, were living embodiments of this motto, as are all the people throughout Minnesota and Northern Ireland whose hard work and dedication have made this program such an enduring success. 
From the beginning these selfless efforts have been driven by volunteers. I would like to recognize, on the floor of the United States Senate, two of those volunteers. Hazel Busby is the coordinator in Belfast. She has been a tireless and enthusiastic volunteer for many, many years. I also would like to recognize Kathy Schultz, who is the current American board president. Both of these women merit the highest recognition for their contributions toward achieving peace in our time. 
None of us can know exactly how significant these Minnesota efforts have been in bringing peace and understanding to our world. However, we can know that the work of these fine people has brought a large measure of peace and understanding to untold thousands on both sides of the Atlantic. And that, in and of itself, merits recognition and highest praise.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I introduce this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer. This amendment focuses on a real need in our Armed Forces. Really, we are talking about the children. We are talking about the need to have comprehensive child care for our families who serve in our Armed Forces who, after all, are involved in very important service for our Nation. 
Back in the 1980s this body began looking at the state of child care. Thanks to the leadership of Senator Kennedy, funding was appropriated to build child-care centers that provided new services to families of military personnel. Subsequently, the Department of Defense's child-care programs have been able to provide quality--by the way, this is a model for the Nation--quality service to thousands of children of military personnel. But, by 1995, we find out that there is really a tremendous need, 
and while there are some 299,000 children served, there are 155,000 children of families that are requesting child-care services. This amendment is an effort to bridge this gap. 
For the parents of these 144,000 children--really, close to 155,000 children--requesting this, this is a huge issue. It is difficult to do well when you are worried about whether or not your children have good care, and this amendment speaks to this problem. If you don't have peace of mind while you are serving our country, if you don't believe your child is receiving good care, what we are trying to do is provide the necessary family support services. 
There are a variety of different components that we are talking about. We are talking about, of course, early childhood development. That is to say, when both parents are working and you are trying to figure out what you are going to do with your child--and, look, for our military personnel, but also for all of our families--when both of you have to work, you know full well that the most important thing is to make sure that your child is receiving good child care. But for too many citizens in our country, and for too many military families, they are not able to fill that need. This amendment takes us a long way toward filling that need. 
In addition, there is the issue of afterschool care for younger children who are going home, but going home alone, again, when both parents have to work, trying to fill that very important need for military personnel; or there are occasions when there is a place to drop a child off from time to time when a parent or parents need to do so. Now, it is not free. What we have is a sliding fee scale basis of child care right now within the military, which is the way I think it should be done. Actually, the average fee is about $65 per child per week. It ranges from $35 to $88. 
The funding for the child development program of the Department of Defense is about $295 million. About 52 percent of the children have been served. What we are now trying to do is move toward serving the children for the vast majority of these families by, over a year period, increasing the appropriations by $270 million.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Department of Defense had its own internal study in 1995. I agree with my colleague from Michigan in his praise of our Secretary of Defense and his commitment. 
I don't think the Secretary of Defense would disapprove of this body taking yet another step forward in this area. 
We had an internal study in 1995 where the DOD essentially said, `Look, we can only satisfy 52 percent of the need for child care of families in the armed services.' I am looking at almost 50 percent of the families not able to get the care for their children that they need. As far as how we do this, we are very clear that this gets phased in over a period of time. 
As I said to my colleagues, we start next fiscal year with the $41 million, and then we gradually increase it, so that by the year 2003 it is $70 million. Overall it is $270 million, one-tenth of 1 percent of the overall budget. There have been plenty of studies that say we spend way more than that in administrative ways. 
I cannot believe that the Secretary of Defense, or certainly anybody who is involved with the Department of Defense child care program, would not say, `Senators, if you are willing to take one-tenth of 1 percent across the board, and you will earmark that for expanding child care services so that we can meet the needs of 155,000 children and their families, we are for it.' 
I again appeal to my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. If my colleagues have essentially yielded their time, or may now reserve some of their time, let me try to summarize it. 
Let me try to make this appeal again. We have a 1995 study which says, `Look, almost 50 percent of the families are hurting here. They need the child care services.' I have a Congressional Research Service study that says the same thing. We phase it in over a 5-year period. It is a total of $270 million, one-tenth of 1 percent of the overall Pentagon budget. 
Isn't part of our readiness making sure that these families of our military personnel can feel secure that their children are getting good child care? Can't we do this in our budget for our military families? 
The medical evidence is overwhelming about the importance of early childhood development. It is overwhelming about the development of the brain. It is overwhelming that we ought to do better. This amendment enables us to do this. I guess I am disappointed in the opposition, although, of course, everybody has a right to take whatever view they want to. 
I make yet one final appeal to my colleagues to please support this amendment. It is eminently reasonable, eminently balanced, and it really does a world of good for military families. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me be clear to my colleagues. I believe in the basic discussion I have had that a lot of the men and women in personnel who are involved, I say to my colleagues, who are actually involved down in the trenches delivering child care programs within the Department of Defense child care program, will tell you, `Senator, $270 million over 5 years would do us a world of good, because we have almost 50 percent of the families we can't serve.' 
My colleague can get a statement from the director saying, `Look, we are not in favor of this.' I mean that can be the position that the Department takes. That is the position that maybe someone who administers the program takes. But with all due respect, I have here a Congressional Research Service report. I will quote. This backs up the internal 1995 DOD report.  
In the 1995 survey, potential need for all the services is estimated to be 299,278 child care spaces. Given that there are currently 155,311 spaces, DOD is meeting about 52 percent of the total potential need. 
My colleagues come here to the floor and they say there is already a plan to meet this need. But there isn't a plan to meet this need. We are talking about a gap of 48 percent. 
I will say it one more time. Just ask the families. Just talk to the families. Ask that 48 percent what it feels like to not have adequate child care, what it feels like when you both have to work and you don't know whether your child is in really good child care, what it feels like when you are both working and your child comes home alone from school. 
We could do a world of good. The evidence is clear. There is a huge gaping need here. 
With all due respect, whatever official positions we get from DOD on this, the fact of the matter is, I think, the evidence is irrefutable. We have a 48 percent gap, and for 1 penny of 1 dollar, one-tenth of 1 percent across the board, look at the studies on administrative waste. We could put $270 million into child care for our military families and meet a huge need. That is the issue. 
I hope there will be strong support for this amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just say to my colleagues, this is one-tenth of 1 percent, and we have studies on administrative waste within the Department of Defense. That is my point. It is hard to believe that we could not take one penny out of $1 of the overall budget and put it into child care to make sure that these families are able to receive the support that they deserve. With almost a 50-percent gap, according to CRS, a waiting list of 93,000 families for child care, this is a great opportunity to help a lot of military families in probably the most important way we can. All of us who have been parents and grandparents know that. So I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President today I am introducing an amendment that will show the heart and hands of our government in caring for the victims of domestic violence in the military. 
My amendment is simple: it will provide health benefits for abused dependents of members of the armed forces, who are currently receiving transitional compensation due to their batterer's discharge or court martial for abuse. These health benefits include medical, dental, and mental health care at armed forces facilities. Victims, battered women and abused children, would be entitled to health benefits for as long as they received transitional compensation, which is a maximum of three years. The financial expense would be negligible; but the increased care, safety and dignity given to our military dependents who are victims of abuse would be huge. 
Domestic violence is one of the most serious issues we face. It knows no borders. Neither economic status, geography, or race shields someone from domestic violence. It is happening to women in your families, your neighborhoods, and in your place of work and worship. Most distressing, it is happening at an alarming rate in military families. 
Battering is the one of the single greatest causes of injury to women. According to Department of Justice statistics, of the 1.4 million hospital emergency room admissions in 1994, about one quarter were treated for injuries from domestic violence. 
Among civilians, the DoJ has estimated that, on average each year, from 1992-1996, about 8 in 1000 women . . . age 12 or older experienced a violent victimization by a spouse or boyfriend. 
The numbers for domestic violence victims in the military are deeply disturbing and much bigger. Department of Defense data indicates 17.8 to 19.0 women per 1000 for substantiated reports of abuse during the same period. Substantiated reports of abuse are those confirmed by a military review panel. 
Many battered women and their children in the military do not come forward because they fear they will be destitute or lose key benefits if their spouses are discharged or court-martialed on the grounds of abuse. This amendment reduces the disincentives of victims to come forward about the violence in their homes. It allows dependent family members in the military to get the health services they need, so that they can escape their abusers and move toward independence. 
There have been cases brought to my attention where military dependents could have benefited from this legislation, and we know, that sadly, there are many more such stories throughout the military. 
Annette is the former wife of a Navy Chief Petty Officer and mother of two young children. She was routinely beaten by him from June 1994 through 1996. Military protective orders and civilian restraining orders failed to protect her and her children. Her ex-husband was charged with twenty-one offenses by the United States Navy, including eight assault charge involving Annette. He was ultimately court-martialed. 
Due to domestic violence, Annette has been declared ninety percent disabled by doctors and therapists. She suffers from severe skeletal and muscular damage to her back from an attempted rape by her husband; debilitating migraines due to nerve damage; dental problems as a result of her teeth being knocked out; and post traumatic stress disorder. These are just a few of her challenges while attempting to raise two children. She is receiving transitional compensation, but has had no health benefits. She has several thousands of dollars in unpaid medical bills. 
We need to ensure that military wives and dependents like Annette get the health services they need and deserve to care for their children and to heal. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a piece of legislation, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton has introduced this on the House side. This legislation is called the Strategic Transitional Employment Program, STEP. This legislation is an outgrowth of some of my work as a senator in Minnesota and in other communities around the country. 
If I had to summarize my travel in our country in Delta, MS, or East Los Angeles, or Watts, or inner-city Baltimore, or inner-city Minneapolis, or rural Minnesota, or Appalachia, Letcher County, KY, or inner-city Chicago, over and over and over again, the one thing I heard from people was: Where are the jobs at decent wages that we can support our families on? More than anything in the world, Senator, we want to be able to earn a decent living and give our children the care they need and deserve. 
Congresswoman Norton and I had the opportunity to be at First Baptist Church here in D.C. Pastor Eldridge Spearman's church, in the Greenway community, working with the Marshall Heights Community Development Organization. There was a wonderful turnout of people from the community. They said this would be the best single thing we could talk about. Over the next 4 years, an effort to create 1.8 million jobs for people, transitional employment, moving toward living-wage jobs, opportunity for education, job training, so that we build up the human capital in our communities so that we then can attract the private capital. 
This is a major issue that is off the political debate screen but should be on the political debate screen and should be part of our agenda. There is a jobs gap in our Nation now, close to 5 million jobs, and even with the economy humming along at peak economic performance, there are many communities, as the eminent scholar, William Julius Wilson, points out, where there is no work, work is the most important thing we can focus on. When people work, they contribute to family, they contribute to community, they have dignity. But there are too many communities in our country where there are almost no jobs at all. 
This legislation speaks to that. I will be bringing to the floor of the Senate some sense-of-the-Senate amendments that talk about the need to have thorough study and investigation. I will work out amendments that come from this piece of legislation, build up support, and come to the floor over and over and over again to talk about this. This is a structural problem in our economy, and this is the key to economic opportunity. 
Children do better when their parents are doing better. There is no more important priority than to focus on jobs and to focus on job opportunities. That is what this legislation does. 
I thank Brian Ahlberg, on my staff, and Deanna Caldwell for doing such superior work, and I thank the Center for Community Change, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, Peter Edelman and William Julius Wilson for their work, as well. 
The bill I introduce today, the Strategic Transitional Employment Program (STEP) Act of 1998 addresses what I consider to be one of the key moral issues facing our country. The issue is jobs. I often say that if you want to prevent crime, if you want to prevent drugs, broken homes, violence in our homes, violence in our schools and on the streets, then focus on providing all Americans with a good education, good health care and a good job. Too many Americans who want to work and are able to work cannot find a good job. 
During my recent and continuing travels, I have found that even as official unemployment figures and other leading indicators suggest that we should be celebrating our economic success, many American communities continue to struggle with the demoralization of joblessness. When I traveled last year to Mississippi, Los Angeles, Chicago, Baltimore, Kentucky, urban and rural Minnesota, and when I travel to struggling communities, neighborhoods and barrios today, I heard and still hear the question: Senator, where are all the good jobs? We want to work. We are able to work. Where are the jobs? 
Most Americans are aware that the gap between rich and poor in America is widening. Between the late 1970s and the mid 1990s, incomes of the richest fifth of families increased on average by 30 percent, or about $27,000 after adjusting for inflation. In contrast, the real incomes of the poorest families declined on average 21 percent, about $2,500. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, `In the United States as a whole, the poorest 20 percent of families with children had an average income of $9,250 in the mid-1990s, while the average income of families with children in the top 20 percent of the income distribution was $117,500, or 13 times as large.' 
In the United States today, poverty is becoming more and more concentrated, the poor are more and more isolated, and joblessness is more strongly associated with that poverty than ever before. Concentrated joblessness is increasing in urban neighborhoods and poor rural communities. Meanwhile, the joblessness is becoming more and more prolonged--a chronic condition--for residents of those areas. 
Last Friday I took part in an event at First Baptist Church in Southeast Washington, D.C. First Baptist is just across the Anacostia River on Minnesota Avenue. It serves the communities of Greenway, Marshall Heights and many others across our nation's capitol. District of Columbia Delegate Holmes-Norton and I announced that we would be introducing this bill, and I would just like to thank the church, including its pastor Eldridge Spearman, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Strayhorn and others of the church's staff for welcoming us there. Representatives of the Marshall Heights Community Development Organization also were present and participated in what I believe was an important event. 
The problem of joblessness persists today in Washington, D.C. and in communities across the country, even at a time when our economy is at peak performance. Between 4 and 5 million Americans of working age lack the jobs they need to support themselves and their families. Many have been jobless for prolonged periods. They have lost their jobs, or they have never been able to find a job. They lack the skills and experience to get a job, or there are no jobs nearby where they live. Many are so discouraged they no longer are seeking work. They are not even counted as unemployed. 
We are not talking only about those who are already or soon will be losing welfare benefits. Those people, many of them women with children, will be required to find work. We also are talking about more than a million men--African-American men in our cities, men regardless of race or background in urban and rural areas. Many jobless men are fathers. They want to work. They are able to work. But they remain jobless. 
Why has concentrated joblessness and poverty increased and intensified for some while the rest of the country is enjoying an abundance of work, when in fact in some areas there are labor shortages? There are a number of reasons, but two are fundamental: changes in the nature of work and in the location of work. Race is a third important factor. 
We have experienced profound economic restructuring that has transformed the nature of work and the skills demanded for work. Industrial and manufacturing jobs, once a foundation of our economy, have given way to work that is driven by new technological developments and a global marketplace. The demand for skilled workers, those with education and training, is high. Lower-skilled workers, who have always been the most vulnerable to economic shifts, have seen their work opportunities dwindle or vanish. The gap between average earnings of high school graduates and college graduates has become a gulf. In fact, `the unemployment rates for low-skilled men and women are five times that among their college-educated counterparts,' according to the prominent social scientist and Harvard University Professor William Julius Wilson. 
I am pleased that to say that I believe we are on the verge of completing conference work on the workforce legislation that will improve the country's job-training system. That is a crucial, bipartisan work-product of the Senate's Labor Subcommittee on Employment and Training, on which I am proud to serve as Ranking Minority Member. I am hopeful we can complete and enact that legislation in the coming weeks. The bill I introduce today is designed to fit closely with and complement that reform of the federal job-training system. It would utilize the streamlined and improved job-training infrastructure that the workforce bill is designed to bring about. 
The location of work also has changed. Business has moved to the suburbs. New jobs, even lower-skill jobs, are more likely to be found in suburban environments than central city or rural communities. In the 1980s, 87 percent of new jobs in the lower-paying and lower-skilled service and retail trade sectors were created in the suburbs, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). And all too often, jobs in the suburbs are inaccessible using public transportation. 
Race is a further determinant of concentrated poverty and joblessness. We cannot ignore or 
dismiss the impact of racial discrimination. It has created islands of poverty and joblessness. It is no coincidence that the residents of most central cities, of most poor rural counties, are more likely to be racial minorities. William Julius Wilson describes how many of our central cities have become essentially racially segregated and poor:  
In addition to changes in the economy and in the class, racial, and demographic composition of inner-city ghetto neighborhoods, certain government programs and policies contributed, over the last fifty years, to the evolution of jobless ghettos. Prominent among these are the early actions of the FHA in withholding mortgage capital from inner-city neighborhoods, the manipulation of market incentives that trapped blacks in the inner cities and lured middle-class whites to the suburbs, the construction of massive federal housing projects in inner-city neighborhoods, and, since 1980, the New Federalism, which, through its insistence on localized responses to social problems, resulted in drastic cuts in spending on basic urban programs. Just when the problems of social dislocation in jobless neighborhoods have escalated, the city has fewer resources with which to address them. 
HUD's State of the Cities report for 1997 observed that, `In 1995, the poverty rate for whites (not of Hispanic origin) was 6.4 percent; for Asians and Pacific Islanders it was 12.4 percent; African Americans, 26.4 percent; and Hispanics 27.0 percent.' 
The Eisenhower Foundation recently published a report that examines what has happened in the 30 years since the historic Kerner Commission report of 1968. Here is one finding from that report: `Since the Kerner Commission, the U.S. has had the most rapid growth in wage inequality in the Western world, with racial minorities suffering disproportionately. . . [T]here cannot be meaningful progress in closing the racial divide without an economic corollary.' 
The problem is not only urban. An American Indian in Minneapolis or a Mexican-American immigrant in Willmar, Minnesota might still not receive fair consideration from too many potential employers. With historic Civil Rights legislation through the years, we have largely transcended the most blatant policies of racial prejudice and segregation in our country. But to some degree we have replaced them with policies of inaction and neglect. Poor minorities have been made poorer, in some cases are more segregated, and many remain stereotyped. 
We pay for neglect, for the failure to act, in a myriad of ways. Neglect breeds destructive behavior that harms individuals, that harms those in close proximity, and that eventually harms those far removed. Criminal behavior is a child of neglect. We know that there are strong relationships between poverty, unemployment, and crime. Work deters the kind of crime that is found in communities of concentrated joblessness and poverty. It may not be all that is needed, but legitimate work opportunity is integral. Without it there is no hope. 
The STEP proposal would build a bridge to close the `jobs gap'--the gap between those who are doing well in today's economy and those who are being left behind. The problem in this case is not the cyclical nature of our economy. It is chronic and structural joblessness. We cannot any longer disregard the substantial portion of our population that is being left out of the benefits of general prosperity. 
The Center for Community Change estimates a jobs gap of about 4.4 million. In other words, 4.4 million people are out of work or economically in need of additional employment due to a lack of jobs appropriate to their skills and abilities. The estimate includes about 2.1 million of the officially unemployed who have been without work for 15 weeks or longer. It also includes about 330,000 persons who are without work but have given up their employment search and are therefore no longer officially unemployed--also called the discouraged worker. And it includes about 2 million full-time equivalent positions, which represent the nearly 4 million `economically underemployed,' people who work part-time because they cannot find a full-time job and who are also not included in the count of the officially unemployed. 
The answer to the jobs gap is jobs, and our bill will create jobs--1.8 million of them over three years. The idea for this legislative proposal comes from people who have devoted much of their professional lives to attempting to solve this problem: the Center for Community Change, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, Peter Edelman, William Julius Wilson and grassroots organizations around the country which serve low-income communities. Our bill will not create every permanent job that is needed. Massive job-creation programs have been proposed and even tried in the past. They usually were designed as counter-cyclical interventions in the economy to address recessions. We also acknowledge that there are other reasons for joblessness which our bill does not directly address. If there are no jobs nearby, part of the solution may be transportation. If a jobless person is a parent, part of the solution may be affordable, quality child care. 
Rather, the bill proposes for the first time a specific and limited policy tool to address a specific, crucial need. It is a realistic effort to provide for out-of-work individuals a transition between chronic joblessness and a non-subsidized job in the private or public sector. It is a serious, even if initial and partial, effort to close the jobs gap. What I propose today is a plan to provide nearly 2 million Americans with a significant step toward a full-time, living wage job. 
It will help these jobless individuals living in poverty with meaningful employment experience for one year, as well as with skills-training and education. 
It will provide hard-hit communities with needed economic development and services so they can attract more investment. 
It will prepare workers who, at the end of a year of skills-developing work, can qualify for many of the positions that private employers are telling us they cannot fill because they can't find able and experienced workers. That also will help attract investment. 
Finally, it will create a new demonstration program at the Small Business Administration to help target venture-capital investment to small enterprises that provide jobs in high-unemployment, high-poverty communities. 
The core of the bill is a 4-year, $20-billion program to create 1.8 million entry-level, 12-month, transitional jobs. These will be community employment jobs, filling needs in the affected communities. The program would be administered by the Department of Labor, largely through the existing federal employment and training infrastructure, which we are in the midst of reforming and improving in substantial ways. Money and decision-making power would be pushed down to the local level. Participation by key groups--employers, labor, elected officials and community-based organizations--would be assured. 
We are not simply providing make-work jobs leading to nowhere. State and local plans would have to specify how the jobs and the accompanying skills development would provide a transition to gainful employment after one year. Nor are we creating an exploited, low-wage workforce to displace current workers or undercut their wages, such as many allege is happening with Welfare-to-Work in some places. Strict anti-displacement language is included in the bill. Workers in the program would be paid slightly above minimum wage, plus benefits, and would receive full federal labor law protections. 
The program would be paid for from discretionary funds, so no budgetary offset would be required for its enactment. Nonetheless, offsets are included in the bill. It would be paid for by eliminating unnecessary current spending. The bill would revoke the current subsidy of excessive executive compensation among large American corporations--prohibiting the federal tax deduction for salaries paid to executives which are more than 25 times the compensation of another employee of the same company for the same year. And it would repeal the deferral of income tax owed on assets of U.S.-controlled foreign corporations. 
Here is how the bill would work. 
The STEP Act would provide transitional employment to place people firmly on the pathway to economic security. 
The STEP Act would provide funding over four years to create entry-level jobs, and provide benefits, for people who have been jobless 15 weeks or more, who have a family income at or below poverty, and who are living in a community of concentrated poverty and unemployment. The jobs would be transitional--meaning that eligible participants could stay in the program for a maximum of twelve months, although some exceptions would be allowed. 
Under the four-year STEP initiative, States and local communities would spend the first year carefully planning a job creation strategy to create, nationwide, 1.8 million jobs over three years. With an eye towards ensuring quality and the coordination of resources, the STEP Act incrementally builds the number of jobs created each year to reach the total of 1.8 million jobs. Funding is provided in the second (post-planning) year to create 200,000 jobs; in the third year to create 600,000 jobs; and in the fourth year to create 1 million jobs. 
The number one priority of STEP is creating jobs for people who need work--people living in communities of concentrated poverty and unemployment. STEP is not just a job that ends in 12 months. It is the propellant for landing sustaining employment--employment that pays a living wage, the kind of job that could provide meaningful responsibilities to help people develop work skills and get sound work experience under their belt. At the same time, STEP participants would have paid time--10 hours per week--to get secondary, vocational, or post-secondary education. Their annual earnings would be consistent with living wage principals. They would be hooked into services such as transportation and child care which will be critical to their ultimate success. Also, they would have job search and job placement assistance to help ensure their successful transition out of the STEP program. 
The second priority is to create jobs in communities where jobs are scarce--in communities of concentrated poverty--whenever possible. There is no lack of work to be done in poor neighborhoods. The STEP Act would authorize work, regardless of its location, for environmental conservation or restoration, to develop infrastructure or affordable housing, to provide human services or to support small businesses. Poor communities could use the wage subsidies that STEP would provide to help with the renovation of schools and community centers, to provide child care or community health care services, to provide elder care, to provide aides to school teachers, to provide after-school and summer recreational programs, to develop parks and playgrounds, to provide 911 phone service, to remove lead paint and asbestos, to build or renovate housing, and to provide community safety and crime prevention services. This is just some of the work that could be, and should be, done in communities with entrenched poverty. 
The jobs that would be created and the location of those jobs would be determined by the people most familiar with the needs of the community and with the needs of local residents. Local community members, elected officials, labor unions, and representatives from for-profit business would collaborate to develop work proposals and identify worksite employers. When work could be physically located in or would benefit a community of concentrated poverty and unemployment, that work would receive funding before other proposals. We would allow jobs to be located outside a community of poverty for two reasons: (1) because we understand that the best skill-developing work opportunities may lie outside the boundaries of an impoverished community and our first priority is getting people to work; and (2) because we recognize that wages alone don't renovate schools or build houses. Other resources are necessary and may not be available to those communities. Participants, however, would have to be residents of a community of concentrated poverty and unemployment. 
Employers could be local public agencies, private nonprofits, or private employers. Work created in public agencies and in nonprofits would be funded first. 
The bill contains a number of measures to ensure that current employees would not be harmed or displaced. Labor organizations would play a significant role in selecting job proposals and in monitoring work conditions. It also contains provisions to ensure that workers would be provided health insurance benefits; would be covered by Federal, State, and local labor laws; would be covered by anti-discrimination statutes; and would be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
The cost of creating 1.8 million jobs over four years as I have outlined is $21 billion. That cost of providing jobs to those who need them is a bargain compares to the inescapable price that we pay, and that our children will pay, for doing nothing. The price of neglect is high--fiscally, emotionally and culturally. 
The bill also provides funding for community development venture capital--a critical need in most low-income communities. Equity capital is in short supply in low-income areas. Grassroots community development organizations have accomplished much through self-help economic development efforts, including microlending and technical assistance to businesses. However, few of these organizations have the financial or technical capacity to make equity investments to launch businesses or to help them expand. A field of community development venture capita (CDVC)l funds is emerging to fill the gap. These CDVC funds are targeting businesses that traditional institutional investors shy away from for a variety of reasons. These are businesses that may be located in economically distressed urban or rural areas, or businesses in need of equity investment in smaller amounts than what the traditional investor would consider. Also unlike the traditional investment firm, CDVCs target companies that will create good jobs that pay decent wages and opportunities for advancement. They seek to shape the culture of young companies with respect to sustainable community development and environmental impact. That means providing entrepreneurial solutions to social problems, creating jobs and generating wealth in economically disadvantaged areas, and yielding competitive long-term investment returns. 
There are about 30 community development venture capital funds currently operating around the country. Northeast Ventures Corporation in Duluth, Minnesota is an excellent example. Northeast Ventures invests primarily in a seven county area that is a restructured mining region. They invest in a wide range of industries, with `typical' initial investments ranging from $150,000 to $350,000. 
The STEP Act would provide funding of $20 million over four years for community development venture capital initiatives. The program would help to build the capacity of existing CDVC funds and encourage the development of emerging funds. The funds would be channeled through experienced, qualified, nonprofit intermediary organizations to provide venture capital financing (loans, grants, and equity investments) to venture capital funds that serve low-income people and their communities. The funding would also be used to provide training, education and operating support to develop the technical and administrative capacity of emerging community development venture capital organizations. 
Mr. President, the STEP Act would be an important effort towards bridging America's jobs gap. I hope my colleagues will support it.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, in the spirit of debate, let me just say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I just do not think this passes the credibility test as an education program for our country.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, we are talking about a $1.7 billion initiative, and that is over a period of 5 years. The idea is that you can take $2,000 and you can put it in a special account, education account. 
Now, for those who are following this debate, I would ask this question: How many families are in a position to take $2,000 out and put it in a savings account for education? This just kind of misses the essence of the reality of the vast majority of families in this country. And that is why the Joint Tax Committee said that this $1.7 billion, over 5 years, which is touted as a major education program for our children, will amount to about $96 for wealthy parents for private schools, and this bill will give the rest of the parents about $7. 
So there is the question as to whether or not we want to take public taxpayer money and put it into private schools, but there is also the question, as my colleague from Massachusetts was focusing on, as to who exactly it is going to benefit. 
Mr. President, above and beyond the problem that the vast majority of families get no benefit from this, there is another problem. This is, again, a kind of tax policy; it is not an education program. I will get to that in a moment. And the tax benefits go, by and large, to the wealthiest citizens. I guess this is my Republican colleagues' definition of justice or fairness. But I do not think most of the people in the country agree with that. 
Where this proposal, however, I think is really most flawed has to do with what it does in education. I have tried to, to the best of my ability as a Senator from Minnesota, about every 2 weeks, to be in a school teaching somewhere. And I see nothing at all in what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle call an education proposal that deals with the real needs. 
Will there be any funding to rebuild crumbling schools? No. And, by the way, let me say this again on the floor of the Senate: I have seen too many schools in the South, in the East, in the North, and in the West, where the ceilings are crumbling, they are asbestos laden, with decrepit toilets, without adequate heating systems; and we are not putting any money to help rebuild these crumbling schools. 
I would say the pages who are here, the students--what kind of message do we communicate to students who go to those schools about whether we value them or not? There is not one penny in this legislation that does anything about these crumbling schools. That would really be a commitment to public education. 
Is there any funding in this amendment--which is, by the way, pitifully inadequate in the first place--that will do anything to reduce class size? 
Well, no. 
If you were to believe that students know a little bit about their own education--I haven't been to one school anywhere in Minnesota or in the country where when I asked students, What do you think would be some of the best things we could do to make education better for you, that students haven't talked about smaller class sizes. Is there anything in this pitifully inadequate proposal in the first place that deals with reducing class size? No. 
By the way, colleagues, I have been to too many high schools where students tell me that they are in classes with 45 students. I was in a Los Angeles meeting with some wonderful high school students. They said, `Part of the problem is we are not even missed. Nobody even knows we are there.' The school is so overcrowded, the class size is so large, how can any teacher do a good job with 45 students in a class? 
Is there anything here that reduces class size? No. Is there anything here that will help make schools safer? No. Is there anything in this legislation that will help train teachers to use new technologies? No. Is there anything in this piece of legislation that will invest in some funding for summer institutes where teachers can meet, compare notes, fire one another up, talk about new ways of teaching and learning? No. Is there anything in this education proposal, or what my colleagues call an education proposal that deals with the learning gap that tries to come to terms with students, by the time they come to kindergarten they are ready to learn; she knows how to spell her name; she knows the alphabet; he knows colors, shapes and sizes; he has been read to widely, and they have that readiness to learn? No. Is there anything in what is called this education legislation that makes a commitment to early childhood development? No. Is there anything in this legislation that helps working families--after all, as my colleague from Massachusetts said, it is their taxpayer money--is there anything in this legislation that speaks to the ordeal that so many young families go through? 
I thought we had made some progress. But we really haven't. When Sheila and I were first married, age 19 --I don't advise that, by the way, for everyone; we had our first child when we were barely 20, about a year and a half later, David. We had hardly any money. I do advise it--we have been married 35 years; it can work well. My point is--as I get myself in more trouble as I speak--we had our child David, and we hardly had any income. After, I think, six weeks, Sheila had to go back to work. 
Now we have family medical leave, but it is unpaid leave. If you don't have much money, you have to work. It was a wrenching experience, a wrenching experience to not be able to spend more time with your infant. She had to work, and I was a student and I was working. So then what happens? As it turns out, we look for what we can afford. There was a woman, a child-care giver, and she takes care of children, and we take him to her. We thought she would be good. But then after a couple of days of picking him up and he was just sort of limp, he had no expression in his face, and he had been so lively before, so we don't know what has happened. So I drop by this home in the middle of the day, and I see all these infants in playpens with pacifiers. They are not being picked up. They are not being touched. I felt so guilty I called my mom and dad and said I am going to quit school; I am going to work. I can't 
have him put in this situation. And we got some help from my parents. They were able to help us. I don't know how they did it on their income. 
Do you think that young parents who have the same experience today like the fact that they know they have no other choice but to drop their infant off in a child-care center? They know that maybe the people there aren't real well trained. People make precious little money that are involved in this area, but what choice do they have? They can't afford $12,000 a year if they have two small children. 
Is there anything in this piece of legislation or anything my Republican colleagues are doing in this session, in the Senate, that speaks to this question of how parents can do better by their children; how we can make sure that children come to kindergarten, ready to learn? That is a big education initiative. The answer is no. What do we have instead? $1.7 billion over 5 years, amounting to about $7 per family, and that is called a major education initiative? 
Is there anything in this piece of legislation that speaks to afterschool care? Let's have some sympathy with parents--single parents or both parents. Do you think parents like the fact that their 11-year-old--it is astounding, and I forget the percentage, how many 11 and 12-year-olds are home alone; it is a very high percentage. Do you think the parents like the fact they both have to work--they have no other choice--in order to have income. Some of them are working two jobs. They don't even have enough time to be with their children at home they are working so hard. 
Do you think a person likes the fact that his or her daughter age 11 or age 7, goes home alone and watches trash TV talk shows and eats junk food and there is nobody to take care of them? Do you think a parent likes the fact when we hear so many things that are not so good that happen between 3 o'clock in the afternoon and 6 p.m: do you think the parents like that? Wouldn't they like to have some really good school programs, some community programs, where their kids could be doing positive things and wouldn't be home alone, and the only reason they are home alone is because both parents have to work? No, they don't like it. So why don't we help these parents with a real education initiative. There is not a thing in this piece of legislation that deals with that at all. 
Mr. President, I have to say that this proposal, which is supposed to be the major education initiative of the Republican Party, provides help in inverse relationship to need, does zero for public education, does practically zero for working families, doesn't represent a step forward, but represents a great leap backward. The President is right to veto this piece of legislation. We must start all over again. 
I will just say to my colleagues that I think you are playing with fire. You are playing with fire with a piece of legislation that you tout as a major education reform bill that does next to nothing to make sure that we expand educational opportunity for all of our children in our country. 
I thought that children were 100 percent of our future. So I want to know, colleagues, where is our commitment to making sure that there is really good care for children before they even get to kindergarten? Where is our commitment to making sure if we are to follow the advice of all these studies that are coming out, all of this medical evidence about the development of the brain, to make sure that children have really 
good developmental child care? The answer is there is no commitment here. My colleagues in the majority of the Republican Party have no initiative at all. 
Where is the commitment to rebuild the crumbling schools and to have the teacher training and to have smaller class size and to make sure that the Internet and all this new technology means that all the schools are wired and teachers know how to work with it and children and young people become literate in this area? The answer is there is no commitment whatsoever. 
Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak against this piece of legislation. I hope my colleagues will vote against it. I hope the President will veto it. Then we must come back to education again. 
Colleagues, it is not enough to be giving speeches about this. I apply that to myself, as well. It is not enough to have photo opportunities with small children. We all love to have our pictures taken with children. It is not enough to be in the schools once in a while. And it is not enough to say that young people are our future. If we don't make the commitment, backed by solid legislation, with resources to get to communities so we can do well for all the children in our country, then from my point of view, we will not have been honest. 
We will not have done all that we should do. By the way, when I say `honest,' I don't mean as in personally honest. Senator Coverdell, the author of this bill, is a friend and I respect him. But I think in terms of the effect of this, it doesn't honestly reach children in our country; it doesn't honestly contribute to public education; it doesn't honestly contribute to the education of the vast majority of young people in the United States of America. Therefore, colleagues ought to vote against it. 
Mr. President, how much time do we have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has been--I am trying to remember now--almost a year since James Hormel was voted out of Foreign Relations Committee by a 16-2 vote. I have said this a number of times on the floor of the Senate, and I want to keep saying it. 
James Hormel, I think, is eminently qualified to be Ambassador to Luxembourg. He has a very, very, very distinguished record as an educator, as a businessman, as a philanthropist, and as somebody who has given to many, many communities in our country. I see no reason whatsoever why we do not have an up-or-down vote on this on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I have said it to colleagues directly. I don't say it indirectly. I want to make terribly sure that the reason Mr. James Hormel's nomination has not been brought to the floor is not because of discrimination against him because of his sexual orientation. I hope that is not the case, but I do believe that we need to have an honest discussion about this nomination. We need to have a full-scale debate, and we need to have an up-or-down vote. 
I think we should judge people by the content of their character. I think we should judge people by their vision and by their leadership ability. It is my fervent hope that the majority leader will bring this nomination to the floor. I have said that I am looking for a vehicle--we have things kind of snarled up here right now--on which to bring an amendment out that in one way or another will put an even sharper focus on this question. 
I do intend to speak out and I intend to use whatever leverage I have as a Senator to continue to push on this question. If Senators have reasons for objecting to Mr. Hormel's nomination, let them come out here and speak. Let us have an honest debate. If, God forbid, there are objections to him based upon his sexual orientation, then I think the U.S. Senate needs to look at itself in the mirror, because I think we can do better than that. 
I yield the floor and reserve the balance of our time. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the excellent work of two musicians from Minnesota. On June 4, Heather MacLaughlin and Alan Johnston performed at the Kennedy Center. These two are not only excellent musicians, but they are teachers and leaders as well. 
Ms. MacLaughlin is one of the Twin Cities' leading collaborative pianists. She has performed with the Minnesota Orchestra and St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and her performances have been aired on both Minnesota and National Public Radio. She is a recipient of the prestigious McKnight Artist Fellowship award with violinist Leslie Shank. This award will allow the two performers to record the Bartok Sonatas for violin and piano and showcase their talents to a national audience. 
Mr. Johnston is the founder of the Minneapolis Guitar Quartet (MGC) which is nationally recognized for its excellence. The MGC has performed throughout the United States and on the nationally syndicated radio program St. Paul Sunday Morning. In addition, they have also represented the United States abroad, performing in South America and Spain. 
On June 4, these two outstanding performers were invited to showcase their talents here in our nation's capital at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Through this performance the people of Washington benefitted from the talent that we in Minnesota have already been exposed to. 
MacLaughlin and Johnston carry on the tradition of great performers who share their knowledge with others so that they, too, may realize their potential. Both are teachers at the MacPhail Center for the Arts in Minneapolis. The MacPhail Center was founded by Minneapolis Symphony member William S. MacPhail in 1907. It has grown out of its humble beginnings of four teachers and 82 students into the second largest community music school in the country. Its 125 instructors teach in over 40 instrument areas, and the school has exceptional programs in Early Childhood Arts and in Suzuki Talent Education. 
We in Minnesota are proud of our strong arts community and of the tradition that the Twin Cities area is developing as a center for artistic and cultural expression. The MacPhail Center has made an enormous contribution to the study and enjoyment of music in our community. I am pleased to congratulate the MacPhail Center as well as Heather MacLaughlin and Alan Johnston.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the majority leader, when asked whether or not homosexuality is a sin, stated, `Yes, it is.' He added that `in America right now there's an element that wants to make that alternative lifestyle acceptable.' Then he went on to say, `Others have a sex addiction or are kleptomaniacs. There are all kinds of problems and addictions and difficulties and experiences of this kind that are wrong. But you should try to work with that person to learn to control that problem.' 
He also said--to be fair to the majority leader--`You still love that person and you should not try to mistreat them or treat them as outcasts. You should try to show them a way to deal with that.' That was the beginning of the quote. I do not want to take anything out of context. 
Mr. President, I am concerned about calling homosexuality a sin, comparing it to the problems of alcoholism or other diseases. I am concerned because of the medical evidence. I am concerned because I think that in many ways this statement takes us back quite a ways from where we are. 
We do not bash each other here; and there is civility here. That is what I like best. So let me just simply say, the majority leader is entitled to his view and he is entitled to his vote. But I am concerned. I have been on the floor of the Senate week after week talking about the nomination of James Hormel. I really believe that, given this statement by the majority leader, and given other statements that have been made, the U.S. Senate would be better off if we bring this nomination to the floor. 
It was literally back in November of last year, November 4, 1997, that Mr. Hormel was voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by a 16-2 vote. There have been holds on the nomination. We ought to bring it to the floor so that we can have an honest discussion. The majority leader is entitled to his opinion and he is entitled to his vote, but the rest of us are also entitled to our opinions and we are entitled to our votes. 
I think it is extremely important that this nomination be brought to the floor; that we have an honest discussion. No acrimony whatsoever, but please let us deal with this issue, and let us give Mr. Hormel the fairness that he deserves. I will not talk more about him right now. I will not talk about his very distinguished career. But I must say, given the majority leader's statements, it makes me stronger in my belief that we need to bring this nomination to the floor, and we need to have a discussion about this question. 
It will be a civil discussion. It will be an honest discussion. I think the vast majority of Senators are ready to vote for Mr. Hormel. I will have an amendment that I will put on a bill that will deal with this question, probably the first bill after the tobacco bill. But where I want to get to is to bring this nomination to the floor. Otherwise I worry about a climate that is going to become increasingly polarized, increasingly poisonous, and we do not want that to happen. We do not want that to happen. 
So I am hopeful that the U.S. Senate, in a spirit of civility and honesty with one another, and honesty with Mr. James Hormel, will bring this to the floor. 
I thank my colleagues for letting me also mention this matter. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last night, I spoke about the Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact bill, H.R. 629, that is now going to conference committee. It has to do with low-level radioactive waste being dumped in the community of Sierra Blanca, TX. It is a compact between Maine and Vermont that affects the people of Sierra Blanca. 
Last night, we sent instructions to conferees to insist on two amendments that had been agreed upon by the Senate. One amendment says that if the people of Sierra Blanca, disproportionately poor and Latino, are able to prove disparate impact--that they are disproportionately affected, that they have been targeted because of low income, because they are a poor community, because of the color of their skin--then they have every right to challenge the dump. I don't know why we don't at least give people that chance. That amendment has now been approved by the Senate. It is terribly important, because all too often when it comes to the location of these sites, we dump them--no pun intended--right on the heads of poor people and communities of color. 
The second amendment--and I had a chance to speak about this last night--I call a protection clause. It is very similar to the amendment offered by Congressman Doggett which passed in the House. Basically, it says that if the compact waste is only supposed to come from Maine and Vermont, then let's affirm this with an amendment which makes it clear that the waste will only come from Maine and Vermont. Otherwise, there is a very good chance that the people of Hudspeth County and Sierra Blanca will become a national depository for nuclear waste from all over the country. That is the last thing I think the people in Texas want. That is certainly the last thing that the people in the community of Sierra Blanca want. 
The reason I mention both of these amendments is that we now have instructions to our conferees to insist on these amendments in conference committee. This is a battle that has been going on for over a year in the Senate. I raised questions about this starting a year ago. What I said was that, as a Senator from Minnesota, I am concerned about this issue of environmental injustice and, if we have to approve this compact, let us make sure there is some fairness to this and some justice to it. 
My colleagues in the Senate have gone on record in favor of both of these amendments. The House of Representatives has gone on record as being in favor of the Doggett amendment, which is also a Wellstone amendment, that says, indeed, the waste will only come from Maine and Vermont. 
As we go to conference, I want to emphasize one point to my colleagues, and that is, don't strip these amendments from this bill in conference committee. That is what the nuclear utilities would like conferees to do, but it will make a mockery of the House and Senate. It will, in fact, give people not only in Texas but from around the country reason to think this is another example of a back-room deal, another example of the legislative process at its worst, another example of big utility companies riding roughshod over poor communities and, for that matter, regular citizens in this country. 
I want to make it clear to colleagues that it is extremely important that the conferees live up to our instructions and that these amendments become part of this bill. If they do not, it will be a striking example of unequal access to political power, which is, I think, the reason we have too much environmental discrimination all across the country in the first place. 
I make this plea to my colleagues, to the conferees: We have voted to keep these amendments in this bill. The Senate is on record unanimously as saying that these amendments should be part of this compact and therefore it is extremely important that these amendments not be stripped out. The issue of environmental justice deserves better than that, the people of Sierra Blanca deserve better than that, and people in our country have a right to expect a higher standard of conduct from their elected representatives than to try to knock this out in the dark of night. 
I say to colleagues, I have tried to work with my colleagues, even those who are in disagreement with me. But if these amendments are taken out of the conference committee--and I hope that they will not be, I pray that they will not be--but if they are, I will take advantage of every procedural means at my disposal to make sure that this does not happen, and to make sure that there is some environmental justice when it comes to this compact which all of us are going to have to vote on as Members of the U.S. Senate. 
I thank my colleague from Washington for letting me have an opportunity to speak from the floor to give colleagues a sense of where we are on this compact. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota has spoken to the arbitration provision in the legislation. I shall not do so. I just want to present a Minnesota perspective for just a moment. 
I come from a State where we just went through a very important trial. The lawyers in my State, working with the attorney general, were able to unearth 33 million pages of documents--33 million pages of documents. This was during a discovery process that went from August 1994 to the end of 1997. Many of those documents have had an enormous impact, not just on the settlement in Minnesota, which was a very important settlement, but also directly on the debate in the U.S. Congress. Thirty-nine thousand pages of those documents were ordered produced by the Minnesota judge and were ultimately subpoenaed by the House of Representatives and made public on the Internet. 
What I want to do is speak to the part of this amendment that concerns me the most. I have had some discussion with my colleague from Alabama, and I have said to him, `Why don't you, in fact, not make this retroactive,' when he had his similar amendments on the floor, because I don't think we should be taking action here that reaches back to the Minnesota settlement, which has already been entered into and has been declared final by the court. We already have an arrangement between the State and the Attorney General and the lawyers who represented our State. Congress should not disturb that. 
I think the amendment of my colleague from the State of Washington has a different weakness and that is its lack of evenhandedness. What I want to see at a bare minimum is to have the same kind of caps or limits put on those attorneys representing the tobacco companies. I say to colleagues, when you vote on this amendment, the thing you ought to fasten your attention on is that we don't have the same kind of ceiling, the same kind of caps put on fees that go to lawyers representing the tobacco companies. 
I see nothing here that does that, in which case I would argue that we are hardly talking about a level playing field. 
I think the problem with the amendment is that it just simply lacks balance. I cannot support an amendment that puts caps on the fees of plaintiffs' attorneys representing consumers and representing the attorney general from a State, but at the same time puts no cap at all on the fees of attorneys hired by tobacco companies or other big corporations with their corporate lawyers working with these companies, but there is no cap on the fees. That just simply makes no sense to me from a kind of elementary standard of fairness, and that is why I think the amendment is fatally flawed.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to speak out this evening about an enormously important issue that has seldom, if ever, been addressed on the floor of the United States Senate. I understand my colleague needs to leave at 7, and I am going to try to figure out a way to accommodate him if at all possible. My understanding is, I will also have a chance to speak more about this in morning business. 
This issue I want to address tonight has variously been called `environmental discrimination,' `environmental equity,' `environmental justice,' or `environmental racism.' These terms are used interchangeably to describe the well-documented tendency for pollution and waste dumps to be sited in poor and minority communities who lack the political power to keep them out. 
Environmental justice has been at the center of the debate over H.R. 629, legislation granting congressional consent to the so-called Texas Compact. If passed unamended by this Congress, the Texas Compact would result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste from nuclear reactors in Texas, Maine, and Vermont--and potentially from nuclear reactors all over the country--in the poor and majority-Latino town of Sierra Blanca in West Texas. 
Environmental justice is an issue that demands the full attention of the Senate. If we pass this legislation unamended, we can no loner pretend to be innocent bystanders as one poor, minority community after another is victimized by political powerlessness--and, in some cases, by overt racism. We can no longer pretend that a remedy for this basic violation of civil rights is beyond our reach. That is the ultimate significance of this legislation--and of this debate. 
The moral responsibility of the Senate is unavoidable and undeniable. If we approve H.R. 629 without conditions, the Compact dump will be built within a few miles of Sierra Blanca. There's really very little doubt about that. And if that happens, this poor Hispanic community could become the premier national repository for so-called `low-level' radioactive waste. 
If we reject this Compact, on the other hand, the Sierra Blanca dump will not be built at all. The Texas Governor has said so publicly--more than once. It's as simple as that. The fate of Sierra Blanca rests in our hands. 
Compact supporters would prefer that we consider the Compact without any reference to the actual location of the dump. But that simply cannot be done. It's true that H.R. 629 says nothing about Sierra Blanca. But we know very well where this waste will be dumped. In that respect, the Texas Compact is different from other compacts the Senate has considered. 
The Texas legislature in 1991 already identified the area where the dump will be located. The Texas Waste Authority designated the site near Sierra Blanca in 1992. A draft license was issued in 1996. License proceedings are now in their final stages and should be completed by summer. Nobody doubts that the Texas authorities will soon issue that license. 
There's only one reason why this dump might not get built--and that's if Congress rejects the Texas Compact. In an April 1998 interview, Texas Gov. George Bush said, `If that does not happen,' meaning congressional passage of the Compact, `then all bets are off.' In the El Paso Times of May 28, Gov. Bush said, `If there's not a Compact in place, we will not move forward.' 
For these reasons, we cannot fairly consider H.R. 629 without also considering the dump site that Texas has selected. Sierra Blanca is a small town in one of poorest parts of Texas, an area with one of the highest percentages of Latino residents. The average income of people who live there is less than $8,000. Thirty-nine percent live below the poverty line. Over 66 percent are Latino, and many of them speak only Spanish. 
It is a town that has already been saddled with one of the largest sewage sludge projects in the world. Every week Sierra Blanca receives 250 tons of partially treated sewage sludge from across the country. Depending on what action Congress decides to take, this small town with minimal political clout may also become the national repository for low-level radioactive waste. And I understand plans for building even more dump sites are also in the works. 
Supporters of the Compact would have us believe that the designation of Sierra Blanca had nothing to do with the income or ethnic characteristics of its residents. That it had nothing to do with the high percentage of Latinos in Sierra Blanca and the surrounding Hudspeth County--at least 2.6 times higher than the State average. That the percentage of people living in poverty--at least 2.1 times higher than the State average--was completely irrelevant. 
They would have us believe that Sierra Blanca was simply the unfortunate finalist in a rigorous and deliberate screening process that fairly considered potential sites from all over the State. That the outcome was based on science and objective criteria. I don't believe any of this is true. 
I am not saying science played no role whatsoever in the process. It did. Indeed, based on the initial criteria coupled with the scientific findings, Sierra Blanca was disqualified as a potential dump site. It wasn't until politics entered the picture that Sierra Blanca was even considered. 
I think it is worth taking a moment to review how we got to where we are today. The selection criteria for the dump were established in 1981, and the Texas Waste Authority hired engineering consultants to screen the entire state for suitable sites. 
In March 1985, consultants Dames & Moore delivered their report to the Authority. Using `exclusionary' criteria established by the Authority, Dames & Moore ruled out Sierra Blanca and the surrounding area, due primarily to its complex geology. 
Let me quote from that report. Features `applied as exclusionary as related to the Authority's Siting Criteria' included `the clearly exclusionary features of: complex geology; tectonic fault zones,' et cetera. `The application of exclusionary geological criteria has had a substantial impact' in screening potential sites, the report observed. 
In its final composite, the report explained, `Complex geology and mountainous areas in West, West-Central, and the Panhandle of Texas were excluded,' including the Sierra Blanca dump site. 
The report also fund, `Many tectonic faults occur in West Texas within massive blocks of mountain ranges. This area includes El Paso [and] Hudspeth' counties `and has undergone several phases or episodes of tectonic disturbance.' 
Finally, it went on to observe that, `Although not excluded, the remainder of Hudspeth Country does not appear to offer good siting potential.' 
So much for the science. Repeatedly since the early 1980s, the Waste Authority has come back again and again to this politically powerless area. It has designated four potential sites in all, and--with one revealing exception--all of them were in Hudspeth County. There are only three communities in the entire County, all of them poor and heavily Latino, and all of them targeted by the Authority. 
A 1984 public opinion survey commissioned by the Texas Waste Authority provides some useful context for the Authority's site selection process. The report, called `An Analysis of Public Opinion on Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal in Selected Areas,' noted the benefits of keeping Latinos uninformed. 
The report states, `One population that may benefit from [a public information] campaign is Hispanics, particularly those with little formal education and low-incomes. The Authority should be aware, however, that increasing the level of knowledge of Hispanics may simply increase opposition to the [radioactive dump] site, inasmuch as we have discovered a strong relationship in the total sample between increased perceived knowledge and increased opposition.' 
The first site to be targeted was Dell City in Hudspeth County. The El Paso Herald-Post of March 6, 1984 recounts the controversy over that site selection. `The [Texas Waste] Authority has set up certain criteria as guidelines for choosing a disposal site. It appears to be ignoring its own rules.' `The Authority, instead of abiding by its written criteria, has set up an unspoken, alternate rule for locating the site. That is, `The site shall be located where there are the fewest possible number of registered voters to protest.' A disproportionately high number of Latinos in Hudspeth County are not registered to vote. 
The Herald-Post goes on to describe some of the political maneuvering behind the initial selection of Hudspeth County. `The plot thickens. The University of Texas system owns 500,000 acres of land around Dell City. Mrs. Dolph Briscoe, wife of the former governor, sits on the system's Board of Regents. Briscoe has extensive land holdings close to the other proposed site. So at a public meeting on October 25, 1983, in Dimmit County, Briscoe said he was encouraging the Authority to locate the site `on state lands in Hudspeth County.' The editorialists at the Herald-Post conclude, `We haven't exactly got any heavyweights defending our interests in this matter.' 
The one exception to the Authority's pattern of targeting the poor Latino communities in Hudspeth 
County was in 1985, after completion of the engineering consultants' report. Dames & Moore concluded that the `best' sites were in McMullen and Dimmit Counties, and the Waste Authority settled on a site in McMullen County. But this decision met with fierce opposition from politically powerful individuals. So the Authority decided once again to move the dump back to Hudspeth County. 
At this point all pretense of objectivity was abandoned. The selection criteria were changed in 1985 so as to rule out the two `best' sites identified by Dames & Moore. The new criteria gave preference to sites located on state-owned land. This change had the effect of virtually guaranteeing selection of a site somewhere in Hudspeth County, large portions of which are owned by the state of Texas. 
So the Waste Authority proceeded to designate, based on an informal and cursory process, five sites in Hudspeth County. Its clear choice, however, was Fort Hancock, one of the County's three poor Latino communities. 
Unfortunately for the Authority, the more politically powerful city of El Paso next door decided to fight back. Together with Hudspeth County, El Paso filed suit against the site selection. They argued that the Hancock site was located in an area of complex geology--much like Sierra Blanca, incidentally--and lay on a 100-year flood plain. The amazing thing is that they won. In 1991 U.S. District Court Judge Moody ruled in their favor and ordered no dump could be built in Fort Hancock, Hudspeth County. 
But the county's court victory was short-lived. The Waste Authority was clearly not about to give up. The Authority went back to the state legislature to get around Judge Moody's decision by once again changing the rules. A legislator from Houston, far to the East where the big utilities are based, proposed a bill that ignored all previous selection criteria and designated Fort Hancock once and for all. Interestingly enough, this maneuver aroused a great deal of public indignation, precisely because of the Authority's perceived discriminatory practice of dumping on Latino communities. 
There was an impressive show of force against discrimination, but the outcome was not exactly what Hudspeth County had in mind. After Judge Moody's remarkable decision, lawyers for El Paso and the Waste Authority worked out a compromise. Fort Hancock would be saved, but a 400 square mile area further north in Hudspeth County would take its place. This oblong rectangle imposed on the map--an area that included Sierra Blanca--was subsequently dubbed `The Box.' The Texas legislature passed the so-called `Box Law' by voice vote only days before the end of session in May 1991. 
Once again, the previous site selection procedures were stripped away. The Box Law repealed the requirement that the dump had to be on public land, the very requirement that has pointed the Authority towards Hudspeth County in the first place. This was necessary because, at that time, the Sierra Blanca site was not public land at all. 
Most importantly, to prevent another troublesome lawsuit like the Fort Hancock debacle, the Box Law essentially stripped local citizens of the right to sue. It denied them all judicial relief other than an injunction by the Texas Supreme Court itself, and for this unlikely prospect citizens would be required to drive 500 miles to Austin. 
This story is depressingly familiar. A similar scenario unfolds over and over again in different parts of the country, with different names and faces in every situation. Sometimes there is no intention by anyone to discriminate. But pervasive inequalities of race, income, and access to the levers of political power exercise a controlling influence over the siting of undesirable waste dumps. 
The people who make these decisions sometimes are only following the path of least resistance, but in far too many instances the result is a targeting of poor, politically marginalized minority communities who lack the political muscle to do anything about it. 
The remarkable thing about this story is that some people in Hudspeth County did fight back. Dell City fought back and won in the early 1980s. Fort Hancock fought back and won their court case in 1991. And make no mistake, the people of Sierra Blanca are fighting back, too. 
Many of them have been here on the Hill. Father Ralph Solis, the parish priest for Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County, was here in February, and visited many Senate offices. These people know that the odds are stacked against them, but they are persevering just the same. 
One of the amendments I included in this bill is intended to give them a fighting chance. It gives them their day in court--the right to challenge this site selection on grounds of environmental justice. It says that the Compact cannot be implemented in any way--and that would include the siting process, the licensing process, or the shipment of waste to that site--that discriminates against communities because of their race, national origin, or income level. 
If local residents can prove discrimination in court, then they can stop the Compact Commission from operating the dump. They don't have to prove intent, by the way, although that certainly would be sufficient. All they have to show is disparate treatment or disparate impact. 
I believe very strongly that the Compact raises important and troubling issues of `environmental justice.' And a diverse array of civic organizations agree with me about this.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues don't believe issues of environmental justice are implicated here. Or they may think this is not a question for the Senate to decide. I believe this amendment meets those concerns. All my amendment does is give local residents the right to make their case in court. There is no guarantee they will win. After all, it is extremely difficult to prove environmental discrimination. I don't see how anyone would want to deny these people a chance to make their case. 
Short of defeating the bill outright, I believe passing this amendment is the only way for us to do right by the people of Sierra Blanca. 
Yet, as amazing as it sounds, Compact proponents also claim to have the best interests of Sierra Blanca at heart. They claim the Compact will protect local residents because it keeps out waste from states other than Maine and Vermont. They have used this argument again and again, in Sierra Blanca, in the Texas legislature, in the House of Representatives, and they're using it again in the United States Senate. 
Supporters of the Compact are trying to have it both ways. When challenged about the environmental justice of targeting Sierra Blanca, they respond that no site has been selected, and environmental justice can only be addressed if and when that ever happens. 
Then in the same breath they insist that the dump in Sierra Blanca is definitely going forward and the Compact is therefore necessary to protect local residents from outside waste. So which is it? Either the Sierra Blanca dump is a done deal or it's not. 
The truth is, the most likely scenario is that the dump will be built in Sierra Blanca if Congress approves this Compact, subject to any legal challenges, but the project will not go forward if Congress rejects the Compact. 
The claim that the Compact will protect Sierra Blanca makes no sense on its face. The dump is unlikely to be built without congressional consent to this Compact; it does not need to be built; and the Compact would not protect Sierra Blanca in any event. 
The simple fact of the matter is that the dump will most likely not be if the Compact fails. Governor Bush has made it very clear that the dump will not be built if Congress rejects the Compact. So the argument that Sierra Blanca needs the Compact for protection against outside waste is nonsensical. If Texas does not build a dump in Sierra Blanca, local citizens do not need to be protected from anything. Far from protecting Sierra Blanca, the Compact only ensures that a dump will be built in their community. 
An article from the Texas Observer of last March explains why the Compact is necessary for the dump to go forward. `Texas generates nowhere near enough waste on its own to fill a three million cubic feet dump, and by its own projections [the Texas Waste Authority] could not survive without Maine and Vermont's waste.' 
Moreover, the Texas legislature has indicated it will not appropriate funding to build the 
dump if Congress rejects this Compact. Texas lawmakers refused the Waste Authority's request for $37 million for construction money in FY 1998 and FY 1999. In fact, the Texas House initially zeroed out all funding for the Authority, but funding for licensing was later restored in conference committee. My understanding is that construction funding was made contingent on passage of the Compact, whereupon Maine and Vermont will each be required to pay Texas over $25 million. 
In fact, the Sierra Blanca dump does not really need to be built. You might have seen the headline in the New York Times on December 7 of last year: `Warning of Excess Capacity in Nation's Nuclear Dumps--New Technology and Recycling Sharply Reduce the Volume of Nuclear Waste.' 
The article discusses a study by Dr. Gregory Hayden, the Nebraska Commissioner for the Central Interstate Compact Commission. Dr. Hayden found that `there is currently an excess capacity for low-level radioactive waste disposal in the United States without any change to current law or practice.' 
He went on to explain, `These disposal sites have had low utilization due to falling volumes since 1980. Thus, a high capacity remains for the future, without any change to the current configuration of which states may ship to which disposal site.' Let me repeat the essential point: there is no compelling need for any new low-level radioactive waste dumps in this country. And if no new dump is built, nobody can argue that the Compact is needed to protect Sierra Blanca. 
The most popular argument for building another dump involves disposal of medical waste. I'm sure all of you have heard it. It's claimed that waste from medical facilities and research labs is getting backed up--that it has to go somewhere. 
But let me emphasize one central and indisputable fact: over the last few years, over 99 percent of the waste from Maine and Vermont has come from nuclear reactors. Less than one percent has been from hospitals and universities. And from all three states, 94 percent of the low-level waste between 1991 and 1994 came from reactors. This dump is being built--first and foremost--to dispose of radioactive waste from nuclear reactors, not from hospitals. 
So why are the nuclear utilities hiding behind hospitals and universities? It's not very hard to figure out. In 1984 the Texas Waste Authority hired a public relations firm to increase the popularity of nuclear waste. The PR firm recommended, `A more positive view of safe disposal technologies should be engendered by the use of medical doctors and university faculty scientists as public spokesmen for the [Texas Waste] Authority.' `Whenever possible,' the report said, `the Authority should speak through these parties.' 
Well, that advice has been followed to the letter. We all have sympathies for hospital work and university research. I know I do. But that's beside the point. This controversy is really about waste from nuclear reactors. 
If a dump is built nevertheless, the Compact offers little protection for local residents. The Compact Commission would be able to accept low-level radioactive waste from any person, state, regional body, or group of states. All it would take is a majority vote of the Commissioners, who are appointed by the Compact state governors. 
Why should the people of Sierra Blanca expect unelected commissioners to keep waste out of their community? Is there anything in their recent experience that would justify such faith? 
The fact is, the state will have every economic incentive to bring in more waste. The November 1997 report by Dr. Hayden concluded that `the small volume of waste available for any new site would not allow the facility to take advantage of economies of scale. Thus, it would not even be able to operate at the low-cost portion of its own cost functions.' 
The new dump will need high volume to stay profitable. The Texas Observer reports, `A 1994 analysis by the Houston Business Journal suggests that the Authority would open the facility to other states to keep it viable.' 
We have here the potential for establishing a new national repository for low-level nuclear waste. Not only will Texas have an incentive to bring in as much waste as possible, but the same will be true of nuclear utilities. The more waste goes to Sierra Blanca, the less they will be charged for disposal. 
Rick Jacobi, General Manager of the Texas Waste Authority, told the Houston Business Journal: `The site is designed for 100,000 cubic feet per year, which would be about $160 per cubic foot. But if only 60,000 cubic feet per year of waste arrives, the price would be $250 per cubic foot.' That's a big difference. 
As Molly Ivins says, `That sure would drive up costs for Houston Lighting and Power and Texas Utilities.' And the going rate at one existing dump is a whopping $450 per cubic foot. In the end, it will be in the economic interest of everyone--from the nuclear utilities to the Waste Authority--to ship as much waste to Sierra Blanca as they can. 
My second amendment addresses this problem. Throughout the process of approving the Compact, supporters claimed the waste would be limited to three states. I want to hold them to that promise. My amendment puts that promise in writing. 
I doubt anyone would disagree that this understanding was shared by everyone who participated in the Compact debate. If Compact supporters truly plan to limit waste to three states, which has been everyone's understanding all along, they can have no objection to my amendment. It's nothing but a protection clause. A nearly identical amendment--called the Doggett Amendment--was attached to the bill passed by the House. 
There are other issues I was not able to address with amendments. I think there is a fundamental concern about whether this kind of disposal is safe at all. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) warns that, despite the hazards involved, waste will be buried in soil 
trenches destined to leak, as have nuclear dumps in Kentucky, Illinois; and Nevada. LCV did score the House vote on final passage, and has announced that it may score Senate votes as well. I ask unanimous consent to place the LCV letter in the Record.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is also an obvious concern about the unsuitability of Sierra Blanca's geology--the exclusionary criterion from the 1985 Dames & Moore report. Sierra Blanca is situated right in the middle of the state's only earthquake zone. Its 1993 license application stated that this is `the most tectonically active area within the state of Texas.' In April 1995 there was a 5.6 earthquake 100 miles away, in Alpine, Texas. And there have been two tremors in the area in the last four years. 
Radioactive Waste Management Associates (RWMA) of New York has conducted an independent investigation of the dump site and found its geology unsuitable for disposal of radioactive waste. RWMA notes that research by the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority has found that [there is] a fault in the bedrock buried beneath the Sierra Blanca site. Groups of earth fissures up to seven feet deep occur nearby. 
RWMA concludes that some important natural features of the site--its seismic hazard, its buried fault, and nearby earth fissures--are not suited to radioactive waste isolation. In our professional opinion, these are fatal flaws which mean that the proposed Sierra Blanca site cannot provide a high degree of assurance of waste containment. 
I ask unanimous consent to enter the letter from RWMA into the Record. 
The concern about the environmental impact of this dump extends well beyond the border. The Mexican equivalent of the EPA announced its opposition on March 5 on grounds that the Sierra Blanca dump poses an environmental risk to the border region. On February 11, the Mexican Congress, represented by its Permanent Commission, declared that the project in Sierra Blanca in Texas, and all such dumping projects along the border with Mexico, constitute an aggression against national dignity. 
Moreover, the project apparently violates the 1983 La Paz Agreement between Mexico and the US, which commits both countries to prevent pollution affecting the border area. I ask unanimous consent to enter these statements by Mexican authorities into the Record. 
The environmental justice amendments I proposed have been endorsed by several newspapers and civic organizations. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram of May 1, 1998 reads, 
The amendment to the Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact by Minnesotan Sen. Paul Wellstone is a good one. Too often in our country's industrialized history, poor, politically powerless minority communities have been targeted for unwanted hazardous waste dumps. . . . The Wellstone amendment needs to stay in the final version of the bill. 
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights wrote to likely conferees on May 14, 1998, 
The Senate-passed bill contains two amendments sponsored by Sen. Paul Wellstone that we urge the conferees to include in any final conference report. 
The Leadership Conference states 
that a matter of increasing concern to the civil rights community [is] the disparate treatment of poor and minority communities regarding environmental siting issues, also known as environmental justice. 
In recent years, our nation has gained a better understanding of the national pattern of discrimination in the placement of waste and pollution sites in disproportionately poor and minority communities. 
By the end of their letter, the Leadership Conference `strongly urge the inclusion of the Wellstone/Doggett amendments in any final bill approved by Congress.' 
The Methodist Church's General Board of Church and Society wrote on April 30, 1998, `We applaud and support these [Wellstone] amendments. They are a small victory for the victims of environmental racism.' 
The Sierra Club wrote on June 4, 1998, `Sen. Paul Wellstone has introduced two amendments that would improve the bill,' though the Sierra Club believes the bill remains deeply flawed. I ask unanimous consent that all these statements be placed in the Record. 
Not everyone has been so supportive, of course. I think it would be appropriate for me to respond to some of the arguments that have been raised against my amendments. 
First, it's been suggested that passage of my amendments would require states to reratify the Compact. Second, a recurring theme echoed by Compact supporters is that Congress has never before attached these kinds of conditions to a state compact. Third, Senators from Compact states have suggested that no environmental discrimination could possibly have occurred in this case because residents of Sierra Blanca actually support the dump. Finally, it has also been claimed that the Compact is a state or local matter, in which people from other states have no business interfering. 
As a preliminary matter, I question the relevance of these arguments--at least with respect to the Wellstone/Doggett amendment. This question has already been settled. Both the House and Senate have agreed to limit waste to the three Compact states. There really is very little for the conference committee to decide. I do not understand why we are even having this discussion at this stage in the process. 
Nevertheless, I do want to respond to some of these arguments individually. First: the reratification argument. I believe there may be some confusion as to what my amendments actually do. As the House parliamentarian found with respect to the Doggett amendment, these amendments do not actually alter the Compact itself. Instead, they impose conditions on the consent of Congress. 
The Compact, for constitutional reasons, cannot go into effect without that consent. And Congress has already conditioned its consent on certain other requirements. My two amendments simply add to that list of congressional conditions. 
With regard to the Wellstone/Doggett limitation, there's no reason why this amendment 
should require reratification. When the Compact made its way through the legislative process the first time, everybody understood that waste would be limited to the three states. My amendment only reaffirms the common understanding of everyone involved. Why should states be required to reaffirm a principle to which they have already given their consent? 
I'm not sure this conclusion is really so controversial--even within the Compact states themselves. I have in my hands an internal memorandum from Roger Mulder of the State Energy Conservation Office of the Texas General Services Commission. Mr. Mulder was an environmental aide to Gov. Richards and handled Compact issues in the Richards Administration. His memo is addressed to John Howard, an environmental adviser to Governor Bush. It is dated October 10, 1997, just days after passage of the Doggett amendment in the House. 
The first line of the memo reads, `There appears to be a unanimous agreement that the Doggett amendment does not require the Texas Compact to be returned to the state legislatures.' `Unanimous agreement.' That's not just the view of Mr. Mulder. According to his memo, that view is universally held. 
The Mulder memo goes on to note that `Maine appears to be leading the charge in the effort to drop the Doggett amendment.' The reason? `There is speculation that Maine believes it can send its decommissioned waste to Barnwell, South Carolina,' get credit for the waste it otherwise would have sent to Texas, and `then sell that credit at a substantial profit for Maine.' That's what Mr. Mulder's memo says, at least. 
Nevertheless, I have been willing--and remain willing--to allay any legitimate concerns Compact supporters may have about the need for reratification. I offered to instruct conferees to put Congress on record--in the statement of managers--that no reratification is required. My offer was rejected. 
The second argument advanced by Compact supporters is that no previous Compact has received such shabby treatment at the hands of Congress. Even if Congress had never before attached these kinds of conditions, that would say nothing about how Congress should treat THIS Compact. Why should we be bound by what prior Congresses have done? 
And besides, this Compact is different from previous ones. We know in advance where the Texas dump will be located. And this particular site selection raises important questions of environmental justice. 
Third, Compact supporters go so far as to claim that local residents actually support the Compact, and therefore no discrimination could have been involved in the site selection. Even if it were true that the dump enjoyed local support, I don't see what this has to do with site selection. 
But more importantly, my argument that local residents should have a chance to challenge the dump site does not depend--one way or the other--on whether the proposed 
Compact dump is popular in Hudspeth County. I am simply saying that there should be some forum to resolve the claims of environmental discrimination that have been raised. I cannot say for certain what the outcome of such a challenge would be. But local residents should at least have a chance to make their case. 
In any event, the argument that local residents support the dump is simply not true. I am surprised to hear it being made. Local congressmen of both parties seem to agree on this point. The Republican congressman who represents Hudspeth County, Henry Bonilla, wrote to the Senate on March 13, 1998: `My constituents adamantly oppose this legislation.' 
In a letter to senators dated February 2, Democratic Congressmen Doggett, Reyes, and Rodriguez wrote,  
The [House] bill passed despite overwhelming opposition by the residents in Hudspeth County, Presidio County, Jeff Davis County, Culberson County, Val Verde County, Reeves County, Webb County, Brewster County, the cities of Sierra Blanca, Del Rio, Brackettville, Marfa, Van Horn, and Alpine, and the governor of the neighboring state of Chihuahua. 
In fact, 22 of the surrounding counties have passed resolutions opposing the dump, as have 11 nearby cities. No city or county, to my knowledge, has passed a resolution in favor. 
Jeff Davis County did pass a resolution of support while under the impression that the Compact would keep waste out of Texas. When informed that the Compact would do no such thing, they reversed their vote almost immediately. Compact lobbyists nevertheless continue to cite the first resolution. 
The only poll ever taken in Hudspeth County showed massive opposition to the dump. In 1992 the Texas Waste Authority commissioned K Associates of El Paso to conduct a telephone poll. That poll found 64 percent of Hudspeth and Culberson County residents opposed the dump. 
Opposition was surely even stronger than that, since poor residents without telephones were greatly underrepresented in the survey. Only 33 percent of respondents to this poll were Hispanic, while Hispanics account for 66 percent of the local population. As a general proposition, I understand that the dump is much more unpopular with the Latino majority than with the white minority. 
I don't know anyone who has ever attended a local meeting over the dump could have any doubts about how local residents feel. Over 700 county residents showed up at a public hearing on April 21, 1992. While 90 people spoke, only two supported the dump. At another public hearing in August 1996, over 80 percent of those attending spoke out against the dump. 
Local opponents of the dump have collected an overwhelming number of signatures in opposition. Over 800 local residents, all of them adults, have signed petitions opposing the dump. These include two out of four commissioners on the County Commissioner's Court--Wayne West and Curtis Carr. (A third commissioner--Jim Kiehne--has publicly stated his opposition). 
My understanding is that dump supporters have only managed to collect around 30 to 40 names. Many who signed the petitions in support of the dump later said they were confused; the petition claimed to be protecting Sierra Blanca from outside waste. Some of them have also signed petitions opposing the dump. 
I think the most reliable testimony about local opposition to the dump comes from Father Ralph Solis, the Catholic parish priest for Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County. He visited Washington in February to let Senators know how much his parishioners oppose their dump: 
Before leaving for Washington D.C., the people of the parish said to me, `Please, father, make them understand that we do not want radioactive nuclear waste.' All of us in far west Texas implore the Senate to take a good look at us and realize that we are real people in danger and without any real voice. . . . We beg the Senate to stand with us as like our sisters and brothers from other faiths and Christian denominations from across the country. I am here with this group from West Texas, a few small voices trying to speak for so many. Please, we beg you, do not abandon us. 
Citizens across the state seem to feel the same way. In a state wide poll conducted in October 1994, 82 percent of Texans opposed `the proposal to store out-of-state radioactive materials in Texas near Sierra Blanca.' Only 13 percent favored the proposal. 
Senators from Compact states have touted the views of two local figures as proof of Sierra Blanca's support for the dump. One of these individuals is a banker who heads the local economic development commission, which is funded by the Texas Waste Authority. My understanding is that he is a resident of Santa Teresita, not of Sierra Blanca. He developed a connection to Sierra Blanca in 1994 when he became president of the local bank. 
The other local figure is Judge James Peace, the County Judge who presides over the County Commissioners' Court. Both Judge Peace and other Compact supporters have claimed his reelection in March of this year, with 54 percent of the vote, is proof that local voters support the Compact. But can anyone honestly claim that the dump was an issue in his reelection campaign, or that local residents were aware of his position on the dump? 
An editorial in the Hudspeth County Herald of April 17, 1998, addresses Judge Peace's claims. It says that the March elections were not a referendum on the dump, and that many other issues were involved. `In no way, Judge Peace, was the dump implied in the last election.' More importantly, it says, `Your letter states that you have always been a vocal supporter of the dump . . . which is not true. Do you remember your first campaign? You told the folks when you sat in their living rooms that you were opposed to the dump.' 
Judge Peace recently traveled to Washington and met with me in my office. He is a very nice man, and I very much enjoyed our meeting. Indeed, Judge Peace told me directly to my face that he supports the Wellstone/Doggett amendment. He later wrote me a letter reversing his 
position. I can see why local residents might be a little confused about where he stands. 
Finally, it is argued that the Compact is a matter for the three states to decide, that selection of the dump site is Texas' business, and that outsiders should mind their own business. More specifically, I have been asked why, as a senator from Minnesota, I should have such a deep and abiding interest in this matter. 
The simple answer is that, if this were only a matter for the three states to decide, H.R. 629 would not be before the Senate. The Compact cannot go into effect without the consent of Congress. And the dump will not go forward without the Compact. 
The decision whether to build this dump depends on how we decide to proceed on this bill. That's what it boils down to. It is quite obvious to me that we cannot avoid responsibility for our votes and our actions in this matter. 
My driving concern has always been very simple. I cannot stand by and watch while a poor, politically powerless, Latino community is targeted to become the premier repository of low-level nuclear waste for the entire country. Much less give it my blessing. Not when I have the power to do something about it. 
As a very basic proposition, I think we can all agree that it's wrong for poor, politically powerless, minority communities to be singled out for the siting of unwanted hazardous waste dumps. It's wrong when that happens in Sierra Blanca, and it's wrong when it happens in hundreds of other poor minority communities all across this country. 
I want to do whatever I can to stop it, and I don't see why every one of us should not want to do the same. I don't understand why it should be considered unusual for a senator to care about these things. On the contrary, I think it should be unusual for a senator not to care about these things. 
The broader point is that environmental justice is not just a local issue, but a national one. There are some issues of fundamental justice that rise to a level of national importance, and this is surely one of them. 
I think it's high time for the Senate to just say `no.' Not just to the Sierra Blanca dump, but to a national pattern of discrimination in the location of waste and pollution. We have to face up to these urgent issues of environmental justice--sooner rather than later. 
The primary reason I came to the floor today was to draw my colleagues' attention to the pressing issue of environmental justice. But I had another motive as well. I wanted to explain the history of the debate over this bill. 
I wanted to make sure there is no confusion over what agreements have been made, how the Senate amendments would work, what the mandate of the conference committee is, and what we can expect if the conference violates that mandate. 
Let us step back for a moment and review how we got to where we are today. Over the past year I expressed vehement opposition to any Compact legislation that did not address the issue of environmental justice. I offered my two amendments in an effort to do just that. The resulting standoff prevented this bill from coming to floor for almost a year. 
Finally, about three months ago, senators from Compact states agreed to include my two amendments. On April 1 of this year, the Senate unanimously approved them both. 
Unfortunately, however, after agreeing to my amendments, senators from Compact states suggested publicly that the amendments should be stripped in conference committee. So as a condition of going to conference, I insisted that conferees be instructed to keep the amendments in any bill reported back to the Senate. 
Let me, since I will have time to talk more about this and I want to accommodate my colleague, talk about one other amendment that we have also attached to this piece of legislation. 
This amendment, Mr. President, essentially says, if colleagues are going to say that there should only be radioactive waste from Maine and Vermont, if that is what the Texas legislature intended, then we should make it clear when we pass this compact that that will be the case. This was the Doggett amendment in the House of Representatives which passed the House, and this was also a part of an amendment that has passed the Senate as well. 
Let me just kind of be clear about what this unanimous consent says. We are now instructing the conference committee that they are to support these two amendments, which the Senate has now gone on record supporting. All of my colleagues are on record, because the Senate has voted to support these two amendments, that the people at least should have a chance to go to court. And, if they can prove discrimination, they ought to be able to make their case. 
They ought to at least be able to make that appeal. And secondly, if we are saying that this waste is only going to come from Maine and Vermont because the people in Sierra Blanca and people of Texas are worried this will become a national repository site for nuclear waste, then we make it clear in the amendments that, indeed, will be the case. 
Now, Mr. President, in conclusion, although I will have more to say all week about this, Senators from the compact States were first reluctant to give those instructions. Their objections have delayed the conference for the last month. Then last week--and I am glad they did so--they withdrew their objections and agreed to insist on the Wellstone amendments. It was this agreement that will allow H.R. 629 to go to conference. 
In other words, I will keep my word all the way through. I said I was just trying to get these amendments onto the bill because I think these amendments would lead to much more fairness and much more justice for the people in Sierra Blanca. 
Well, now we are about to go to conference and I only want to emphasize one point. The Senate has now agreed unanimously, including Senators from the compact States, to instruct conferees on the Wellstone amendments. Conferees should not report back to the Senate any bill that has been stripped, where the amendments have been taken out. Without those environmental justice amendments, there should be no bill. If there is a compact which is approved without the people in Sierra Blanca having the right to challenge this in court, if they can show discrimination, and without the assurance that this waste will only come from Vermont and Maine, then this will be an injustice and the Senate should not let that happen. Any attempt to strip these amendments from the bill, which is what the nuclear utilities would like conferees to do, would make a mockery of the House and Senate votes to include the Wellstone and the Doggett language. It would make a mockery of Senate instructions and would make a mockery of our professed concern for environmental justice. 
When the House and Senate have both decided to include these amendments, the conference committee really has no business trying to strip them out. I think that would be the kind of backroom deal that makes Americans disgusted with politics. That would be the legislative process at its worst--serving the interests of the nuclear utilities over interests of people who lack comparable access to the levers of political power. 
If that happens, Mr. President, not only would Congress be denying a remedy for environmental discrimination, not only would Congress be giving a green light to the Sierra Blanca dump, not only would Congress be giving a seal of approval to the targeting of a poor majority-Latino community for disposal of radioactive waste, if the conference committee proceeded to drop these amendments, they would provide a striking example of unequal access to political power here in Washington that produces environmental discrimination in the first place. 
The issue of environmental justice deserves better than that. The people of Sierra Blanca deserve better than that. And the American people have a right to expect a higher level of conduct from their elected representatives. I will take advantage of every procedural means at my disposal to make sure that does not happen. 
Mr. President, to accommodate my colleague's schedule, the Presiding Officer, I conclude my remarks and yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is that we may have a vote soon on the amendment, so I will take a couple of minutes. My colleague from Massachusetts is here and others are here on the floor. Let me just say that I am honored to be a part of this effort and to join with Senators Kerry and Bond. And I appreciate the words spoken by my colleague from South Dakota. 
Mr. President, I will try to be succinct. The focus of this legislation is children. The focus of this legislation is, of course, to go after the addiction of children to tobacco, to focus on cessation programs, to focus on the goal of making sure that we don't have children addicted to this very lethal drug any longer, and to make sure that we, in fact, focus on the overall health of children in our country, and that we focus on ways in which children cannot only be healthy, but have hope and can do well in school and do well in their lives. 
In that respect, I think this amendment is right on point, right on target. We are talking about at least trying to make sure that about $6 billion-plus over the next 5 years would go to early childhood development, both for children before they go to kindergarten and also for afterschool care. 
I will just raise two questions in 2 minutes. No. 1, to tell you the truth--that is an interesting expression; it is not like everything else I have said has not been the truth--but to tell you the truth, I don't even know why it is that for some reason, somebody decided the only way we are going to have funding for child care in this country is out of a tobacco bill. I think if we really care about this, we are going to make the investment. But I also believe this is a very appropriate vehicle on which to have this focus. As my colleague from South Dakota said--and I know my colleague from Massachusetts will focus on this--we have all this research, and the Federal evidence is irrefutable, irreducible. We have to make sure that 
children by the age of 3 are ready for school and ready for life. If they are not, they may never do well in school; they may never do well in their lives. 
What more important investment, what more important feature of this legislation could we support than to make sure we invest in the health, skills, intellect, and character of our children? That is what this is about. It is related to how they feel about themselves, their confidence--both early childhood development before kindergarten and afterschool care. That is also related to the question of whether or not they care enough about themselves and feel good enough about themselves that they don't get addicted to tobacco and that they think about a positive life, about a healthy life, and about what they are going to do in their lives. 
This is an extremely important amendment which goes to the heart of what this legislation is supposed to be all about--public health, focusing on the improvement and the betterment of our children's lives, and all of these children are God's children. 
This amendment should pass. It is a bipartisan effort. I am very pleased to be on the floor supporting it. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak again--and I shall be relatively brief--about the nomination of James C. Hormel to be United States Ambassador to Luxembourg. 
I point out to colleagues that it has now been more than 8 months that his nomination has languished, awaiting an opportunity for us to consider this on the Senate floor. I have spoken on the floor before about Mr. Hormel. 
Let me just make one point. We in fact have voted before on Mr. Hormel when we made the decision as to whether or not he would be a representative to the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly. As I look at his qualifications, he has had a tremendous amount of success as a businessman, a tremendous amount of success as a lawyer, a tremendous amount of success in philanthropy, a tremendous amount of success from the point of view of very, very moving, very personal testimony by his former wife, his children, his family members, people who really know him well--and, I say to the Chair, people who know him not from the point of view of formal credentials, not from the point of view of any political fight, but from the point of view of kind of measuring the character of a person. 
My feeling is, colleagues can have different views about this nomination, but I believe it is extremely important that this nomination be brought to the floor. I've said it before. I have spoken any number of different times on the floor about Mr. Hormel. What I have said is that if there is a debate about his qualifications, that is quite one thing. If so, then let us have that debate. 
But I do not want the Senate to deny a nomination to anyone because of their sexual orientation. I think that would be discrimination. It's not just that I think that would be discrimination; it would be discrimination. And I think it is terribly important that the Senate take a long, hard look at itself and, at the very minimum, we have the debate. I think to be silent about this is a betrayal of what the Senate stands for, which is a fundamental respect for the dignity and worth of each and every person. 
The reason I come to the floor is just to say, colleagues, we have the tobacco bill before us. And we have had a number of amendments. We have still got a long ways to go. I do not know that I will bring an amendment to the floor on this bill or not, in any case. But certainly if not the tobacco bill, on the next bill--or the next appropriate vehicle, as soon as possible; the sooner the better--I will have an amendment which in some way puts a focus on this whole question of judging a person by the content of his or her character, judging them by their qualifications, judging them by their leadership, and in no way, shape, or form making any kind of judgment based upon any form of discrimination. 
Understand me, because I am talking--and a friend of mine is presiding, a good friend, someone whom I disagree with, but whom I really like a lot. And I hope it is mutual. I am not arguing that different people can't have different views, and I am not arguing that there are some who in very good faith may oppose this nomination. Absolutely not. But I just think that there are some big questions to be resolved here. 
It is terribly important we not just block this. It is terribly important we have an honest discussion and an honest debate and we have an up-or-down vote. I think my role as a Senator is to bring some amendments to the floor on pieces of legislation to put this into very sharp focus.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also, if I could, want to take just a few minutes to speak about Social Security, about its future, and about a campaign under way to trade it in for a privatized system like the one we have in Chile. 
President Clinton has called for a nationwide debate on Social Security for the balance of this year, to be followed by a White House conference in December and legislative action early next year. I think it is time--perhaps well past time--for the defenders of Social Security to speak up and be heard. 
As far as I am concerned, Social Security is one of America's proudest accomplishments of the 20th century. It has given retirement security to Americans of all ages and has rescued millions of seniors from the scourge of poverty. Everyone says they want to protect and preserve this remarkably efficient and effective program which is so beloved by the American people. But you would never know it, judging from the direction the debate is taking. 
The premise of the debate is that Social Security is on the verge of bankruptcy and must be transformed in order to survive. I strongly disagree. Social Security is not in crisis. It is not broke. It is not facing bankruptcy. It may need some modest adjustments, but the greatest dangers facing Social Security today are the many misguided proposals to `fix' it. 
You can hardly open a newspaper these days without reading about the impending collapse of Social Security. This is nonsense. Social Security is now taking in $101 billion more each year than it pays out in benefits. 
In April, the Social Security trustees reported that the trust funds will be able to cover benefits for the next 34 years, until the year 2032. After that, without any changes to the system, it will still be able to pay out 70 to 75 percent of the promised benefits, virtually indefinitely without any change whatever in the system. There is no reason why Social Security should come to an abrupt end in 2032 or any time thereafter. 
Some would seize upon this projected funding imbalance decades from now as an excuse to undermine the program. They want to replace Social Security with a privatized system in which retirement security depends solely on success in playing the financial markets. But why would we want to get rid of a program that has worked so well? Why should we want to `end Social Security as we know it?' In fact, that's what I think some of these proposals should be called--`ending Social Security as we know it.' 
If we really want to protect and preserve Social Security, we should be guided by two principles. First, we should focus all of our energies on the real problem, which is a possible imbalance in the trust funds after the year 2032. Second, under no circumstances should we allow funding for Social Security to be squandered on the fees, commissions, and overhead of Wall Street middlemen. 
There are a number of ways to go about this. Several prominent economists have come forward with detailed reform packages that would guarantee long-term balance of the trust funds. Other proposals will be coming out soon. These are relatively minor adjustments to the current system. They are not radical surgery. 
Privatization, on the other hand, is radical surgery. And it doesn't even solve the problem. In fact, it actually takes away money from the trust funds. 
How could that be? The answer is so-called `transition costs.' They are really going to be a huge problem. Right now, over 80 percent of payroll taxes are used to pay benefits for current retirees. Under a privatized system, those payroll taxes would be diverted into individual retirement accounts. But younger workers would still have to pay payroll taxes to fund benefits for current retirees. In effect, they would be paying twice. There is no way of doing that without increasing taxes, cutting benefits, or depleting the trust funds. 
Here is an idea: Instead of paying unnecessary transition costs, what if we used that money to restore the trust funds? The same goes for the more modest steps toward privatization now being discussed in Congress. Some members have proposed diverting 1, 2 or 3 percent of the 12.4-percent payroll tax into new individual accounts. Others would use a budget surplus to do the same thing. Instead of setting up private accounts, we could just as easily use that money to shore up the trust funds. That is the problem we are supposed to be fixing, isn't it? It's hard to explain how you are saving the trust funds when you're taking money out instead of putting money in. 
The important thing, Mr. President, is to stay focused. As our guiding principle, we should insist that any legislation purporting to save Social Security actually live up to its billing. It should reserve for the trust funds any new savings or revenues. We shouldn't let some speculative shortfall, 34 years from now, be used as an excuse to force through a very different--and, I would add, a very radical--agenda. 
Why are we getting sidetracked with individual accounts and privatization schemes that don't actually solve the problem? The reason is simple--money. Wall Street money, and lots of it. Mutual fund companies, stock brokerages, life insurance companies and banks are all salivating at the prospect of 130 million 
potential new customers coming their way. Privatization of Social Security could bring them untold billions of dollars in extra fees and commissions. That is why they have invested millions of dollars in a massive public relations campaign promoting privatization, and they are doing a heck of a good job of it. That is one reason why they have contributed so heavily to congressional and Presidential campaigns. The heavy hitters, the big givers, they are heavily involved in this campaign. 
Let me read from a story in the Washington Post on September 30, 1996. The headline says, `Wall Street's Quiet Message: Privatize Social Security.' 
It reads: 
Wall Street is putting its weight behind the movement in Washington to privatize Social Security . . . 
Lobbyists for Wall Street are trying to stay behind the scenes as they argue for privatization because they and their firms so obviously stand to profit by the changes they are promoting, according to financial industry executives. Representatives of mutual funds, brokerages, life insurance companies, and banks are involved in a lobbying effort to have the government let Wall Street manage a slice of Social Security's money . . . 
Representatives of investment firms have begun lobbying Capitol Hill and the White House to advance their agenda, according to financial service industry executives . . . 
Wall Street officials want to avoid or at least deflect accusations that they are seeking to transform Social Security to line their own purses. 
And, I might add, their own purposes. 
There has been some very good reporting in the Post, in the Wall Street Journal, and elsewhere on exactly who is paying how much money to whom. 
It is absolutely unbelievable the way in which these Wall Street interests have hijacked this debate. It is time for those of us who want to protect this system to stand up and begin to speak out and fight back against these very radical efforts to privatize a social insurance program that has been such a huge success, not just for senior citizens, but for our parents and our grandparents. 
I think it would be a tragedy if we stood by and let the trust funds be squandered by Wall Street--and squandered on Wall Street. In Chile, where they privatized Social Security in 1981, an estimated 19 percent of worker contributions gets skimmed off the top by pension companies. That's 19 percent skimmed off the top by the middlemen. 
Social Security in our country, by contrast, has administrative costs of less than 1 percent with no fees, no commissions. One percent administrative costs, no fees, no commissions, not going to the big Wall Street interests. And now we have these efforts to privatize the system and turn over a large part of the surplus to Wall Street? Unbelievable. 
Champions of privatization like to brag about higher returns on the stock market as compared to Social Security. I think those claims are exaggerated. But even if they were true, you don't need individual accounts managed by Wall Street campaign contributors to capture the higher yields. You would get the same average returns if Social Security did the investing itself. And that way, seniors would still be guaranteed a monthly benefit indexed for inflation. 
I'm not saying we should do that, necessarily. Stock markets go down as well as up. With all the financial turmoil in Asia and Russia right now, we might want to think twice about betting the future of the trust funds on go-go emerging markets. But whatever we do, we should insist that the trust fund money not be siphoned off to Wall Street middlemen. 
I want to say that again to my colleagues. We might want to think twice about betting the future of the trust funds on go-go emerging markets. But whatever we do, we should insist that this trust fund money not be siphoned off to the Wall Street middlemen, which is actually what the privatization proposals do. 
Our immediate focus should be on fixing the problem at hand--a projected shortfall in the trust funds 34 years in the future. We should not be diverting resources to half-baked schemes that would only make the problem worse. 
We should not let Wall Street campaign contributors push through a `reform plan' that would only give them a slice of the trust funds. Privatization is a phony solution to a phony crisis. 
Social Security has been phenomenally successful for over a half a century--60 years. It ensures millions of Americans against disability, death of a spouse, and destitution in their old age. Compared to private retirement plans, it is a very good deal. And it is the most successful antipoverty program America has ever devised. 
It is simple. You reach the age of 62 or 65, you get older, you are no longer working, your earnings decline. There was a time when probably half of the poverty population in our country were the elderly. That was a national disgrace. That is no longer the case. This is a very successful program. 
While all of us should be saving more, the fact is that there will always be millions and millions of Americans who depend solely on Social Security for their retirement security. In fact, as fewer and fewer Americans have employer-provided pensions and as businesses are rapidly shifting from defined benefit plans to defined contribution, we need Social Security now more than ever. This is no time to end `Social Security as we know it.' 
We now have proposals, privatization schemes, to `end Social Security as we know it.' That is what this is all about. I am amazed that we have not had more discussion about how to modify and support Social Security as opposed to the privatization schemes that dismantle Social Security. 
I will give some of my colleagues credit. They have been able to take, 34 years in the future, a potential shortfall and reduce it to an agenda that dismantles the Social Security system as we know it. 
We need to have a major discussion and debate over this. In the coming weeks and months, I plan to be talking at great length about how we can correct the projected shortfall 34 years from now without ending Social Security as we know it. Right now, friends of Social Security are generating a number of proposals that do not amount to radical surgery. Those ideas deserve to be heard. Advocates for the privatization plan favored by Wall Street should not have a monopoly over this debate. If we have a fully informed discussion and all options are really on the table, I am very confident that the American people will support a progressive solution that does not end Social Security as we know it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. Not that there are not other Senators who are connected to people back in their States, but the Senator from Georgia, I think, among us, stands out as a Senator who is really connected to people he represents. When he uses the word `fight,' I think he will be fighting very hard for people and I think we will have really a historically significant debate on this legislation. 
This is a very personal issue for people we are talking about, I say to my colleague, their health and the health of their children. So I thank the Senator from Georgia for his very strong words.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on June 6, 1968, at 1:44 a.m., Bobby Kennedy passed away. I would like to speak about Senator Kennedy. First of all, I just recommend for people in Minnesota and our country a wonderful documentary that will be shown this week on TV on the Discovery Channel, `Robert F. Kennedy, A Memoir.' This was done by Jack Newfield and Charlie Stewart. My wife Sheila and I had a chance to see 2 hours of this, a preview. It is very powerful. 
I thought what I would do is read from a book which just came out, written by one of Bobby Kennedy's children, Maxwell Taylor Kennedy. The title of it is `Make Gentle The Life Of The World.' This is an excerpt from one of Bobby Kennedy's speeches: 
Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago, `to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of the world.' Thus the title, `Make Gentle The Life Of The World.' 
Let me just say at the beginning, before quoting from some of Bobby Kennedy's speeches, that I believe--this is just my opinion--that the Senator who really most lives this tradition, of course in a very personal way, but in terms of his just unbelievable advocacy for people and the kind of courage and power, the effectiveness of his advocacy for people, of course, is Senator Ted Kennedy. 
Behind me is the desk of President John Kennedy, which is Senator Edward Kennedy's desk. I can't think of any Senator who better represents the words I am now about to quote. 
Bobby Kennedy gave a speech. I believe it was at the University of Kansas. He wanted to talk to students and young people. He wanted to talk about the way in which we measure ourselves as a people. It is one of my favorite speeches, and I quote a part of it: 
Yet, the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children-- 
In other words, do we measure how we are doing as a country just by the economic indicators. 
Yet, the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America, except why we are proud that we are Americans. 
Mr. President, another speech that Senator Kennedy gave is relevant to our times: 
There are millions of Americans living in hidden places whose faces and names we never know, but I've seen children starving in Mississippi, idling their lives away in the ghetto, living without hope or future amid the despair on Indian reservations with no jobs and little help. I've seen proud men in the hills of Appalachia who wish only to work in dignity, but the mines are closed and the jobs are gone and no one, neither industry nor labor nor Government, has cared enough to help. Those conditions will change, those children will live only if we dissent. So I dissent, and I know you do, too. 
Interesting words about crime: 
Thus, the fight against crime is, in the last analysis, the same as the fight for equal opportunity, or the battle against hunger and deprivation, or the struggle to prevent the pollution of our air and water. It is the fight to preserve the quality of community which is at the root of our greatness, a fight to preserve confidence in ourselves and our fellow citizens, a battle for the quality of our lives. 
About the importance of work: 
We need jobs, dignified employment at decent pay. 
What many today call living-wage jobs.  
The kind of employment that lets a man-- 
And I add, and I am sure Senator Kennedy would add, a woman---- say to his community, to his family, to his country and, most important, to himself [or herself], `I helped to build this country; I'm a participant in this great public venture; I am a man'-- 
And, I add, `I am a woman.' 
The importance of work-- 
Community: 
Today, we can make this a nation where young people do not see the false peace of drugs. Together, we can make this a nation where old people are not shunted off, where regardless of the color of his skin or the place of birth of his father, every citizen will have an equal chance at dignity and decency.  Together, Americans are the most decent, generous and compassionate people in the world. Divided, they are collections of islands--islands of blacks afraid of islands of whites; islands of northerners bitterly opposed to islands of southerners, islands of workers warring with islands of businessmen. 
Government: 
Governments can err, Presidents do make mistakes, but the immortal Dante tells us that divine justice weighs the sins of the cold-blooded and the sins of the warm-hearted in a different scale. Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of charity than the consistent emissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference. 
Courage--I think the pages will especially like this: 
It is from numberless, diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up-- 
Or a woman stands up-- for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance. 
These are really beautiful words. 
Mr. President, I had an opportunity about a year ago to travel just to a few communities Senator Kennedy visited. I started out in the delta, Mississippi, and actually just this past Friday, a week ago, I went back to Tunica in the delta, just by myself, mainly to teach classes. I went back because there was a marvelous teacher, Mr. Robert Hall, who said a year ago at a community meeting, `I wish you could come back around graduation time, because only about 50 percent or just a little bit more of our students graduate, and our students need to have more hope.' 
In Tunica, the public high school is all African-American, and the private schools are all white. So I came back. I landed, and a man named Mr. Young picked me up at the airport. He said, `Before you go to the high school, you will be addressing the third and fourth graders.' I say to the Chair, I thought to myself, addressing the third and fourth graders the last day of school, like a policy address? It didn't sound like this was going to work very well. 
I went to the elementary school, and the third and fourth graders were all sitting in the auditorium. A principal, a young man, introduced me, and we were high on the stage. I told the principal, `I think I will not stay on the stage.' I went out to where the students were. 
This one young girl helped me out so much, because we were talking about education and school and why you like school. She said, `I like it because a good education will help me be all I want to be in my life.' Then 40 hands went up at one time. That is a teacher's dream, and these children had all sorts of dreams--doctors, lawyers, psychiatrists, professional wrestlers, boxers, football players--you name it--teachers, on and on and on. I thought to myself, this is what it is about. The only problem is that for too many children, that is the way they start out, and then this just gets taken away from them. The same spark isn't there later on by the time they get to high school. 
I then went to East L.A. and to Watts and went to public housing projects in Chicago and inner-city Baltimore and Letcher County, KY, and inner-city Minneapolis, Phillips neighborhood, rural Minnesota. The point is there are heroines, and heroines are doing great work. That is my point. 
The other point is, everywhere I went, I really believe--and these are my words, I summarize it--what part of the people were saying with a lot of dignity was, `What happened to our national vow of equal opportunity for every child? We don't have it in our communities.' 
And the jobs--where are the jobs with decent wages? That is what we want to be able to do. Just think about Robert Kennedy's words, about the importance of work. That is what people are saying today. `We want to have jobs at decent wages so that we can earn a decent living and we can give our children the care we know they need and deserve.' 
Really, Mr. President, as I think about that travel--and travel in any community--this is the focus: On jobs and education, health care, earning a decent living, being able to do well for your children. That is the focus. 
Different people think about Senator Kennedy's career, Bobby Kennedy, and what he stood for, and different people in different ways, to try to use that inspiring example to do good work. I want to just raise one question before the Senate today, as I feel that this is very connected to Senator Kennedy's life and what he tried to do for our country. And this is the question. I pose this question for my colleagues and the people in the country: How can it be that in the United States of America today--not June of 1968--June of 1998, how can it be the richest, most affluent country in the world, at the peak of our economic performance--we are all writing about how well the economy is doing--how can it be that we are still being told that we cannot provide a good education for every child, that we cannot provide good health care for all of our citizens, that people still cannot find jobs at decent wages that they can support their families on, that we cannot at least reach the goal of making sure that every child who comes to kindergarten is ready to learn? She knows how to spell her name; she knows colors and shapes and sizes; she knows the alphabet; she has been read to widely; and she or he is ready to learn. And we are still being told we can't reach those goals as a nation? 
And how can it be that in our peak economic performance today, one out of four children under the age of 3 are growing up poor in America--under the age of 3; and one out of every two children of color under the age of 3 are growing up poor in our country? How can this be? How can it be that we have a set of social arrangements that allow children to be the most poverty-stricken group in America? That is a betrayal of our heritage. The impoverishment of so many children is our national disgrace. 
I just feel--and I am just speaking for myself--as I think back about Robert Kennedy's life, he would surely say today that this is not acceptable and that we can do better. He would probably say, `We can do betta.' And I think those words are very important. 
One final point, if my colleague would indulge me. 
I had a chance to speak at a baccalaureate at Swarthmore College this last weekend. And I was saying to the students--a lot of people have given up on politics. A lot of people, it is not that they don't care about the issues, they care deeply, they care desperately, but they don't think there is much of a connection between their concerns and our concerns. They read all about money in politics, and they just do not think it is that important. 
A friend of mine was telling me he was teaching a seminar class on electoral politics, and he was talking about Presidential races and some of his involvement in the past, and students said, `Well, that's when elections mattered.' Elections do matter. All of us in public service, I think, 
believe that, even if we have different viewpoints. 
I said to the students--and I want to conclude this way, in just talking with young people, not at young people--that I read--and certainly this was the case in Swarthmore College--an incredibly high percentage of students in our colleges and universities are involved in community service, and also high school students. It is not true that young people do not care about community, do not want to serve our country. There is a tremendous amount of good work being done. The problem is that I think many young people say community service is good and politics is unsavory. 
I just say today, on the floor of the Senate, to the young people: We need you to be mentors and tutors. We need your community service. We need you to volunteer at battered women's shelters. If my wife Sheila was here, she would say, `Mention that, Paul.' We need you to be advocates for children. We need you to help other children. We need you to do community work. When you go on to college and universities and get degrees, and you are lawyers and businesspeople, we need you to take some of your skills and give it to the community. We need you to do that. But we also need you to care about public policy. We need you to care about good public policy, and we need you to make sure that our Nation does better. 
Mr. President, I want to say today--since I wanted to take a few minutes to speak about Robert Kennedy and his life, the meaning of that life, to me and I think to many Americans--I think that the final point that I would want to make--feels right to me, at least--is to say, especially to younger people, the future is not going to belong to those who are content with the present. The future is not going to belong to cynics; it is not going to belong to people who stand on the sidelines; it is not going to belong to people who view politics as a spectator sport. 
The future is going to belong to people who have passion and people who are willing to make a personal commitment to making our country better. And the future is going to belong--these are not Bobby Kennedy's words; these are Eleanor Roosevelt's words--`The future is going to belong to people who believe in the beauty of their dreams.' 
Bobby Kennedy had many beautiful dreams. His life was cut short, and he was not able to realize all those dreams. But his dreams and his hope and his work for our country is as important to our Nation today as it ever was while he was alive. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, earlier this week, I spoke of a resolution on China that I introduced and that we will offer as an amendment as soon as there is a vehicle to work with, I think probably next week--certainly before the President's visit to China. I wanted to briefly summarize it. Let me just say that I am really pleased to have the support of Senator Lugar, Senator Durbin, Senator Leahy and Senator Feingold, and I think there will be very strong bipartisan support for this, what will be an amendment. 
The focus is on human rights conditions in China and Tibet. Let me just say I don't come to the floor in a spirit of bashing our President. Since our President will be the first head of state of our country to visit China since the 1989 crackdown where really students--I see pages here--young people your age were murdered, gave their lives, and for the `crime' of just simply calling for the country to be a democracy, I wish the President would not go to Tiananmen Square. I think that is a mistake. My worry is that regardless of what statements the President makes about human rights in China--and I hope he will make some powerful statements--the symbolism of visiting that very sacred place where students were murdered will overwhelm everything else and will be taken, will be used by the Government or will be interpreted by people in China as reflecting a kind of carte blanche support of the Government. I think that would be a mistake. 
Now, I want to refer to the State Department's China country report this past year on human rights and practices. This is not my report. This is our own State Department report. 
The Government continues to commit widespread and well documented human rights abuses in violation of internationally accepted norms stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms. 
I think the Assistant Secretary of State, John Shattuck, who has focused on human rights, has really done some magnificent work, and I think this State Department report is extremely important. 
What we are going to call on the President to do in our amendment--and we will have a vote on it next week. I think it is terribly important the Senate go on record before the President's visit, because the President is going to visit China. Whether Senators think he should or not, the President is going to visit. I personally think it is not unimportant to be having a discussion with the Government there. I am not opposed to a discussion. But the question is what kind of discussion, what kind of visit, and what does the President say. 
At the very minimum, we are going to call upon the President to secure from China's leaders a pledge to remove by a certain date the names on the official reentry black list, which now contains the names of more than 50 Chinese living in the United States who cannot return to China because of their advocacy of democracy and freedom. In other words, there are some people in our country who think the fact that Wei Jingsheng, who was released from prison, is now in our country, exiled in our country is a sign he has his freedom. I doubt any American would feel he or she was free if they were exiled from our country and told, if you come back to the United States, you will be immediately arrested. That hardly represents freedom. So we want to make sure that by a certain date the Chinese 
Government removes these names on this official reentry blacklist. 
Second of all, that the President--and let me emphasize this. I emphasized it this morning--visit family members of the victims of the 1989 massacre, many of whom still suffer from political harassment, discrimination, or persecution. 
I will say in this Chamber: Mr. President, if you are going to visit China, I hope you don't go to Tiananmen Square. I hope you will give some forceful speeches on human rights, but at the very minimum you could convey a very powerful message to the world, to people in China, to the Chinese Government, and to these families if you would visit the family members, or some of the family members of victims of the 1989 massacre, many of whom today suffer from political harassment and discrimination and persecution. I think that would be a powerful message. I believe the President should do this. 
Third of all, I think the President absolutely has to urge Chinese leaders to engage in a meaningful dialog with the Dalai Lama, with the aim of establishing genuine cultural and religious autonomy in Tibet. In the past year, matters have only gotten worse in Tibet. No one is arguing to the contrary. No one is arguing to the contrary. 
The President must call upon China to revise its vague, draconian security laws, including the provisions on `endangering state security,' which were added to the criminal code in March of 1997; and release unconditionally all political, religious, and labor activists detained for their peaceful, nonviolent involvement. In other words, it is important to understand, when someone like Wei is released, that releasing some individuals doesn't deal with 2,000 political prisoners that you have in prison. That doesn't deal with all sorts of prisoners in forced labor camps. The President has to call upon the Chinese Government to live up to basic human rights standards--that is where our country should be; that is what we should stand for--and review the sentences of more than 2,000 who have been convicted of so-called counterrevolutionary crimes with a view toward granting full amnesty. 
Mr. President, I come to the floor today because it is the anniversary of the massacre at Tiananmen Square, and I think it is really important that we speak up. I think the Chinese Government would like nothing more than for Americans not to speak up. I think the Chinese Government would like for the world to forget what happened. We cannot. But above and beyond that, I do not want this just to be dramatic in the worst way or symbolic. I think what the President can do if he is going to visit China is not go to Tiananmen Square, certainly visit the families of the victims of Tiananmen Square, and certainly give some powerful speeches and statements while in China which call upon the Chinese Government to release people who are in prison for having committed no other crime than to speak out for democracy and freedom; for the President to say to the Government of China--frankly, we should be saying it to governments all over the world that do this--you cannot persecute people because of their religious practice or because of their political viewpoint. We have to be on the side of human rights throughout the world. I really hope that next week, if not tomorrow--the first opportunity I get I will bring this amendment to the floor --we would get very strong support for this amendment. 
Mr. President, I see my colleague from Nevada is here, and I will yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to my colleague from Arizona I had a chance yesterday to speak in the Chamber, and I have been wanting to say this while he is in the Chamber. I read a very eloquent and really beautiful piece in the Washington Post he had written about Senator Goldwater, who was, I suppose, on the opposite side of the spectrum from where I stand, but I talked about how especially in recent years--I never knew Senator Goldwater, never had a chance to talk with him, but in recent years as I have read about him and seen some of the things he said, I have so much respect for the way in which he kind of tied together personal, intellectual and political integrity. 
I say to my colleague from Arizona, who will probably disagree with the rest of what I say over the next several minutes, I do believe when it comes to conscience and integrity we do have somebody who lives up to that very high standard Senator Goldwater set. And that is Senator McCain from Arizona. The only thing I didn't agree with in the article the Senator wrote was when Senator McCain said he will just be a mere footnote in Senate history. I do not agree with that. I think Senator McCain is an enormously important force here in the Senate and in the country, and I better not go any further with that because I am about to disagree with the rest of what he said.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I agree with really what both my colleagues have had to say, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and Senator McCain, about what our goal is with this legislation, that we ought to keep our eye on the prize. The goal is to reduce youth smoking and to save the lives of children in our country and, I would argue, also children throughout the world. 
In that regard, from my perspective, not from the point of view of being macho, I say to my colleague from Arizona, but from a point of view of what I think would be the best public policy that would make a difference, I think we took a step backwards when we did not raise the price increase of cigarettes to $1.50 per pack. Senator Kennedy's amendment, I think, was on the mark because I think if we had done that over 3 years, demand, indeed, being elastic, would have gone down in a very significant way especially with young people. 
But regardless of the debate on that amendment, we move forward. Senator McCain has labored long and hard to make this a good bill. So have other Senators--Senator Kerry and Senator Hollings and others. But again we all agree that the reduction of youth smoking and the protection of children's lives should be the primary goal of this legislation. So let us just say we are in agreement in that goal. 
Now, we are forced to come to the floor of the Senate--and I am going to speak about Senator Durbin's look-back provisions--and fight hard for children and young people for some protection because big tobacco for decades has employed legions of marketers who were paid to find ways in which they could addict our children and procure them as future long-term customers. 
That is exactly what it has been all about. That was the mandate that the advertising agents received from the tobacco industry. This industry poured a tremendous amount of its wealth and its talent in what they viewed as their mission. And, oh boy, were they successful. We have heard it many times now; we hear it every day. Senator McCain just recited the same statistic; 3,000 kids start smoking each day in our country alone, and a third of them, at least a third of them, will die a premature death due to tobacco-related illness. So these tobacco companies know how to market and they know how to do it well. They are experts. They have been experts at whispering in our children's ear and seducing them to smoke. So let us now get these companies to use their expertise to change the tenor of these whispers and to have them induce our children not to smoke. 
For a long, long, long time--too long a time--they targeted our children, they whispered in their ears, they seduced them to smoke. They have the expertise. Now what we are going to do is provide them with incentives to, in fact, get our children not to smoke. These companies are responsible, or have been responsible, for what Dr. David Kessler calls the `pediatric disease of smoking.' Let me repeat that, `the pediatric disease of smoking.' 
That is what the look-back provisions are all about. They are to make the tobacco companies responsible for meeting certain youth-reduction goals, and they hold them financially accountable if they fail to reach these goals. Senator McCain is to be commended for the inclusion of look-back provisions in the bill which we have before us today. But I think, not from the point of view of trying to destroy the industry but from the point of view of how we can, in fact, make sure we have the right incentives to get these companies to make an all-out effort not to target children and, in fact, reduce the number of children who are smoking, I think we have to have stronger and better incentives. That is why I come to the floor to support the Durbin-DeWine amendment. 
I think what this amendment does, which is most important, is that it makes the payments or the penalties for missing the youth-reduction targets more company specific as opposed to primarily industry-wide. 
I am worried about the industry-wide approach for a couple of different reasons. First of all, I think what will probably happen is that the industry, as a whole, will just simply say: Look, there is no particular incentive for any one company to really go all-out to reduce teenage smoking and we will just kind of share the additional cost. But, you know what? In the long run, it will be more profitable to do that. 
The problem is that there is a negative incentive for companies to try to live up to our goal. After all the goal is to reduce teenage smoking. The goal is to dramatically reduce this addiction. The goal is to dramatically reduce the death of people in our country. Therefore, it would seem to me that if some companies are doing all they can to meet that goal but other companies are not, and the industry as a whole doesn't do the job, then everybody ends up having to pay a penalty, and there is simply no incentive for a company to do right. The way it stands now, if a certain company does make the effort to stop children from smoking their cigarettes, but the rest of the industry doesn't, then the company that did make the positive attempt is punished more than any other. First, they are hit by the industry wide look back payments even though they made every good-faith effort to do the right thing. And, second of all, by doing the right thing they are financially burdened by the loss of their youth market. 
So it seems to me the look-back provisions in the bill as they now stand are flawed, and I think to make the incentives or disincentives more company-based, more specific-company focused, is a much more effective public policy way of reaching our goal, which is to have a dramatic reduction of teenage smoking. 
The Durbin-DeWine amendment is also, I think, a strong improvement because it raises the 10-year reduction goal from 60 percent to 67 percent. In our committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which for a short period of time had jurisdiction over this legislation, Senator Kennedy had an amendment which passed the committee which would have raised the goal to 80 percent, an 80-percent reduction in youth smoking. We heard from any number of different experts who said you can do that. We can do that and we should. This is truly one place where we ought to set the bar as high as we can because we are talking about children's lives. Children's lives are precious to all of us. So I think by going to 67 percent, we have made a solid improvement that is easily doable and I think we should set the goal this high. 
Let me just finish up this way. I now come back to why I come to the floor to support the Durbin-DeWine amendment, which I think 
is a much more effective way of reducing youth smoking. I think the look-back provisions as they now stand are flawed. I do not think they are going to work well. So we want to have a piece of legislation which will be as strong as possible and will work well. 
I say to my colleague from Arizona, no company gets put out of existence. Every single company that makes a good-faith, all-out effort to reach these achievable goals and reaches them, will not have any problem at all. Those companies will have no look-back payments to make. It is simple. There is no reason, no inherent reason in this amendment that Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine have brought to the floor, why any companies would have to worry about going out of existence if, in fact, they make a commitment to live up to these goals. And that is what it is all about. 
I think the language of money is, in fact, the only language to which this industry has responded. While the pleas of parents and children and dying victims might fall on deaf ears, and they have for a long time, the clinking of coins is a sound to which they are most surely attuned. 
So I think right now we have some provisions in the legislation that I do not think will work that well. I think this amendment that Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine have brought to the floor makes a lot more sense. Because if companies choose to use their marketing powers to discourage teenagers from smoking, which is exactly what this look-back provision will encourage them to do, they will avoid any look-back payments and at the same time they will improve America's long-term health. I think that is what this legislation is all about. 
Since I have some additional time here, I want to let my colleagues know that I will be introducing an amendment to extend the advertising protections that children here in the United States will enjoy, to extend those protections to children around the world. My understanding is that the amendment tree is filled right now, but I want to talk a little bit about this amendment. Again, as I have already said, the purpose of this legislation is the reduction of youth smoking. I believe the amendment I will introduce will further that goal and because it will it should have strong support from this body. What I am concerned about are some of the provisions in the legislation that deal with the international activities of this renegade industry. I think those provisions are inadequate. 
What I want to do is to make sure that the advertising and marketing restrictions that we have in this legislation also apply to the international scope of these tobacco companies just the way Senator McCain's bill was written when it passed out of Commerce Committee by a 19-to-1 vote. So, for example, if we are going to say: Look, industry, you are not going to be able to use cartoon characters to market your deadly products here in the United States of America; I would like to say to these companies: You are not going to be able to use these cartoon characters to market these deadly products in any market overseas. 
I'd like to provide a little context for my colleagues. I will address this subject in more depth later on, but I wanted to draw from some interesting documents my State of Minnesota was able to obtain when Minnesota forced the tobacco industry to disgorge documents so revealing that the industry has been hiding them for years. An R.J. Reynolds document, penned in 1976, reads:  
Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14-18 year old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR-(tobacco) must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained in the long term. 
Or this from Philip Morris, in 1981: 
Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens . . . The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris. 
The amendment I will introduce will basically say we need to put our foot down. We ought to say: No more. No more addicting of children. Tobacco industry, you need to cease and desist from diabolic marketing tactics which target children, which addict children, and which ultimately lead to the premature death of too many people, here and abroad. 
Some statistics about what Dr. Kessler has called the pediatric disease of smoking. The World Health Organization projects a staggering global death and disease burden related to tobacco use. The WHO estimates that one-third of the world's population over the age of 15 currently smokes--one-third. This is equal to 1.1 billion smokers. Of those 1.1 billion smokers, over 90 percent live outside the United States and over 70 percent live in developing countries. 
Let me simply mention a couple of other interesting statistics that I will again get a chance to develop in this argument a little later on. I will give just a few examples. Over the last decade in which U.S. sales have declined by 17 percent, U.S. cigarette exports have grown by a staggering 260 percent. 
In 1996 alone, U.S. manufacturers exported a record 243.9 billion cigarettes--243.9 billion cigarettes. I have to say to my colleague from Arizona, I am not out here to bash, but I honestly and truthfully believe and can marshal evidence--and I will when we get to debate this amendment--that big tobacco has been absolutely shameless in its efforts to addict children, not only in our country but abroad as well. 
For example, if we are going to say, look, this is about reducing teenage smoking, this is about saving children's lives, I think a child is a child. We are talking about all of God's children. These advertisements have been shameful. They have been irresponsible. But, unfortunately, they also have been very successful. 
It is no surprise that when U.S. companies go into overseas markets, teenage smoking rates quickly climb. In Russia, from 1992 to 1993 smoking rates among 13 to 16-year-olds increased from 31.5 percent to 42.5 percent as a result of targeting efforts by tobacco companies. 
Smoking rates among male Korean teenagers rose from 18 percent to 30 percent in just 1 year after the entry of U.S. tobacco companies. Let me repeat that: Smoking rates among male Korean teenagers rose from 18 to 30 percent in just 1 year after the entry of U.S. tobacco companies. 
Just 2 years after Taiwan's cigarette market was opened to U.S. companies, the smoking rate among high school students increased 50 percent. In both Taiwan and Japan, U.S. brands jumped from 1 percent to 20 percent of the market in less than 2 years. 
The United States National Cancer Policy Board has noted that the introduction of U.S. cigarettes in Japan `had the regrettable effect of contributing to an increase in overall tobacco consumption, especially among those under the age of 20.' That is from the U.S. National Cancer Policy Board. 
My amendment will simply state that American tobacco companies, and those they control, are prohibited from selling, distributing or marketing tobacco products to children overseas, just as they will be prohibited from such activities in the United States. 
I have to say to you, Mr. President, that the good news is the bill that was passed by the Commerce Committee by a 19-to-1 vote had basically the same language as this amendment. And I say let us get that language back in the bill. 
My concern, as a United States Senator from Minnesota, is how can we dramatically reduce smoking among teenagers, among young people? How can we stop this shameless targeting of kids? Again, we had document after document after document. I know my colleague who is presiding has debated this. He has raised important questions--I always give that to him--and he argues his case forcefully about lawyers and lawyers' fees and all the rest. Fair enough. We have debated that, and we will debate it again. 
I will say this: In the Minnesota court case which was recently settled, it is incredible the number of documents and the amount of information we were able to get out before the public. 
Those documents tell a very disturbing story of an industry which in a very shameless way targeted kids and went all out to addict children. What I will be doing with this amendment that I will offer is to say, look, if we are going to be concerned about marketing to children in our country, then we also ought to be concerned about it with children abroad. The United States of America ought not to be known around the world, especially in these poor developing countries, as a country with an industry that is a leading exporter of death. That ought not to be our identity with people in those countries. I think the same marketing restrictions should apply. You no longer can use cartoon characters to push the buttons of children and addict them to tobacco in our country, and you are not going to do it in other countries either. That will be the gist of the amendment I intend to introduce. 
Mr. President, I do not see any colleagues on the floor, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I only heard about his remarks. Let me thank my colleague from Arizona for coming to the floor to speak. I am sure we will hear from Senator McCain as well, if we haven't already. 
As a Senator, I suppose, on the other side of the ideological continuum--if that is, in fact, even relevant; sometimes I don't think it is. I don't think politics has that much to do with left to right to center; I think it has more to do with trying to do well for people, and we have all reached different conclusions about how to do that. But it is about public service. I just want to say to the Goldwater family that I think Barry Goldwater really set a standard, especially when it comes to personal integrity and intellectual integrity and political integrity. And I think people in our country really yearn for that. His outspokenness, and especially his courage, and especially in recent years his willingness to speak out, even after no longer being in office, to continue to serve our country I think really is inspiring for all of us. 
I wish to add my words to the really fine words of the Senator from Arizona.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to introduce a resolution today that I will send to the desk. This will be on behalf of--I will do it after my remarks--myself and Senators Durbin and Leahy. 
This is a resolution calling upon the President to make human rights a major priority in his June visit to China. Probably later on we will introduce this resolution in the form of a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the Department of Defense bill. 
Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution calling upon the President to make human rights a major priority in his June visit to China. Thus far, the Administration has not articulated any concrete goals or objectives for the upcoming summit, other than to demonstrate a friendly relationship between the U.S. and China. Preliminary negotiations with the Chinese leadership on the summit agenda indicate that Beijing is unlikely to make any major policy concessions when it comes to human rights. 
I am not opposed--I think I need to say that again--to high-level discussions with the Chinese leadership. In fact, I think they can be very useful. But I am worried about the symbolism of a Presidential visit, and I think it may backfire if the President does not continue to speak out about our strong concerns when it comes to China's human rights record. The summit could be interpreted by many as legitimizing policies of the Chinese regime which, despite some legal reforms, continue to repress religious freedom and political freedom as well as political dissent. 
The Chinese have avidly sought a Presidential visit because it signals to all at home and abroad that the U.S. has muffled its opposition to, and endorses cooperation with the Beijing government, the same government that continues to deny its citizens basic human rights and freedoms. By agreeing to a Presidential visit, without significant human rights preconditions--not merely token gestures--I fear that the Administration may be squandering a tremendous source of leverage with the Chinese government. 
Since the May 1994 decision to delink trade and human rights, the Administration has not yet developed an effective bilateral or multilateral strategy for promoting meaningful improvements in human rights conditions in China and Tibet. I was deeply disappointed this year that despite a 95 to 5 vote in support here in the Senate, the Administration did not sponsor a resolution on China's human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, which is exactly the place you would bring such a resolution forward. We didn't do so. Mr. Wei, China's best known political dissident, has pointed out that the Chinese people view the commission's work as `barometer' to the human rights commission which met in Geneva by which to judge whether there is any international backing for their democracy movement in their country of China. 
Our current policy may send a message to those brave men and women who risk their lives to campaign for democracy and freedom that the United States is not behind them. 
By the way, I apply the standard to human rights or violations of human rights in all kinds of countries, be they left or be they right; it makes no difference. 
In a speech that Mr. Wei presented at the Commission in Geneva, he recalled, `Last year, when the Commission failed to adopt a resolution on China, my prison guards laughed at me and said: `Look at your so-called friends. They betrayed you,' He went on to say, `This is precisely the time when support from our friends is most needed. And this is precisely the time that Western democracies have chosen to withdraw their support.' 
The Administration claims that China has made progress in the area of human rights. In my view, this is simply not true. The recent steps taken by the Chinese government are merely token, cosmetic gestures--diplomatic bargaining tactics that do not amount to a more open, free society. The overall pattern of human rights violations remains fundamentally unchanged. 
While I wholeheartedly welcome China's announcement to sign the International Covenant on civil and Political Rights, until it is actually signed and ratified, it is not fully binding. Two months after their pledge to sign, the Chinese have still not specified when they will sign or ratify this treaty. Even more importantly, once ratified, the Chinese must implement this treaty, which will require major changes in domestic laws and policies. So, it will be a long process before this covenant translates into concrete change or greater freedom for the Chinese people. A mere non-binding verbal agreement to sign should not be trumpeted as a huge victory and certainly did not warrant dropping the Geneva resolution. 
That is what happened. Our Government, the administration, said to me that we are not going to go forward because the Chinese have agreed to sign this international convenant on civil and political rights. Several months have gone by. They haven't signed it. Even if they sign it, there is no evidence that they are necessarily going to implement a nonbinding international agreement, and it should not be a reason for having brought a resolution protesting their violation of human rights before the Geneva commission on civil rights. As my colleague Senator Biden said, `I don't agree with Senator Wellstone and others.' The presiding Chair might not as well, when it comes to linking human rights with trade policy. That is too blunt an instrument. But if there was ever a place to bring this up, it should have been at the human rights gathering; it should have been in Geneva. 
I am very happy that both my dear friend Wei Jingsheing and Wang Dan are in good health, safe and out of prison. However, we must be clear. These men were not released. They were forced into exile. Should either of them return to their homeland, they would be thrown into prison upon arrival. The Chinese government maintains a re-entry blacklist which contains the names of more than fifty Chinese citizens living in the U.S. Just last month two Chinese American democracy advocates were detained and deported upon their arrival in China. The forced exile of Wei and Wang does not represent systematic change. In early 1995 Wang wrote, `A society still needs idealists--people who are willing to sacrifice themselves to uphold the basic ideals of freedom and democracy.' 
I have to tell you that I don't know how they do it in these countries. I don't know how they do it. Maybe if it were I, myself, and I lived in a repressive country, I would speak out. Maybe I would have the courage to do it--maybe. But if I thought that my children, or my spouse, my loved ones, could also be rounded up, that they could be imprisoned, that they could be tortured, that they could be murdered--which is too often the case in too many countries; there are at least 70 countries that systematically practice torture in our world today--I don't know whether I could ever speak up. I think I would be afraid to, given what could happen to my loved ones. 
It is cruel irony that these brave men's exiles are being used as evidence of China's progress. 
Human rights advocates in China and around the world fear that the release of high profile dissidents could be used to justify a reduction in international pressure for systematic change in China, where according to the government's own count, some 2,000 people remain imprisoned for the crime of `counterrevolution,' now called `endangering state security.' Thousands more--political, labor, and religious dissidents--are serving terms of up to three years of `re-education through labor' without trial. The releases of Wei and Wang are clearly political calculations by the Chinese leadership, who have become adept at trading well-known prisoners in pre-summit diplomatic bargaining. Engaging the Chinese in this game of saving face and trading diplomatic favors sends out a message that we are not serious about human rights. 
For years before the world ever saw the televised massacre at Tiananmen Square, peaceful demonstrations in Lhasa have been crushed by the PLA. Once imprisoned Tibetans, particularly monks and nuns, face unimaginable torture at the hands of prison officials. Furthermore, the Chinese government's policy of forced migration of Han Chinese into Tibet has rendered Tibetans a minority in cities such as Lhasa, where they are marginalized and alienated. As the Chinese presence grows stronger, Tibet's unique culture faces the threat of extinction. 
The Tibetan people have remained steadfast in their commitment to the path of non-violence. However, some Tibetan exiles are growing impatient, as indicated by one man's recent death through self-immolation. In a desperate attempt to draw the attention of the international community to the worsening situation in Tibet, Thubten Ngodup, a 50-year-old Tibetan exile in Delhi, India, set himself on fire. 
In a recent meeting with President Jiang Zemin, Secretary Albright brought up the subject of Tibet and the American desire for a dialogue between Dalai Lama and the Chinese leadership. The Chinese sharply dismissed the Dali Lama and flat out refused to enter into negotiations in order to bring about a peaceful settlement to the Tibetan issue. 
The resolution I am submitting outlines concrete steps that would indicate a serious commitment to human rights concerns. In the context of the upcoming summit, we call upon the administration, at the highest level, to urge the Chinese leadership to revise their vague, draconian security laws, including provisions on `endangering state security' added to the criminal code in March 1997; to release unconditionally large numbers of imprisoned political, religious, and labor activists; and to review the sentences of more than 2,000 prisoners sentenced for `counterrevolutionary' activities, a crime that itself has been abolished. 
With regards to religious freedom, the Administration should encourage the Chinese leadership to abolish the requirement that all religious sites register with the official Religious Affairs Bureau; to lift government mandated quotas on the number of monks and nuns in monasteries and nunneries; and to immediately reinstate all monks and nuns expelled from their monasteries and nunneries for failing to denounce the Dalai Lama. 
This resolution also calls upon the administration to encourage the Chinese leadership to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama with the aim of establishing genuine cultural and religious autonomy in Tibet. 
Another concern is the symbolic significance of the President's official arrival ceremony which will take place in Tiananmen Square. We ask the President to make time in his schedule to meet with family members of at least one of the victims of the 1989 massacre, many of whom still suffer from political harassment, discrimination or persecution. We also ask the President to secure from the Chinese a pledge to get rid of the re-entry blacklist, which contains the names of more than fifty Chinese citizens living in the U.S. who cannot return to China. Allowing pro-democracy activists, journalists or labor organizers to return to China would be a significant gesture by the Chinese authority. Finally, until the Chinese leadership takes serious, concrete action on the concerns outlined above, we would strongly oppose lifting the trade sanctions imposed after the 1989 crackdown on demonstrators at Tiananmen Square. 
Some say that we cannot influence what happens in China, that the country is too proud, too large, and that changes take too long. I disagree. For years we have pressured the Chinese on human rights, and to let up now is tantamount to defeat for the cause of human justice. Dissidents who have been freed and come to the United States have thanked advocates for keeping them alive, by keeping the pressure on, and focusing attention on their plight. It is our duty and in the interest to make the extra effort required to promote freedom and democracy in China, and to bring it into compliance with international standards on human rights. 
Let me just make one other point. For years, before the world ever saw the televised massacre of Tiananmen Square, Peaceful demonstrations in Tibet have been crushed. Once imprisoned, Tibetans, particularly monks and nuns, face unimaginable torture at the hands of prison officials. Furthermore, the Chinese Government's forced migration of Han Chinese into Tibet has rendered the Tibetans a minority in their own country, and as the Chinese presence grows stronger an stronger, Tibet's unique culture basically faces extinction. So let me just be crystal clear. Whether it is in China or Tibet as well, we ought to be speaking up for human rights. 
Jiang Zemin, in a recent meeting with Secretary Albright, made it crystal clear when the subject of Tibet was brought up that the Chinese are not interested in sitting down in any negotiations with the Dalai Lama and are unwilling to bring about any kind of peaceful settlement to the Tibetan issue. 
So in this resolution, this is what we call upon the administration to do at the highest level: to urge the Chinese leadership to revise their vague, draconian security laws, including provisions on `endangering state security,' added to the Criminal Code in March of 1997; to urge the Chinese to release unconditionally a large number of imprisoned political, religious, and labor activists, and to review the sentences of more than 2,000 prisoners sentenced for `counterrevolutionary activities,' a crime that has been abolished. 
With regard to religious freedom, the administration should encourage the Chinese leadership to abolish the requirement that all religious sites be registered with the official Religious Affairs Bureau, to lift Government mandated quotas on the number of monks and nuns in monasteries and nunneries, and to immediately reinstate monks and nuns failing to denounce the Dalai Lama. 
This resolution also calls upon the administration to encourage the Chinese leadership to engage in meaningful dialog with the Dalai Lama with the aim of establishing genuine cultural and religious and political freedom and autonomy in Tibet. 
Another concern is the symbolic significance of the President's official arrival ceremony, which will take place in Tiananmen Square. We ask the President to make time in this schedule to meet with family members of at least one of the victims of the 1989 massacre, many of whom still suffer from political harassment, discrimination, and persecution. 
We also ask the President to secure from the Chinese a pledge to get rid of the reentry blacklist which contains the names of more than 50 Chinese citizens living in the United States who cannot return to China. Allowing prodemocracy journalists or labor organizers to return to China would be a significant gesture by the Chinese authority. Finally, until the Chinese leadership takes serious, concrete action on the concerns outlined above, we would strongly oppose lifting the trade sanctions imposed after the 1989 crackdown on demonstrators at Tiananmen Square. 
As a U.S. Senator, I cannot forget the courage of those students, cannot forget the murder of those students, and cannot forget their struggle then and their struggle now for democracy in their country. It took us a little time, but that is why I am really pleased that I believe our Government has really come out on the side of the students in Indonesia, and I think we are making a difference. 
Mr. President, some say that we cannot influence what happens in China; the country is too proud, too large, and the changes take too long. I disagree. For years, we pressured the Chinese on human rights, and to let up now is tantamount to defeat for the cause of human justice. Dissidents who have been freed and have come to the United States have thanked advocates for keeping them alive by keeping the pressure on, by focusing on their plight. It is our duty and it is in our interests to make the extra effort required to promote freedom and democracy in China and to bring it into compliance with international standards on human rights. 
Mr. President, there will be a great deal of activity this week that will be focusing on the President's upcoming visit, and I really hope that when Senator Durbin and Senator Leahy and I bring this resolution to the floor as a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, we will get a very strong vote. 
I really do believe, whether it is in China or whether it is in Indonesia or whether it is in North Korea or whether it is in a whole lot of countries, the former Burma, you name them, there simply has to be a way that we, as a nation, lead the way. There has to be a way that the United States of America can be there to support people. We cannot do everything. We don't directly intervene in all of these countries. But it saddens me that all too often we just simply turn our gaze away from people who are willing to almost stand alone to challenge repressive governments. We ought to be more on their side. We ought to be speaking out more about human rights. We ought to be speaking out more about the importance of democracy in other countries. 
I really believe that the President's visit to China will be a test case. If the President of the United States of America is going to go to Tiananmen Square--I wish he wouldn't. I wish he would not do so, but if he is going to visit, then he needs to visit with the families of those who gave their lives for freedom in that country. He needs to speak out about human rights. He needs to use the leverage of our country and the leadership of the United States of America to make a difference. We just can't say, well, markets, markets, markets; there will be all sorts of markets; we will make all kinds of money; it will be great for the business community. 
Great. I come from a State that is an export State. The Presiding Officer comes from a State where agriculture is very important. Agriculture is very important in Minnesota. I am really proud of agriculture. I am proud of the business sector in our State. But these are not mutually exclusive goals. I am not arguing that we are not interested in trade. I am not arguing that we don't look to future markets. But what I am saying is that it just makes me uneasy as an American citizen and it makes me uneasy as a Senator that we focus exclusively on commercial ties, exclusively on markets, exclusively on money to be made, all of which is fine up to the point where we just turn our gaze away from human rights violations, countries that systematically round up and imprison people because they speak out. That is wrong. That is wrong. That is not what our country is about. 
Since I have time to speak about human rights today, I will finish this way. All of us, I think, develop our viewpoints based upon our own life experience. I was a teacher for 20 years before having the opportunity to become a Senator, before the people of Minnesota gave me this chance, and I used to ask students to write on the same essay question at the end of every take-home paper, and the question was: Why do you think about what you think about politics? I never graded it. I just wanted them to think about what shaped their viewpoint--why do they care about some things and not others? Why do they consider themselves a liberal or conservative, whatever label you use? Was it their religion? Was it their family, mother or father? Was it some kind of powerful, crystallized experience where maybe--I remember one student wrote an essay and he talked about how his brother was born with disabilities, developmental disabilities, and that just completely changed his life and his family's life. Their whole view about whether or not maybe some people needed help, their whole view about health care policy changed on the basis of what he saw with his brother and his struggle and the struggles of his family. 
Well, for me, I don't come to the floor to try to make life difficult for our President. I don't come to the floor to criticize for the sake of criticizing. But my father, who is no longer alive, fled persecution in Russia, and the one thing that he talked about more than anything else was the importance of freedom and how much he loved our country. 
Well, I come from a background of an immigrant who fled persecution. I come from a background of an immigrant who fled persecution from Russia whose family was probably murdered by Stalin, who at age 17 left Russia and never saw his family again. 
I don't even know why I am talking about this on the floor of the Senate, but I think it applies somehow. At the very end of my dad's life he had Parkinson's disease, and we would spend the night with him. Sheila and I would rotate spending the night with him. Here he lived in the United States of America for 60 years and spoke perfect English, but all of his dreaming was in Russian. But it was not good dreams. It was shouting, it was torment, it was agony. As a son, I just cried. I didn't know what he was saying. I don't know the language. But I knew that this was anguish. 
What I always believed, and what I believe as I speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate today, is that this is what happens when you can never go back to your country, when you never can see your family again. Americans, thank God, don't have that experience too often. What does it mean when you can never go back and see your family again? What does it mean when you probably know, because you work for the U.S. Government, and my dad worked for the Voice of America, that your mother and father and sister were probably murdered? 
We should support human rights in other countries. We should be supporting human rights in China.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to explain my concerns about the conference report on the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). 
I want to first say that I was pleased to be able to vote for the Senate bill in March. This bill will continue the important work that was begun under the first ISTEA. It represents a comprehensive package to address all transportation needs. It continues the fundamental goal of the original ISTEA, which is to afford state and local governments greater flexibility in allocating transportation dollars. 
I believe that investing in our transportation infrastructure is essential if we are to remain economically competitive. Today, our highways and transit systems need continued support in order to meet our commercial and personal transportation requirements. 
I also want to thank all the people in Minnesota who have educated me along the way on transportation issues. In addition to the `traditional highway advocates'--the city, county and state officials, engineers and contractors--I have been working closely with community organizers, architects, preservationists, bicyclers and community activists. Though some may have questions about this or that provision, all of these people support ISTEA. 
ISTEA will guarantee that a federal investment will be made in maintaining and expanding Minnesota's highways, transit and other transportation related programs. I am pleased that several transit projects have been proposed in Minnesota, including the Twin Cities Transitway. Improving existing transit and building new transit will be crucial as we see our population in the state continue to grow. It is clear that, as our region continues to grow, we will need alternatives to the traditional car and driver commuting. 
Transportation is critical to our daily lives. We cannot separate how people and goods are transported from the many other parts of their social and economic lives. It is important to work together to ensure that we have a fully integrated, safe and environmentally sound intermodal transportation system in the State of Minnesota and the country. ISTEA does this through the MPO, ATP and STIP process. The planning provisions of the bill put the major decision-making back at the local level where it belongs. In addition, the conference report contains language that allows for appropriate meaningful public participation in the MPO process. While the MPO process has worked well, this new language will make the process that much more responsive to the communities that are most affected by their decisions. 
Unfortunately despite these facts, I cannot vote for this conference report for a number of reasons. First, the conferees have reportedly selected major offsets that I strongly oppose. While we do not have all the details, I believe the bill assumes $15.5 billion in savings from denial of compensation claims by veterans with smoking-related illnesses. The veterans health cuts are especially troubling. I believe it is an outrage that funding that could have gone to meet the many pressing needs of this country's veterans, will instead be used as an offset for spending in this bill. 
For years, veterans have been told that cuts to the Veterans Administration (VA)--and particularly cuts to veterans health care--were necessary to reduce the deficit and balance the budget. Last year's balanced budget agreement flatlined the VA budget over six years. It provided virtually no allowance for medical inflation, which in years past has come to roughly $500 million per year. 
But Congress can no longer pretend that its failure to provide for veterans' programs is a lack of resources. First of all, the budget is now balanced. Indeed, this year we have a projected surplus of somewhere in the range of $50 billion. Second, in this case Congress is taking resources away from veterans themselves. If Congress insists on denying benefits to veterans who were hooked on smoking during their military service, there is no excuse for transferring those savings outside the VA. 
I can think of a lot of areas in the veterans budget where we could have put those savings to good use. For example, I have a bill to provide compensation for veterans who were exposed to radiation during their military service. I've been told these atomic vets cannot be compensated because offsets would have to come from elsewhere in the VA budget. Yet this ISTEA bill seizes upon an enormous offset from that very VA budget and dedicates those funds to transportation. 
We could certainly provide more resources for veterans health care, which is facing a severe funding crisis. Without additional funding the VA health care system will `hit the wall,' VA Undersecretary for Health Dr. Kenneth Kizer has testified. 
This particular offset makes a mockery of the Senate's professed concern for veterans and for deficit reduction. I have real doubts about the various estimates of savings from denial of smoking-related claims. I know others do as well. Nobody knows how much VA will save by denying these benefits to veterans. But the conferees have apparently opted for the highest possible number. 
This offset makes very clear what some of us have long suspected. The reason veterans programs have been cut in recent years is not deficit reduction. It's not for the purpose of balancing the budget. It's not because full funding would require a tax increase. 
It's none of those things. It's because this Republican Congress places a lower priority on veterans than on other areas of the budget. We cannot get around that fact. Congress would rather use these savings elsewhere. 
Whether we like it or not, the legislation we pass in this body makes it very clear what our priorities are. I, for one, think we need to reorder those priorities. I think we need to put more emphasis on the needs of working families. And in this case, I think we need to put a lot more emphasis on veterans who have faithfully served their country. 
I will also vote no on this bill, as much as I believe in its goals, because of the way it attempts a resolution on an historic land use dispute in my State regarding the management of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, without adequate Congressional consideration or debate. Congressmen Bruce Vento and James Oberstar this week reached a last-minute, independent agreement on a proposal to change future management of the BWCAW. The proposed agreement would re-open two portages in the BWCAW to motorized transport in return for closing two small, pristine wilderness lakes to future motorized use. 
I regret that this agreement was reached in this way, at the last minute in the House-Senate conference committee, without having been debated by either the House of Senate. As I have said elsewhere, I would have preferred an open, fair, public Congressional debate on my legislation, patterned after Minnesota mediation proposals, and the major alternatives offered by my colleagues. I remain convinced that my compromise plan was a viable one which carefully balanced the interests of all parties. I do not think that last-minute private deals like this one are an appropriate way to conduct policy, especially on a major issue which has so divided our stated. Such deals do nothing to improve Minnesotans' confidence in the fairness of the legislative process. 
Mr. President, I want to reiterate my support for the overall objectives of this legislation. I believe investing in our transportation infrastructure is essential if we are to remain economically competitive. Today, our highways and transit systems need continued support in order to meet our commercial and personal transportation requirements. 
It is therefore with deep regret that I will be voting against this conference report. I believe that we could have done much better and produced a bill that continued federal support for transportation and transit infrastructure without the problems that this bill has created.

Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from Oklahoma, I appreciate his gracious personal remarks. I am proud to have his friendship. And the respect is mutual. The respect is mutual. 
Second of all, let me say to my colleague that I am pleased to find out that he did not say it exactly as it seemed to be reported in Roll Call. And I think his clarification is terribly important. I might not agree with his analogy, but I understand exactly what he is saying. And I think he has clarified the record. 
Third, let me just simply say to my colleague, and to other colleagues as well, that we have here a man, James Hormel, who has been nominated to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. Mr. Hormel comes to the U.S. Senate with enormous qualifications: dean of the students of the University of Chicago Law School, on the boards of such diverse groups as the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, Swarthmore College, a generous giver, committed to community, a dedicated public servant. Frankly, the list goes on and on. 
On May 23, 1997, a year ago, this very Senate unanimously confirmed him to serve as an alternative representative on the U.S. delegation to the 51st U.N. General Assembly. He has done a lot of marvelous work in human rights as well. 
Mr. President, the fact that there is an article in the paper that says that the President nominated Mr. Hormel and believes that this was important to the gay community does not in any way, shape, or form suggest that Mr. Hormel has a personal agenda. 
The fact that Mr. Hormel talked about a country that seems to have done a great job of moving away from discrimination against gays and lesbians as a very attractive country to him does not mean in any way, shape, or form that he would use this position to promote his own personal agenda. 
In fact, Jim Hormel has clearly and publicly stated that he would `not use the Office of the Ambassador to advocate any personal views.' 
Mr. President, I simply have to say to my colleagues there is a personal part to this and a political part. For the personal part, here is a letter to Senator Lott: 
I am writing to you to urge you to bring James C. Hormel's nomination as Ambassador to Luxembourg to a vote on the floor of the Senate. The stone-walling of this appointment reflects a flagrant disregard to all that we hold precious in a democratic society. If he is voted down then so be it, but not to allow due process to take place is clearly an indictment of the branch of our government that seems at times to be inclined to exhibit its own peculiar form of despotism. The President has nominated him and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has recommended him. Let the process take place. 
I am a sixty three year old retired counseling psychologist. I am the mother of six children and the step-mother of three. I have 17 grandchildren. Thirteen of those grandchildren I share with James Hormel. I have known Jim for 46 years and for ten of those years I was married to him. During those ten years we had five children. 
And she goes on to say,  
For many of those years he tried his hardest to live what was a lie. Of course, you might say I was the `injured party,' but I grew to understand the terrible prejudice and hatred that he knew he would have to face, that he has faced and is facing as he goes through the difficult process that this nomination and its opponents have put him through. James Hormel is my dear friend. I care deeply about him and have great admiration for his courage in being open about his homosexuality and his willingness to put himself on the line in accepting this nomination. 
James Hormel's former wife. 
Mr. President, let me simply say to my colleagues that this is really an outrage. I understand what my colleague from Oklahoma had to say, but I will have an amendment when we come back that I will put on the first bill I can after the tobacco bill, which will say that the Senate ought to bring this up. The majority leader, we owe it to him. 
Now, my colleague from Oklahoma has been clear on his position. I accept that. But I say to my colleagues that this man is eminently qualified. That is crystal clear, I think, to many of us, the majority of us. This man should be able to serve. And if, in fact, the reason he is being stopped--and this is what I fear; and I am not speaking to my colleague from Oklahoma--but if he is being stopped because of discrimination, because of the fact that he is gay, then let that come out on the Senate floor. Let us have the debate. And let's have colleagues come out here, no more holds, and speak directly to this nomination. 
If you oppose him, then oppose him on the floor of the Senate. My colleague from Oklahoma has been clear about his position, but let's have that debate. We owe James Hormel this. We owe the U.S. Senate this. 
This institution is on trial. If we don't bring this forward, I say to the majority leader, then I think we have to look at ourselves in the mirror. We need to bring this nomination forward. We need to have this debate. And we need to vote up or down. I believe elementary decency dictates that we do that. I will start having amendments on bills that will call on the majority leader to bring this nomination to the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we will vote on ISTEA today. I know a number of colleagues want a voice vote. I can feel the pressure building. We are about to leave. I say to colleagues, we are not going to voice vote the bill. We can't have a voice vote. This is an important piece of legislation, and a whole lot has happened in conference committee. Frankly, all of us should be on record voting nay or yea, yea or nay. 
For my own part, I want to talk about this piece of legislation. There are two points I want to make. This is a very important piece of legislation. I thank Minnesotans for all of 
their guidance. There is much about this legislation that I believe in, especially the important investment in infrastructure. I think it is a balanced approach. 
However, I will not vote for this bill, and I will not vote for this bill for two reasons. First of all, I won't vote for this bill because--we still don't know what the offsets are, but it looks like much of it comes from VA. I say that because I believe it is an outrage that the money that could have gone into veterans health care--and I could go on for hours about what the gaps are in veterans health care--will, instead, be used as an offset in this legislation. I also believe that too much of this spending will take the place of other discretionary, affecting the most vulnerable citizens in this country. 
The second reason that I cannot vote for this piece of legislation, as much as I believe in much of it, is the process. I think at the very end of this process there were several decisions made, one having to do with a sensitive environmental land dispute issue in Minnesota, the Boundary Waters, and I respectfully disagree with the way this is being done. 
I will not do any bashing on the floor of the Senate. I don't want to do that. But I will not support this piece of legislation, I want to go on record. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter printed from the Paralyzed Veterans of America. They say, `Don't Rob America's Veterans Again.'

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think they are right. There are too many veterans out on the streets that shouldn't be. There are too many veterans that are struggling with PTSD that are not treated. There are too many veterans that, as they get older, are not clear what care there will be. 
We have a flat-line budget that is not going to work for veterans. I think it is a big mistake to have taken this money out of what should have been an investment in veterans health care. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me join with my colleagues from Vermont and New Hampshire in supporting their amendment. I shall be very, very brief--uncharacteristically brief. I see the Presiding Officer smiling. 
Minnesota is a State that has played a very central role in this debate about tobacco. I think if there is one thing that has come out of the litigation, the whole case against tobacco with Minnesota leading the way, Attorney General Humphrey and others, it is this: Minnesota unearthed a lot of documents, around 36,000 documents, and many of the documents have been referred to in the debates on the floor of the Senate. The one thing that you see over and over again is a pattern of lying. 
It is just a pattern of outright lying on the part of this industry. Mr. President, I don't believe that an industry that has walked away from an agreement, which has really willfully targeted our children, has really caused a tremendous amount of pain among children and their families, has really brought about the addiction of children and too many citizens dying an early death, deserves any immunity at all. 
We should not give this industry any special deal. We don't in other cases. I don't think this industry should get immunity. I fully support this amendment. It is as simple as that. I see nothing in what this industry has done over many, many years--the way in which this industry has conducted itself, the way in which this industry has blatantly lied to people in this country, or, for that matter, the way this industry has related to what is going on here in the Senate--that would lead me to the conclusion that they deserve a special deal. I don't think people in the country think they deserve any special deal. 
Therefore, this amendment is extremely important. I hope colleagues will support it.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak one more time--and I have done this from time to time on the floor of the Senate--on behalf of the nomination of James C. Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. I have talked about Mr. Hormel's qualifications before, so I need not repeat that. 
We are talking about someone who is a loving and devoted father and grandfather, an accomplished businessman, dean of students at the University of Chicago Law School, on the board of directors of all sorts of organizations, from the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce to Swarthmore College--you name it. 
One of my colleagues--and I think it is extremely unfortunate--has compared Mr. Hormel, a highly qualified public servant and nominee, to Mr. David Duke who, among other credentials, is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, founded the National Association for the Advancement of White People, and claimed that the `Holocaust is primarily a historical hoax and not against Jews but perpetuated on Christians by Jews.' 
Mr. James Hormel has been compared with this man, David Duke. I want to say to my colleagues that, given this kind of statement made publicly by a U.S. Senator, this kind of character assassination, it is more important now than ever that this man, Mr. Hormel, be allowed to have his day in the court of the U.S. Senate. There is overwhelming support for his nomination. He should be brought to the floor of the Senate, and we should have an up-or-down vote. 
I want to just announce my intention to colleagues that when we come back, I will have sense-of-the-Senate amendments 
that the majority leader should bring this nomination to the floor of the U.S. Senate. When colleagues start making comparisons to David Duke to someone who has been such a sensitive, good public servant, that man or that woman--in this particular case, Mr. James Hormel--deserves, out of a sense of decency and fairness, to have his case brought before the U.S. Senate. I am going to be pushing very, very hard on this when we get back. 
I thank my colleague from Nebraska for his courtesy. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud co-sponsor of this Violence Against Women Act. I was a co-sponsor of the original Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and will work hard to see this Violence Against Women Act pass as well. As you well know my wife Sheila and I do a lot of work trying to reduce violence in homes. That is a big priority for us. And the passage of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act was a first big step and an historical occasion. 
It was the culmination of over twenty-five years of hard work by local and national organizations. It was an acknowledgment that this kind of violence within families is everybody's business. It was the public recognition that for all too many women the home, rather than being a safe place is a very dangerous place. And finally it sent a clear message that violence against women was a crime that would not be tolerated. It sent a clear message that we as a nation were committed to ending violence against women. At that time we thought we were introducing a comprehensive bill to end violence against women. We have learned a great deal since the passage of the first Act and with that knowledge we know we can and must do better. We have also learned that violence against women is multi-faceted problem that must be addressed in many ways. While the first Act provided important funding to improve services to abused women and improve the criminal justice system, the statistics show we must do more. In my own state of Minnesota, at least 17 women were killed in 1997 by their intimate partners. In that same year, over 4,000 women and over 5,000 children used domestic violence shelters in my state. I am sure that the provisions provided in VAWA allowed so many women to be served. I am sure that the provision in WAVA allowed law enforcement, in my state and across the country, to better address cases of domestic abuse. But now we must broaden our approach to this critical problem. 
And so today we introduce the Violence Against Women Act II. This legislation not only reauthorizes and improves the initial commitment set forth in VAWA, but also addresses the impact of violence against women in areas of child visitation, sexual assault prevention, insurance discrimination, as well as violence in the workplace and on campuses. The initiatives in this bill, as I'm sure my colleague Joe Biden will attest, were developed as part of a collaborative effort with researchers, advocates and service providers alike. Seeing the problems that victims face on a daily basis, they have helped us to develop legislation that will assist women who have been victims of violence. 
I have worked hard at addressing the severe economic consequences of domestic abuse on working women and am proud to say that VAWA II includes provisions to ensure access to family and medical leave coverage. With the passage of this Act women will be allowed to be absent from work so that they can deal with the domestic violence in their lives. Under this legislation victims of abuse could use family and medical leave to attend court hearings and go to appointments with health care providers. In addition this legislation specifies that unemployment compensation should be provided if employment is terminated due to domestic abuse. If a woman loses her job because of the abuse she is experiencing in her home then she will be assured access to unemployment compensation. In other words, this legislation addresses the fact that the cycle of violence will not be interrupted unless victims of abuse are assured of economic security and independence. 
Another facet of domestic violence that has been recognized since the passage of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act is the discrimination that victims of abuse face. I have worked hard at ending discrimination by insurance companies against victims of abuse and am proud to be able to say that this issue is well addressed in VAWA II. After years of work by advocates, encouraging women to come forward and report their abuse, we now find that they are being discriminated against based on their status as victims of that abuse. We all know that denying women access to insurance they need to foster their mobility out of an abusive situation must be stopped. Under this legislation insurance companies could no longer discriminate against victims of abuse in any line of insurance. 
And finally, I would just like to mention the provision to provide safe havens for children. It is time we address the danger that children and victims of abuse are subjected to during visitation sessions with former partners. Let us stop further violence from occurring by providing safe centers for children who are members of families in which violence is a problem. These centers will provide a safe environment in which children can visit with their parents without risk of being exposed to violence in the context of their family relationships. These centers will also save the lives of mothers by providing secure and supervised environments where they can drop off their children to visit with their abusers. Stopping the cycle of violence means providing safe places for women and children inside and outside the home. 
While we worked hard in the first Violence Against Women Act to make streets and homes safer for women by investing in law enforcement initiatives, we have learned that a woman's safety is dependent on her ability to achieve economic as well as physical security. The measures that I have mentioned are only some of the pieces that show the comprehensive nature of this bill. It is a reflection of what we have learned and the acknowledgment that we can and must do better. The Violence Against Women Act II is an impressive piece of legislation that deserves serious attention in this Congress. I look forward to the hearings and debates on this bill and look forward to working on and seeing it pass.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, when the Congress first conceived of comprehensive tobacco legislation, the primary goal was to deter youth smoking--I will say that again--the primary goal was, and is, to deter youth smoking. 
We have now discovered, through millions of documents--the State of Minnesota has led the way; my State, Minnesota, has led the way--that the industry has over the years intentionally marketed to our children, intentionally targeted our children. Our children, our sons and daughters--their profits. Our children's lives for their money. This is an unacceptable trade-off. 
Mr. President, do not take my words as a Senator from Minnesota as the final words on this matter. Let us just look at the tobacco companies' own documents. 
An R.J. Reynolds document penned in 1976: 
Evidence is now available to indicate that 14-18 year old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR-(tobacco) must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained in the long term. 
Philip Morris in 1981: 
Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens . . . The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris. 
The 1998 report, `Taking Action to Reduce Tobacco Use,' published by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded--and I quote-- 
. . . the single most direct and reliable method for reducing consumption is to increase the price of tobacco products, thus encouraging the cessation and reducing the level of initiation of tobacco use. 
And, colleagues, we can look at tobacco to see what effect raising prices has. 
Between 1979 and 1991, real prices in Canada increased from $2.09 to $5.42. And when that happened, the smoking usage among 15- to 19-year-olds fell from 42 percent to 16 percent. This is dramatic evidence; it is not a conjecture on my part. It is an important analysis. 
Now, colleagues, the tobacco industry has blitzed the Senate on this amendment. We have a second-degree amendment that doesn't want to do with any raise in price. And what are they saying? They are saying that this will bankrupt us. What are they saying? This will create a black market. 
But, Mr. President, Jeffrey Harris, who is a leading and impartial expert, talks about the tobacco industry making about $5 billion in profits in the year 2003. It does not sound like they are going to go under. 
And we can look at other countries--the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, and Finland--all of which have added on taxes to reduce usage, none of which has had a problem with this black market which we are supposed to be faced with. 
Mr. President, let me just simply say again what my colleague Senator Kennedy has said. The $1.10 tax that we now have, the $1.10 increase in the price--Senator McCain deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his leadership. But the fact of the matter is, if we had $1.10, we could decrease youth smoking by about 34 percent; that would be $1.10. If we went to $1.50, we could decrease youth smoking close to 56 percent. 
I say to my colleagues, even if the evidence is somewhat ambiguous, even if there are other studies suggesting that this might not happen, at least to this extent, what side do we want to err on? Do we want to err on the side of not jacking up the price and dramatically reducing the demand, especially among teenagers and young people, and getting to a 60 percent reduction? Or do we want to err on the side of not having the price high enough, combined with other smoking cessation programs that we need to put in effect, and continuing to see our children addicted, continuing to see our children take up smoking tobacco, and continuing to see our children die at an early age? 
Mr. President, let me conclude. Price increases will not bankrupt the industry. Price increases will not create a black market. What price increases will do is save lives. Let me repeat that one more time, because quite often what the tobacco industry has done over the years--I think my State of Minnesota has proven this through the documents that we have unearthed--is what they do is what they know how to do best, which is they simply lie and distort the truth. 
So let me be clear about what this amendment is about. Colleagues, the price increase in the Kennedy amendment will not bankrupt the industry. 
The price increase that the Kennedy amendment calls for, $1.50, will not create a black market. What this price increase will do is save lives. It is for the lives of all Americans, it is for the lives of young people that should not die a premature death, that I ask my colleagues to support Senator Kennedy's amendment. 
Yesterday, my colleague from Massachusetts pointed out that an additional 40-percent increase will mean that 750,000 more children will not start smoking--750,000 children that won't start smoking. This is about saving lives. This is, I think, perhaps the most important public health amendment that we have, because if we want to dramatically decrease demand and stop smoking among teenagers, we have to get the price up there to lessen the demand. This amendment does that. I ask all of my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Senator Hollings. 
Mr. President, here we go again. Now we find out that this bill covers not only prospective actions but it also has been expanded to cover, and thereby affect, four State settlements that have already been finalized in Mississippi, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota. 
We have been through this before in Minnesota. The tobacco industry challenged the State entering into a contingent fee with attorneys. They took this challenge to the trial court, to appellate court, and the Minnesota Supreme Court, and they lost every time. This amendment is another tobacco company amendment, and I believe they will lose again on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I have to respond to some of what I have heard my colleagues on the other side say about how these attorneys have done so little. That is a bitter irony, from the 
point of view of a Senator from the State of Minnesota. Minnesota, for instance, from August 1994, when the case commenced, until January 1998--we had numerous, unprecedented pretrial and discovery proceedings. Over 34 million pages of documents were reviewed. The majority of them had never been disclosed. The tobacco companies fought this over and over and over again on privilege claims. They lost. 
And the irony, I say to my colleague from South Carolina, is that much of what we know about all of the tobacco companies' tactics of misinformation and deceit come from those documents--from the State of Minnesota, from that case, from that settlement. It has a lot to do with the fact that people in the country want us to pass tough legislation. It has a lot to do with the fact that Minnesota led the way. 
What we are really talking about here is something very historic. These States went on a contingent fee basis with lawyers, took on the tobacco companies, and these settlements were historic because these were the first time that this tobacco industry had ever lost in court. Despite the long odds, Attorney General Humphrey and other attorneys general took on the industry, went with contingent fee, and the tobacco industry tried to stop it. They lost in Minnesota. And because of this work, with 34 million documents, additional information, a record of deceit and misinformation by this industry--that is what this debate is all about. 
This is not about anything other than making sure that when consumers want to take on a powerful industry like the tobacco industry, or the State of Minnesota wants to take on a powerful industry like the tobacco industry, they won't be able to do so. As a matter of fundamental fairness, this amendment should be defeated. I just have to simply say, I don't know where my colleague from Kentucky gets all of his arithmetic from--I am talking about Senator McConnell from Kentucky----

Mr. WELLSTONE. Not Senator Ford--dividing up how many lawyers worked on this and how much they got paid and all the rest of it. I never heard any of that before. 
Here is what I do know. It is true the State of Minnesota took on this industry. It is true the tobacco industry, just like some of my colleagues, don't want that to happen. It is true they challenged the contingency fee, just like my colleagues are trying to do here today on the floor of the Senate. 
But the tobacco industry lost in Minnesota in a case that went to the Supreme Court. Minnesota, working with lawyers and working with consumers, unearthed--what is it again; let me make sure I have the exact figure--34 million pages of documents. 
Mr. President, this amendment should be defeated. If it is adopted, it would be great for the tobacco industry, but it would not be great for the consumers and people we represent, and I think Minnesota is living proof of that. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I am very pleased we could agree on language in the managers' amendment which authorizes new demonstration programs for technology skills training for American workers, provided that funding for such training does not diminish funding for existing federal job training programs. It is important that job-training provisions of this bill are consistent with extremely significant legislation we recently passed overwhelmingly to improve the federal workforce education and training system. I thank my colleagues for working with me to achieve that end. 
Still, while many employers in this country are doing a great deal to educate and train technology workers, the clamor for a large increase in non-U.S. citizens to fill high-skill jobs here seems clearly to point to a lack both in those efforts and in our public job training system. Therefore I believe we also need to be sure that those who will benefit the most from any adjustment in immigrant policy will help us to address the underlying problem. We in the Senate cannot originate a revenue measure to fund the new training we authorize here. But it would be a serious mistake to enact a final bill that does not call on employers who have pushed for it and will benefit substantially from it to help pay for the new training authorized in the bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is little question that our country faces a skills shortage in industries with a concentration of workers who utilize high technology and information technologies. In Minnesota, we have very low unemployment in general, and Minnesota technology industry employers are having a hard time finding workers with the skills they need. The Minnesota Department of Economic Security released a study last week called `Beyond 2000: Information Technology Workers in Minnesota,' which indicated that over 60 percent of information-technology employers in the state believe the shortage of qualified information technology workers is `moderately' or `extremely' serious. Representatives of the Minnesota High Tech Council have been in touch with my office. They believe that the provisions of the Abraham bill which raise the cap on the number of nonimmigrant workers allowed to come temporarily to work in the United States are necessary. 
I agree that we want to make sure that immigration policy is consistent with our overall desire to remain the world's leader in high technology industries. The high tech sector is crucial in Minnesota. It is an engine of growth and a pillar of current very good economic performance by the state. I take seriously the argument that if the cap, which has been reached for this year, is not lifted, then a significant amount of U.S. high-tech business and a significant amount of jobs could actually be moved oversees. 
At the same time, however, there are three areas of concern that I believe must be resolved in the bill before it merits support. First is the matter of job training for workers who are U.S. citizens. Much of the debate over the bill is focused on high tech workers. Clearly we would hope that when we are talking about good jobs--jobs that require significant information technology skills and which pay well--then we are making every effort to see to it that U.S. workers have a shot at those jobs. That means training. 
As ranking member of the Labor Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I'm extremely pleased that we were able to complete and pass with an overwhelming vote recently a bill to reform the country's workforce training and education system. Still, even once that reform is enacted, following a conference with the House and passage of a conference report, I believe that the fact we are talking about a serious shortage of workers with technology skills indicates that our current federal job training system, even combined with the large amount of employer-sponsored education and training that is happening, remains inadequate. The skills shortage points to a failure in our efforts to educate and train. 
I had intended to offer an amendment to improve the Abraham bill in this area. I am pleased, though, that we were able to agree to changes in the bill which first of all authorize new demonstration programs for technology skills training for American workers. That provision is in a managers' amendment, which it is my understanding will be accepted. The provision ensures that funding for that new training will not diminish funding for existing federal job training programs. It therefore is consistent with the workforce education and training reform we passed with such a large vote. It is crucial that a bill which aims to address a skills shortage in industries that have good jobs available take every step to make sure that our own citizens ultimately can become qualified for those jobs. 
In my view, the new training authorized in the bill should be paid for largely with proceeds from a modest fee collected from employers for each application for the specialized visas. The Senate cannot technically originate a revenue measure to fund the new training we authorize here. But it is my hope that the House will include such a funding mechanism for new training of U.S. workers and that such a provision will be included in the conference bill. It would be a serious mistake to enact a bill that allows a large increase in the visas but does not call on those employers who will most benefit from the bill to help pay for the new training. I appreciate my colleagues' willingness to work with me on the provision that is included in the managers' amendment, and I appreciate as well the colloquy between Senators Abraham, Kennedy and myself indicating support from each of us for funding job training in this bill. 
Mr. President, I also strongly support both amendments offered by my colleague Senator Kennedy--one of the recruitment of U.S. workers for available high technology jobs and one regarding non-displacement of U.S. workers currently holding jobs in the information technology industry. They are moderate amendments and should be included in the bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as a long-time supporter of Israel and her security, and as a fierce advocate of the Middle East peace process, I commend President Clinton, Secretary Albright, Ambassador Ross, and Assistant Secretary Indyk for their ongoing efforts to preserve and even reinvigorate the stalled peace process. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, as a Jewish Senator, as someone who loves Israel, I have followed this latest round of negotiations carefully. I care fiercely about what happens. And I thank the administration for staying engaged and for making a commitment to a peace process that Prime Minister Rabin gave his life for. I will never forget my visit to Israel for his funeral service. It was so moving to hear his granddaughter speak about him. I really hope and pray that we will have a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. I think it will be important for the Israeli children and the Palestinian children, and the children of other Middle Eastern countries as well. 
I have watched with growing concern, over the past several weeks, as some critics of the administration's policy toward Israel here in the Congress have launched fierce partisan attacks on the policy. Speaker Gingrich last week was even quoted as saying, in a press conference in which he criticized the administration's recent handling of the peace process, `America's strong-arm tactics would send a clear signal to the supporters of terrorism that their murderous actions are an effective tool in forcing concessions from Israel.' 
Mr. President, I think that is a demagogic accusation leveled at the President. I believe that the administration is trying to do the right thing. I point out that public opinion polls show that the majority of the people in our country believe that the administration is doing the right thing by continuing to put proposals out there, by trying to get this peace process going. 
The administration has presented no ultimatums. It cannot force either party to do what it has no intention of doing. But I think this is courageous on the part of the administration. Quite often I am critical of this President, but I believe they are doing the right thing. The majority of the people in the country believe so, and the majority of the American-Jewish community, of which I am proud to be a member, also believe they are doing the right thing. 
President Netanyahu is meeting with Secretary Albright. It is my hope that they will have fruitful discussions. I think it is terribly important that this happen. 
Let me make three points by way of conclusion: First of all, the administration, as I mentioned a moment ago, is not issuing threats. However, the Bush administration--and I don't mean this as a partisan point, but the Bush administration in connection with policy on settlements did threaten to cut off aid to Israel. There have been no conditions of this kind, putting aside whether the Bush administration was right or wrong to do that. 
I also remind colleagues that this peace process is critically important, that it is important that we bridge the gaps, that the United States be a neutral mediator, that we continue to be a third party to which both parties can speak. 
Finally, I will simply say that all of us ought to contemplate for a moment what will happen if the administration does not press to preserve this process and if this peace process collapses. I think the alternative scenario, which I shudder to think about, would be an escalation of terrorist attacks, with Israel facing newly hostile Arab neighbors on all sides and increased pressure from the Arab street for violent action against her. It is frightening to consider. I don't think that stalemate or the status quo is acceptable--I believe it is unthinkable. I think it is terribly important the United States continues to show leadership in this process. 
Mr. President, this recent crisis in the peace negotiations coincides with Israel's celebration of her 50-year jubilee, an occasion of great joy for all of us who love Israel. 
With the founding of modern Israel, the children of Abraham and Sarah, survivors of over 2,000 years of persecution and exile, were home at last and they were free at last. But the dream of Israel's founder, David Ben-Gurion, and that of his allies was not simply to provide a safe haven from centuries of Jewish suffering, it was also about fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy of making Israel `a light unto the nations,' a powerful sign and symbol of justice and compassion to all people of the world. 
Although it is fitting to pause to celebrate what all the people of Israel have accomplished over the last 50 years, we must also look forward to the tasks which face her in the next millennium, chief among them the task of building a just, secure and lasting peace. 
It is my deepest prayer that our children and grandchildren, 50 years from this year, will be able to say with gratitude that we were the generation which overcame ancient hatreds and enabled them to achieve a just and lasting peace which has by then embraced the entire region and all the peoples. That is a vision worthy of Israel's founder and of all of us who come after. It is a vision for which we should and we must be willing to struggle, to fight for and for which all of us must take risks. 
I come to the floor to say that I do not believe there would be anything more important than to forge a just and lasting peace for the region. This would truly be worthy of the dream of Israel's founder. 
Mr. President, I speak out on the Middle East peace process, again, because I think there has been entirely too much personal attack and I believe it is terribly important that all of us who are committed to the peace process not be silent.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just point out to colleagues that six students were murdered by the Suharto regime. I came out on the floor 2 days ago and talked about the fact that this could happen. These students committed no crime except to courageously say there ought to be freedom in that country. They have had the courage to challenge this government and to speak up for freedom for citizens in Indonesia and for democracy, and to end the persecution against people. And for that, they now have been murdered. 
I believe that our Government ought to--we ought to use our maximum leverage with international institutions, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, to make it clear to Suharto that he does not get financial assistance when he murders his citizens. 
We ought to, as a government, speak up on this. We should not be silent. And we should support these courageous students in Indonesia. I want those students to know they have my full support as a Senator from Minnesota. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose S. 1260, the `Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997.' 
Mr. President, we are considering legislation that would risk imperiling the financial security of those individuals most susceptible to fraud. The American Association of Retired Persons opposes this legislation based on the bill's anti-investment character and the heightened dependence of senior citizens on investment. I find it very odd that in a time when the stock market is doing so well that some of my colleagues are considering exposing Social Security to the vagaries of the booms and busts of Wall Street, we are preventing the states from protecting their citizens from securities fraud. In a time when more Americans are relying on investments for financial security--especially retirees--we are rolling back protections. 
Many states, my own included, have laws which provide for increased penalties for fraud perpetrated against Seniors and the disabled--the Minnesota statute mentions securities specifically--and Congress has always given the states great leeway in protecting their consumers. In Minnesota, there is an additional civil penalty of $10,000 for each violation where deceptive trade practices, false advertising, or consumer fraud are perpetrated against elderly and disabled persons. 
Not only are seniors and the disabled at great risk for fraud, they are increasingly becoming investors and they are least able to recoup the income lost. It is devastating for anyone to lose their life savings through a lie, to have their pension wiped out, but for Americans on a fixed income--it will destroy them, Mr. President. 
I cannot support this legislation. It is bad for investors, it is terrible for seniors and the disabled, and it addresses a problem which does not exist at the expense of consumers. 
I urge its rejection.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Healthy Americans Act. Colleagues will be hearing more about it because there will be amendments that I will offer on this subject here on the floor of the Senate; and with every bit of ability I have as a Senator, I will push this piece of legislation here and talk about it in my State of Minnesota and around the country. 
The Healthy Americans Act insures the uninsured; guarantees affordable, comprehensive insurance for all, and ensures quality health care through its patient protection provisions. 
Let me start out by providing some context, Mr. President. I have two charts beside me to demonstrate my points. In 1987, we had about 32 million Americans who were uninsured. Today, as you can see from this graph beside me, we are up to close to 45 million Americans who are uninsured. Mr. President, since we debated the subject of universal health care coverage several years ago, a debate both of us were very involved in, we have had about a million more people a year who have been dropped from coverage. 
Assuming the same economic growth with no economic downturn, which is a very rosy assumption, we will continue to see this same kind of a profile where we will get up pretty close to 48 million Americans by the year 2005 who will have no health insurance coverage. 
So this is still a crisis for many Americans, and this is an issue that walks into the living rooms of many families and stares them in the face. 
The second chart shows the actual percent of annual family income, on average, that goes to premiums and out-of-pocket payments in the form of deductibles, copays or other amounts of money that people have to spend on health care. It is, I think, very important to look at this. 
First, what you see is that at the bottom end of the income ladder, families with annual incomes of $30,000 or less are spending an inordinate, and I would say unaffordable, percent of their income for their health care. If you look at families with incomes between $10,000 and $20,000, you can see they are spending on average 8 percent of their income on health care expenses. Then when you look at families with incomes under $10,000, you can see that the average family is paying well over 20 percent of their annual income, and these are the people who can least afford to make that kind of payment. 
Next, you can see that for families with annual incomes of $30,000 or more, the average amount of that income spent on premiums, deductibles and copays drops to below 5 percent on average--I would say a more affordable amount. But don't forget these are just averages. Many families at every income level are spending more than 10 percent of their family income on health care, especially if someone in the family has a serious illness. That is not affordable. That is not fair. 
Now if we look back at the same chart we can see what would happen under the Healthy Americans Act. All Americans would pay what they can afford--people should pay what they can afford--but it will be well within their means. For those hardest-pressed families, people would pay no more than 1/2 percent of their income. Those with higher incomes would pay no more than 3 or 5 percent; and no family, including those with at the highest income levels, would pay above 7 percent of their annual income for health care. 
So, Mr. President, as you can see, these two charts demonstrate the need to provide coverage for the uninsured and to make health care coverage affordable for all. 
The Healthy Americans Act does just that. First of all, it covers the uninsured, which I think is the first and most important thing to do. It builds, I say to my colleague from Indiana, on existing State programs. This is universal coverage with maximum flexibility. In addition to covering the uninsured, many of them moderate-income and low-income citizens, we are going to make sure that health care coverage is affordable for all citizens. 
In other words, we are going to have family protection. So, first, we cover the uninsured. Then we have family protection, and we say no family pays more than 7 percent of family income on health care, and it goes from about 0.5 percent to 7 percent depending on income. We include Medicare recipients as well. The income profile of elderly people is not that high and they need income protection, too. 
So, again, first, we cover the uninsured, expanding existing programs; second, we have protection for family income; 
third, we make sure there is a good package of benefits comparable to what we have here in the Congress; fourth of all, we have strong consumer protections, strong patient protections, something we have been talking about every day; fifth of all, we expand coverage to include some needed benefits that are long overdue. 
In Minnesota, and around the country--it could very well be the case in Indiana, Mr. President--a lot of elderly people are paying well over 30 percent of their monthly income just on prescription drug costs. We cover prescription drug costs and add that benefit to Medicare. We have good, strong mental health parity, and substance abuse coverage as well. And this is, I think, really important. 
The way all of this comes together for the States is to have a maximum amount of flexibility. And what we are essentially saying to States is, `Look, here is what we decided in the Senate. We are going to make sure the uninsured are covered. That is phase one. The second thing, we are going to make sure there is protection of family income. The third thing is we are going to make sure there is a good package of benefits, at least as good as what we have in the Congress. The fourth thing that we are going to do is make sure there is good, strong patient protection. If you agree to that, States, there will be Federal money that will go to you on a, roughly speaking, 70-30 matching basis. And you decide how you want to do it. In other words, the funds are there for you to use if you agree to lay out a plan for universal, affordable, comprehensive health care and follow it over the next 4 years. This is a good strategy for going into the next century; it is a good strategy for reaching universal coverage in our country.' We are offering the States a carrot; not a stick. 
No State has to do it. There is maximum flexibility. I say to my colleague from Indiana--we are friends even though we do not always agree on issues--we will not have this ideological debate about single payer or `pay or play' and all these other things that people do not understand. This piece of legislation, the Healthy Americans Act, leaves it up to the States. 
This legislation says to Minnesota, let us expand. We are already above 90 percent on the number insured in my State. Let us expand the coverage for these people who still have no insurance. Let us have some protection of family income, a very big issue for a lot of people who are covered but they are paying way more than they can afford, especially when you include the deductibles and copays and the premiums. 
What we are saying to Minnesota or Indiana or California or New York: Let us cover the uninsured. We can build on what you are already doing with the State Children's Health Insurance Plan, by expanding it to adults and more children. Let us make sure there is family income protection. Let us make sure there is patient protection and a good package of benefits that is comprehensive. And you decide how you want to do it. You decide how you want to do it in Indiana. You decide how you want to do it in Minnesota or California or New York or North Carolina or Florida or New Hampshire or Iowa--you name it. You decide how you want to do it. 
But the point is, if a State wants to participate--and I think most States will be very interested in participating in this piece of legislation--then there will be Federal grant money that will come on, roughly speaking, a 70-30 matching basis. 
Mr. President, I would like to talk a little bit about the cost of this, because I do not want to introduce a piece of legislation and treat people in the United States of America as if they do not have intelligence. If we think something is important, then we invest in it. This piece of legislation, as we have costed it out and done our actuarial estimates, goes like this: In the first year--we are just trying to cover the uninsured--it will be $42 billion; year two, it gets up to $48 billion; year three, $62 billion; years four and five--when we include both coverage for the uninsured and now also providing the family income 
protection, it gets up to $85 billion, and then, $98 billion. 
You would add an additional, roughly speaking, $26 billion to $39 billion to that estimate in the last 2 years if you are going to cover Medicare recipients, making sure they do not pay more than 7 percent of annual income for health care coverage and making sure that prescription drug costs are covered. Now, I say to colleagues, the maximum gets to be above $100 billion--we have estimated this to be $137 billion at the very end of this 5 year period. 
How do we pay for this? I will tell you. We have hundreds of billions of dollars of what many of us have called corporate welfare, a variety of different deductions and tax breaks, many of which I do not believe are necessary. In addition, we have some military weaponry that I think there is a very legitimate debate as to whether or not we need to be spending money on some of these items. And in addition, we take a look at some of the domestic programs that I think people can call into question as to whether or not they are essential. 
But, Mr. President, my point is that we offset the expenditure. We are not talking about taxpayers paying any more money. But what we are saying is that this is a worthwhile investment. We have a GDP of over $8 trillion, we have an economy at its peak performance, and we are being told that we cannot have universal health care coverage in the United States of America? We are being told that we cannot afford to make sure that every man, woman, and child has decent coverage? That there cannot be some protection of family income? That the uninsured can't be insured? That elderly people aren't able to get the care they need? That some patient protection for the people isn't possible? That is not acceptable. Of course it is possible. Of course we can do this. Of course we can do better as a nation. And that is what this piece of legislation says, Mr. President. 
I just say to colleagues again that I have been disappointed that we have put this issue of universal coverage off the table. It should be put back on the table. I have had so many conversations with people in Minnesota, poignant conversations--it happens in other parts of the country, too--which are about health care. I will just give but one example. I think I may have given it one time before on the floor. But, after all, the legislation we introduce is all about people's lives. Why else should we be here? It is all about, hopefully, improving people's lives. 
I will never forget a discussion with a woman whose husband I had met a year earlier. When I met him a year earlier, he was in bad shape. He is a young man, maybe 40 at most, a railroad worker struggling with cancer. And then I met her a year later out at a farm gathering, and she came up to me and she said, `I want you to come over and meet my husband again, Senator' or `Paul.' `He's a real fighter. The doctor said he only had 3 months to live, but it's a year later and he's still struggling. He's now in a wheelchair.' And so we talked. 
Then she took me aside, and she said, `Every day is a living hell. Every day I'm battling with these companies to find out what they're going to cover.' 
I do not think any American with a loved one who is struggling with an illness or a sickness should have to worry about whether or not there is going to be decent coverage. I think that is unacceptable. I think we can do better in America. I think it is time again to talk about humane, affordable, dignified health care for every man, woman, and child. That is what this Healthy Americans Act does. 
I love ideas. I am really interested in policy. I am proud of the people who have helped me on this legislation: Dr. John Gilman in my office; Rick Brown, who is with the UCLA School of Public Health; Doctors Nicole Lurie and Steve Miles from Minnesota. 
I like the fact that the Healthy Americans Act is a decentralized plan. I like that. I like the fact that it is simple. I like the fact that it gives States a lot of leeway, so different States can try different approaches, and we can see what works best. 
But we do have here, colleagues, a commitment as a nation to make sure those people who are uninsured have health insurance, to make sure families do not go broke and are able to afford health insurance, to make sure it is a package of benefits as good as what we have. Shouldn't the people we represent have as good health care coverage as Members of the Congress have, and shouldn't they be guaranteed strong patient protections? 
I think this is, in my not so humble opinion, an excellent piece of legislation. I think it is going to take a real battle to get it passed. But I will bring amendments out on the floor. I will do everything I can as a U.S. Senator to bring this to people in the country. I am absolutely convinced that this is one of the most important things we can do as a Senate to respond to a very real issue that affects the lives of so many people we represent.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will try to do this in 3 minutes. First of all, I say to my colleague from Texas, what he is now willing to do is hold up, delay, and potentially kill, crop insurance, which is extremely important to farmers in Minnesota and across the country, and research on alternative uses for agriculture products, crop disease, and research on scab disease in northwest Minnesota. 
He is willing to do this because he thinks there is some terrible wrong in this bill. I think it is a right. I think we are doing something that lives up to the very best in America. I say to my colleague and to people in the country, my colleague from Texas wants to hold this bill up because he finds it to be an offensive proposition that we should say that for legal immigrants we will make sure there is some assistance for those people who are elderly, disabled, and for small children. 
The Physicians for Human Rights released a report this past week finding an alarming amount of hunger and malnutrition among these legal immigrants. Food stuff use is on the rise. In the United States of America today at the peak of our economic performance we have people who are hungry and in jeopardy. What we ought to do here is restore some assistance for these legal immigrants. These asylees and refugees are people who have fled oppression in countries like Indonesia, China, you name it. They come to our country in the hope that we would be willing to extend a helping hand. 
My colleague from Texas talks about that as if it is a bad thing to do. I thought that is what we were about--people who fled persecution, people who were legal immigrants. Many of them were parents. My dad fled persecution from Russia. For the U.S. Senate to say, `Look, we want to correct the harshness. We want to make sure there is some assistance for you to make sure you don't go hungry if you are elderly, if you are disabled, if you are a small child, if you fled persecution from a country.' That is the right thing to do. Certainly we ought not to be holding up the agriculture research bill, which is so important to agriculture in our country and so important to farmers in Minnesota. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as a long-time strong supporter of Israel and her security, and a fierce advocate of the Middle East peace process, I want to commend President Clinton, Secretary Albright, Ambassador Ross and Assistant Secretary Indyk for their ongoing efforts to preserve, and even reinvigorate, the stalled peace process. I was encouraged to read this morning that President Clinton has asked Secretary Albright to forgo the G-7 meeting in Germany in order to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu while he is here this week in the United States. 
While they have come under fire recently, as a Member of the Foreign Relations Committee who has for years followed closely the peace process, I believe they should be supported in their efforts to help forge a just and lasting peace for the region by helping the parties to move forward urgently on the Israeli-Palestinian track. 
About a month ago 81 Senators joined in a letter to President Clinton expressing concern about the Administration's ideas for the next phase of redeployment being made public, about certain of Israel's security concerns, and about final status talks. I did not sign that letter, in part because I believe the Administration should be commended, not criticized, for sticking with this process at a critical time, and for its willingness to press for Israel's legitimate security concerns while recognizing the legitimate claims of the Palestinians. 
I have watched with growing concern over the past week or so as some critics of the Administration's policy toward Israel here in Congress have launched fierce, often partisan, attacks on that policy. The Speaker, late last week, was even quoted as saying, in a press conference in which he criticized the Administration's recent handling of the peace process, that `America's strong-arm tactics would send a clear signal to the supporters of terrorism that their murderous actions are an effective tool in forcing concessions from Israel.' 
That is, simply put, Mr. President, a scandalous and demagogic accusation to level at the President, who has been engaged for over a year, along with his senior foreign policy advisors, in a vigorous effort to bring the two sides together at a critical time in the peace process, and to help bridge the gaps that exist between them by offering constructive, creative ideas for each to consider. I understand that this proposal was crafted over many months, and was designed to address many of the Israeli government's most pressing security concerns and to meet many of its criteria for evaluating real progress on these issues. 
The President has repeatedly made clear that he is not trying to impose a solution on the parties, nor could he. And that he is not issuing ultimatums to anyone--as further evidenced by his willingness to have Secretary Albright reach out again to Mr. Netanyahu this week. After months of on-and-off negotiations, with U.S. envoys shuttling back and forth among the parties, the major points of disagreement have become clear, and President Clinton is now simply offering ideas for them to consider--an approach consistent with America's role at virtually every other critical point in the Middle East peace process over the years. At Camp David, in Madrid, and at subsequent major negotiations, American attempts to bridge the gaps between the parties have played a critical role in reaching final agreement. I have talked with senior American officials involved in the discussions, and remain hopeful that a final agreement will soon be reached. The parties must not miss this key opportunity to move forward in the peace process. 
Over the weekend Mr. Netanyahu rejected the Administration's offer, which Mr. Arafat had accepted, to come to Washington this week for a summit to agree on terms for a further withdrawal from the West Bank, and to agree to accelerate final status talks provided for in the Oslo Agreement. I understand from news reports that alternative proposals are now being considered by the Israeli government for a 13 percent withdrawal which could happen in two stages--a substantial withdrawal immediately, followed by an additional 2-4 percent withdrawal once Mr. Arafat makes good on certain tough new security commitments he has reportedly agreed to make as a part of the overall agreement. 
I understand these new arrangements include the kind of strong new Palestinian commitments to fight terrorism which the Israeli government has long been seeking, strengthening the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding negotiated at the end of last year, and providing for a test period before this phase of withdrawal is completed. That is a major victory for Israel, and should help to address legitimate Israeli concerns about the Palestinian Authority's commitment to fighting terrorism. 
Now I am not an expert, and I acknowledge that I do not know all the details of the various land parcels that are being discussed. But it is clear that on the issue of land, some progress is possible. Let us not forget that the Palestinians had originally sought a 30 percent withdrawal from the West Bank, as the first in a 3-phase withdrawal to which Israel agreed--though the timing and extent of each withdrawal were not explicitly established. So the Palestinians had sought a 30 percent withdrawal, the Israelis offered just under ten percent, and the Administration has been pressing for a compromise of 13 percent. Mr. Netanyahu has reportedly now privately agreed to a withdrawal of about 11 percent. 
I understand that Mr. Arafat has also agreed, as a condition for attending a Washington summit meeting with President Clinton and Mr. Arafat, to allow the next redeployment to be considered alongside final status talks, by a joint Palestinian-Israeli Committee, operating on a parallel track. The American proposal also reportedly contemplates greater flexibility on the Oslo timetable, which had been set to conclude by May 4, 1999. Each of these changes would be significant achievements for Israeli negotiators. 
Let me make four points about this situation, Mr. President. First, despite all of the recent (frequently partisan) criticism of the Administration, recent polls both here and in Israel show substantial support for further progress in the peace process. And this includes polls of Jewish Americans, of which I am proud to be one. Indeed, I read about a poll last week which noted that a substantial majority of Jewish Americans polled agreed that the U.S. in this process was doing just what we should be doing--offering ideas, facilitating discussions, working with the parties on alternative formulations which could meet all of their legitimate security and other interests. 
Second, let me remind my colleagues, especially those who have offered such fierce criticism of the Administration's efforts in recent days, of the need for a sense of proportion. Let me point out that the Administration is not threatening, as the Bush Administration did with settlement assistance, to cut off any kind of aid to Israel in this dispute. It is simply playing the role mediators should play in offering creative ideas, and allowing the parties to make their own decision about whether those ideas are acceptable to them. 
Third, let me commend the Administration on remaining engaged in the peace process, a process for which many Israelis--including most recently Prime Minister Rabin--have given their lives. President Clinton has been a strong friend of Israel, and the Administration is right to press the parties to come to a final agreement, to offer solutions which can bridge gaps, to ensure that proposals are on the table from a neutral mediator which one side could perhaps not accept from their adversary, but could accept from a third party. 
The administration has done so, I believe, because it knows that the success of these efforts is crucial to fulfilling longstanding American commitments to preserve the peace process, ensure Israel's security, enhance regional stability, and protect U.S. interests in the Middle East. Most urgently, the President recognizes that without a peaceful permanent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel's security--clearly a vital U.S. interest--can never be guaranteed. Let us not forget one thing in all of this, Mr. President: peace is the ultimate guarantor of Israel's security. 
Finally, let me ask my colleagues to contemplate what could happen if the Administration did not press to preserve this process, and it collapsed--as it almost surely would without such intervention. An alternative scenario, with the peace process in a shambles--an escalation in terrorist attacks, Israel facing newly hostile Arab neighbors on all sides, and increased pressure from the Arab street for violent action against her--is frightening to consider. 
Some here in Washington act as if the Israeli-Palestinian stalemate of the past fifteen months does not pose dangers for all sides. I think they are wrong. It poses very grave dangers to Israel, to the Palestinians, and to the whole region. That's why the President's approach of urging the parties to uphold their commitments, facilitating ongoing contacts and negotiations, helping each side understand the other's legitimate security and other needs, and presenting creative ideas intended to help bridge gaps between the parties, makes sense. 
Senator Feinstein observed on the floor last week that the Administration's attempts to facilitate an agreement between the parties efforts were `principled, worthy efforts . . . grounded in a deep commitment to Israel's security.' I agree with that assessment, and join her, Senator Lautenberg, and others in calling for restraint by my colleagues who have unfairly criticized the Administration during this difficult and sensitive time in the peace process. Of course, offering principled, thoughtful critiques of Administration foreign policy-making is a legitimate role of Congress, an important aspect of our system of checks and balances. But it is a right accompanied by a responsibility to be fair and informed. 
Mr. President, the recent crisis in the peace negotiations coincides with Israel's celebration of her 50-year jubilee, an occasion of great joy for all of us who love Israel. With the founding of modern Israel, the Children of Abraham and Sara, survivors of over 2000 years of persecution and exile, were home at last and free at last. But Israel's founder David Ben-Gurion's dream, and that of his allies, was not simply to provide a safe haven from centuries of Jewish suffering. It was also about fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy of making Israel `a light unto the nations,' a powerful sign and symbol of justice and compassion to all peoples of the world. 
Although it's fitting that we pause this year to celebrate all that the people of Israel have accomplished over these past 50 years, we must also look forward to the tasks which face her in the next millennium, chief among them the task of building a just, secure and lasting peace. It is my deepest prayer that our children and grandchildren, fifty years from this year, will be able to say with gratitude that we were the generation which overcame ancient hatreds, and enabled them to achieve a just and lasting peace which has by then embraced the entire region and all its peoples. That is a vision worthy of Israel's founder, and of all those who come after. It is a vision for which we should and must be willing to struggle, to fight for, for which all must continue to take risks. 
Prime Minister Netanyahu is coming to the U.S. this week, and will be meeting with Secretary Albright. I have heard from sources both in the Administration and in Israel that the Israeli government is actually close to reaching internal agreement on a variation of the Administration's proposed plan. I hope that is true, and that all the parties will reassess their positions in light of recent developments, and agree this week to take one more important step toward resolving this longstanding and bitter dispute, thereby helping to forge a just and lasting peace for the region worthy of Israel's founders' dream.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the context of my speech on the floor of the Senate today is as follows. I have been, as the Senator from Minnesota, moved by the courage of students in Indonesia who are challenging a very repressive government. They do this at great risk. But they have shown the courage to speak out. President Suharto has left for a conference in Egypt and has made it crystal clear that students and others in Indonesia who dare to speak out will suffer the consequences. 
The Suharto regime has been corrupt; it has been repressive. There are many reports by all of the reputable human rights organizations of people being arrested, tortured, raped, killed, or they have disappeared. It is in this environment that these young people in Indonesia now step forward with a tremendous amount of courage to speak for freedom and democracy in their country--Indonesia. 
It is for this reason that as a U.S. Senator I come to the floor of the Senate to support them. It is for this reason I have sent this letter to the President. It is my hope that our Government, and all of us here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, will make it clear to Mr. Suharto that we will not turn our gaze away from this repressive government, and that we will support these students and other citizens in Indonesia who speak out for the very things that make our country such a wonderful country--freedom, the right to be able to dissent, democracy. 
Mr. Pius Lustrilanang, a prominent opposition leader, was abducted earlier this year and was detained for 2 months. He talks about the ways in which his captors beat him, administered electric shocks to his hands and feet, in an attempt to discover details of his political activity. His political activities were political activities we take for granted. He was writing, speaking, and doing things people should be able to do in their countries. 
Student leaders of the People's Democratic Party, which was banned last September, have been arrested and sentenced to terms of up to 13 years. Students, young people--I say to pages who are here--your age, have been sentenced to 13 years in prison. What was their crime? They organized worker rallies, they called for a referendum on East Timor, and they were campaigning for a more open political system; in other words, for the right of people to be able to organize and to speak out. They now are faced with 13-year prison sentences. 
I am concerned about what is now happening in Indonesia. I think our Government should be stronger in our support of the students and for the men and women who are speaking up for democracy and human rights in Indonesia. I commend the Pentagon's recent decision to cancel a joint training exercise with the Indonesian military. But I am deeply troubled by reports that the United States may have been involved in training with the Indonesian special forces, which has really become or is known as a very brutal military unit responsible for the torture, the midnight raids, and the frequent disappearance of citizens. 
Mr. President, in addition in this letter that I have sent to President Clinton, I raise questions about the ways in which we bail out a regime which grows more repressive day by day. The infusion of capital by the IMF makes `economic' reform a condition for the bailout. I am not sure the IMF prescription has helped. I have said on the floor before that I am an internationalist. I think we ignore the world at our own peril. I think economic development support is critically important, as is humanitarian assistance. I sometimes think the IMF just pours fuel on the fire. In this particular case, the Government says it is raising fuel prices and taking other action like this in response to the IMF, which, of course, imposes additional pain and hardship on the poor, not on Suharto and his family. 
But, in any case, it seems to me that if we are truly concerned about the welfare of the Indonesian people, our continuing funding should be contingent upon greater political openness and improvement in Indonesia's human rights record. 
I don't know why the administration--President Clinton, the administration, our Government; really, the President speaks for our Government--I don't know why we are not more insistent on these governments who attack, torture, rape, and murder their citizens to abide by elementary standards of decency. In some kind of way, we should make some of our assistance contingent upon this. Surely we can at least speak up. Surely we can at least send a clear signal to the Suharto regime that we support democracy, that we support fair labor practices, that we support human rights, and that we will not stand by idly as this regime, the Suharto regime, continues to repress its citizens. 
I come to the floor of the Senate today to speak for the students. I come to the floor of the Senate today to call on the President to speak for the students, courageous students, courageous young people, who I believe are capturing the imagination of Indonesia. They are lighting a candle with their courage. And I think the President and I think the U.S. Congress and the United States of America ought to be on their side. 
I yield the floor.

This is very important to people. If you visit people in communities that have been devastated by tornadoes in our State, to be able to have forgiveness of interest on late payment of taxes is extremely important. It seems to be a little thing, but it is real important to people in our State. 
It has been a pleasure working with Senator Grams on this. I think we have done well. This will help people in our State. We thank all of our colleagues for their assistance.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my colleagues from North Dakota, Senator Conrad and Senator Dorgan, said it well moments ago when they were speaking about the Wall Street Journal piece that came out yesterday, Tuesday, May 5 regarding what has to be described as a farm crisis. In this piece, former Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland is quoted. Jim Tunheim, a State legislator from northwest Minnesota, is also quoted. 
I want to talk about what is happening in my State of Minnesota because I believe it will be incumbent upon all of us here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives as well to take some action. 
I was at a gathering in Crookston, MN some weeks ago. As I walked into the school, there was a sign posted outside that said, `Farm Crisis Meeting'. It brought back awful memories of the mid-1980s when I went to probably hundreds of farm crisis meetings. What I saw then all across Minnesota were foreclosures; people being driven off their farms where they not only lived but where they worked as well. I saw a lot of broken dreams and a lot of broken lives and a lot of broken families. This is now happening again. 
This very fine piece in the Wall Street Journal talks about this farm crisis in very personal terms. 
I want to say to colleagues that I know of no other way to say it. Some 2 years ago, when we passed what was called the Freedom to Farm bill, I called it then the Freedom to Fail bill. And I think that is exactly what is happening. All of the discussion about the market presupposes that we have Adam Smith's invisible hand in agriculture. But what we have instead is a food industry where the conglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table exercising raw economic power over farmers, consumers, taxpayers, and family farmers. Wheat farmers, corn growers and other farmers--vis-a-vis these large companies that they deal with don't have very much clout at all. 
This was a good bill for some of the big grain companies. There are only a few. But it was not a good bill for family farmers. 
Now, in northwest Minnesota, a combination of dealing with scab disease, wet weather over the last several years, and, most important of all, this Freedom to Farm bill, which has driven prices down, which doesn't give the farmers a loan rate to have some leverage in the market, which doesn't give them a safety net, is driving farmers off the land. 
We need to take some action. The Secretary of Agriculture supports lifting the cap on the loan rate. And we can legislatively try to raise that loan rate so that we can give farmers a price in the marketplace. 
I just want to say to my colleagues, I told you so. That is the way I will put it. I told you so. And northwest Minnesota is just a harbinger of what is going to happen across this country. Prices are low. Farmers are being driven off the land. There is a tremendous amount of economic pain. And it is not just the farmers. It is the communities where they live, where they go to church or to synagogue, where they buy their products, where they send their kids to school. 
We have a serious crisis in northwest Minnesota. I am hearing from farmers in other parts of my State as well. I think rural America is going to go through some economic convulsions as a result, in part, of this legislation that we passed. We have to give farmers a fair price in the marketplace. We secured them some loan funding in the disaster appropriations bill we passed last week, which gives them at least some loan assistance for spring operations. But it doesn't make that much difference long-term. It can keep them going for awhile, but if they don't get a decent price in the marketplace, they don't have a prayer. 
That is what this piece in the Wall Street Journal is about. That is why I come to the floor of the Senate. I look forward to working with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, who come from farm States. We have to do something. We are here to try to do well for people. We have to do better for family farmers in Minnesota and across our country. 
I thank my colleague from Texas again for his graciousness, and I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me speak about the same issue which my colleague has spoken about. As I talk to other Senators, I think we are going to hear the same thing that Senator Cleland from Georgia, I say to the chairman of the Finance Committee, was saying--that in his State it is the same issue. In my State of Minnesota, it is the same issue. I have essentially the same amendment that Senator Grams has. I think we can all join in one effort. That is the way it should be. What we are saying--and what my colleague said happened in St. Peter really put it best--I make this appeal to colleagues. This is just a matter of, I guess, just trying to help people out. People have enough on their minds. There has been such devastation. 
The last time around when we dealt with the devastation of the flooding in Minnesota and a number of other States, we were able to get not only an extension on the filings of the IRS tax forms but also, in addition, an extension on the actual payment. Along with that, we had congressional action which led to a forgiveness on the interest for late payments. But that did not automatically exempt. So this effort that a number of us have been working on is a terribly important amendment. 
I think both Senators from Minnesota and other Senators from other States who have been hit with these disasters just in the last several months this year would provide some help to people. That is what it is all about--providing help to people. It is my hope--in talking with other Senators and we had a discussion in the caucus at lunch as we look at whether or not it is a relevant amendment--it is certainly my belief this meets that test. This deals with a specific provision already in this bill that deals with the forbearance on interest payments and, therefore, I think it would meet the test of relevant amendments. I know that will be one of the questions that will be raised by my colleagues. 
I join in with Senator Grams and with Senators from other States, all of whom really feel we want to try to get this done, and we want to try to get this done on this bill. We will have a chance later on to come out here and speak about our amendments, although I think the floor amendments will essentially merge into one amendment. I make an appeal to colleagues--Democrats and Republicans, Republicans and Democrats alike--to please give us your support. This is very important to the people in our State. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Chairman Jeffords for his leadership. He had a lot to do with this piece of legislation. We did a lot of work on the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, but Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy were absolutely critical to bringing this piece of legislation finally to the floor and keeping all of us together. Senator DeWine--it was really a labor of love working with him. He has just put all of himself into this piece of legislation. He has done a great job. 
I would also like to thank a couple of other people: On Senator Kennedy's staff, Jeff Teitz, who is out on the floor with me today, for his work, and Brian Ahlberg who works with me and has put hundreds of hours into this, as have a number of other very talented people. 
I am not going to go into all of the specific provisions. I really want to take some time to thank some people who helped out. But let me just say, S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, is an important piece of legislation. The President correctly observed that the bill is `essential to widening the circle of opportunity for more Americans and keeping our economy growing steady and strong.' 
My concern all along has been that over the past couple of years there has been some discussion about cutting funding for job training programs. That would be the worst thing in the world for us to do. I think what we have now done, in a bipartisan way, is we brought people together around to job training that really takes root at the community level. We are talking about a program that is more streamlined. We decentralize it. There are accountable job performance measures, as there should be. The Governors have 
a key role to play, but they are in partnership with local communities. And at local levels of government, whether they be county or city, you have key decisionmakers as well. 
The private sector is an essential part of this, as should be the case, because a lot of these jobs that will be created will be in the private sector. We are talking about, you know, that goal that I think is the most important goal for most families in our country, which is to earn a decent living and to be able to raise your children successfully. This is all about doing that. 
In addition, we have kept separate funding for adults and youth and dislocated workers. We don't have a straight block grant program; we keep our priorities at the national level. I think we should do that. 
The out-of-school youth initiative is extremely important, targeting funds to youth in high-poverty areas, both urban and rural. Please colleagues--and I don't think too many colleagues make this mistake, but quite often when we talk about `youth' or `lack of jobs' or `young people dropping out of schools' or `inadequate housing' or `inadequate education' or `affordable child care' or `affordable health care,' we think about these issues as urban issues. These issues are every bit as important to rural America. The problems are more hidden but they are no less real. The nice thing about the out-of-school initiative is that it is already paid for. Congress has already provided $250 million in an advance appropriation. 
I want to take special note of the contribution of Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin, who testified at one of our subcommittee hearings. 
I want to also take note of our important national job training programs that we have renewed. The Job Corps Program, we have the Hubert H. Humphrey Job Corps Center in Saint Paul, which is one of the best performing centers in the country. Last year, we had Ralph DiBattista and Dave McKenzie, the current director--Ralph was a former director--at a hearing on youth training. They were joined by Susan Lees, who is an impressive young trainee at the center, on her way to becoming an auto technician at the Ford dealership. 
The bill also renews current Native American programs and migrant and seasonal farm worker programs. 
And finally the veterans program--I want to say to the veterans community, we heard from you loud and clear. You wanted to have a separate focus on veterans programs, a separate funding stream. We have some additional provisions by way of eligibility to make sure that gulf war veterans, some of whom are really struggling, will be well served; as well as homeless veterans. 
We have also built into this bill the continuation of Concentrated Employment Programs, rural CEPs. That is to say, in rural areas where there is high concentration of unemployment and poverty, we have a special focus to make sure the job training is out there. 
I think--and many colleagues have worked on this but I get to say it on the floor of the Senate, with some pride--this is a very Minnesota-like program. The one-stop centers, we have been doing that in our State. The idea of decentralization, of trying to build good partnerships between the Governor and the local community, trying to build good partnerships between the public and private sector with a focus on good job training, good skills development, and job opportunities for people. Job opportunities for people--I can't really think of anything more important for us to be focusing our attention on. 
So, I want to make it very clear that I am very, very proud of this piece of legislation. I thank my colleagues again--Senator DeWine, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Kennedy as well. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't see other Senators on the floor right now. I might just highlight some amendments to this piece of legislation, to make maximum use of time. 
There are five amendments to the bill which we have agreed to accept. The first is one by Mr. DeWine. It is the vocational rehabilitation bill. It is extremely important. I think what Senator DeWine has done is basically provided a set of improvements to this piece of legislation. 
It is an amendment that I strongly support. 
There is an amendment by Senator Lautenberg which gives units of local government which are currently service delivery areas under the Job Training Partnership Act, and which have a population of 200,000 or more, an automatic right to appeal to the Secretary of Labor a decision by a Governor not to continue that area as an SDA. That also is an amendment which I support. 
There are two other amendments by Senator Ashcroft which I will my colleague, the chairman, Senator Jeffords, to speak to if he chooses.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today with a little bit of sense of sadness to bring to my colleagues' attention the nomination--I guess I will add, and indignation--the nomination of James C. Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. As is the case too often up here, the nomination has been put on the shelf, held by a `hold' at the request of a few Senators. 
Before I talk about the reasons for the `hold,' I want to talk briefly about the history of the nomination and some facts about the nominee, Mr. Hormel, and his background. 
Last fall, following a hearing on his nomination, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 16 to 2 in favor of Mr. Hormel. This vote took place November 4, 1997. Originally, it was a voice vote. It was approved. That means by unanimous vote. Two Senators then requested to have a recorded vote and went on record in opposition. 
So it was a 16-2 vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is a very strong vote. 
The nomination was placed on the Executive Calendar. And despite the fact that the Senate confirmed every other Foreign Relations Committee nominee before the close of the first session--some 50 nominees in total--Jim Hormel's nomination was left languishing because of `holds' placed on it by a few Senators. 
Madam President, that such a distinguished and qualified nominee would face opposition is on its face hard to understand. 
Jim Hormel is first and foremost a loving and devoted father of five and a grandfather of 13. His entire family has been unfailingly supportive of his nomination. And people who know him well say he is decent, patient and a very gentle person. 
Madam President, I was very moved by a letter from Alice Turner, former wife of James Hormel, a letter written to the majority leader, Senator Lott, supporting her ex-husband's nomination. And I quote: 
I have known Jim for 46 years and for ten of those years I was married to him . . . I grew to understand the terrible prejudice and hatred that he knew he would have to face . . . and is facing as he goes through the difficult process this nomination and its opponents have put him through . . . I share with you these personal things because I gather his personal ethics have been questioned. If anyone on this earth could come close to judging that it would be me. He is a wonderful father, grandfather and friend . . . Jim Hormel has given enormously to his family, his community and to this country. He is just asking to be allowed to give one more time. This is a good man. Give him a chance. 
End of quote to Senator Lott. 
His professional credentials are equally impressive. He is an accomplished businessman. He serves as chairman of Equidex, an investment firm, and he serves as a member of the board of directors of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. 
He has also spent time as a lawyer and as an educator. He served as a dean and assistant dean of students at the University of Chicago Law School. In addition, he currently serves as a member of the board of members of his alma mater, Swarthmore College. 
Let me just give my colleagues a sampling of the kind of organizations he served on, impressive in its breadth as well as its diversity. In addition to his support for Swarthmore and the University of Chicago, he has provided resources and assistance to the Virginia Institute of Autism, Breast Cancer Action, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the American Indian College Fund, the United Negro College Fund, the NAACP, the Institute for International Education, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, Catholic Youth Organization, Jewish Family and Child Services, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco Ballet, and the San Francisco Symphony. 
Many of these organizations have honored him with awards. His commitment to public service and his commitment to the cause of human rights came together when he was named as a member of the United States delegation to the 51st U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1995. And there he helped the United States press its case for improved human rights in nations as diverse as China, Cuba, and Iraq. 
Finally, he was nominated in 1977 to serve as an 
alternative representative on the U.S. delegation to the 51st General Assembly. 
There is an irony because on May 23, 1997, the same U.S. Senate that opposes his nomination, not letting us have a vote, unanimously confirmed James Hormel to represent this country at the United Nations. 
Madam President, it seems clear to many of us why some Senators do not want to allow a vote on James Hormel's nomination. It is because James Hormel is gay. In a queer, unquestionable case of discrimination, these Senators refuse to let the full Senate vote on a qualified nominee because of his sexual orientation. Surely, the U.S. Senate does not want to be party to this kind of discrimination. 
James Hormel is exactly the kind of person who should be encouraged to engage in public service. He is intelligent, civic-minded, generous, and he is a person of proven accomplishment who wants to serve our country. We need people like him in public service. We cannot afford to drive him away because of his sexual orientation. 
So, Madam President, this is a matter of simple fairness. We have before us a qualified nominee, with broad support, approved by the committee of jurisdiction. We should at least be allowed a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. If people have concerns, let them express them. Let us have a debate, and let us address them, but let us give James Hormel a chance. Let us have a vote. 
So I call on the majority leader to schedule a vote on James Hormel's nomination. I call upon those who have a hold to allow the nomination to reach the floor. If other Senators wish, let us debate the qualifications. But it is wrong to prevent the Senate from having an up-or-down vote on this nomination. 
Some of the Senators who have holds on this nomination claim that it is not because he is gay. They claim it is because of his views on certain issues involving gay rights or something to that effect. The truth is, I do not know exactly what their objections are. 
But there is a more important truth. If Senators disagree with this nomination, let them come to the floor. Let us debate this out in the open. That is what the tradition of the U.S. Senate about deliberative action is all about. So I challenge my colleagues who have holds on this nomination to come to this very floor, explain why they believe James Hormel is unfit to become an American Ambassador because he happens to be gay. Let other Senators and the American people judge on the merits of this argument. 
The issue is a very simple one. We have a qualified nominee who was resoundingly approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He is entitled to a vote. And as a United States Senator, I am entitled to cast my vote for him. 
Madam President, I have language which would be a sense of the Senate to express the intention of the Senate to consider the nomination of James Hormel as United States Ambassador to Luxembourg, that the Senate would make clear its intention to consider this nomination before a certain date and to vote. I will not bring this amendment up on this bill. But this is an amendment that I will bring to the floor of the U.S. Senate on another bill. It is time for us to speak up. It is time for us to deal with what is an injustice. 
Mr. President, I will work with my colleagues from 
California, Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. And I will work with other colleagues as well. 
Let me just conclude by reading on this matter--and I say to my colleague from Arkansas, I have just one other matter in morning business to cover, and I shall be brief--from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, `Senate Should Be Allowed To Vote.' In an editorial calling for Republicans to let the Senate vote on James Hormel, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram writes:  
Conservatives, like Sens. Gordon Smith of Oregon and Orrin Hatch of Utah take him at his word and support his nomination. Some others, harking to conservative groups that are part of the GOP constituency, do not. Yet they say the issue is not his sexual orientation. If it is not, then the Senate should be allowed to vote, yea or nay. If sexual orientation actually is the issue, then the Senate needs to take a look at itself in the mirror. 
I repeat that. `If sexual orientation actually is the issue'--I say this to the majority leader. I call on the majority leader to bring this matter before the Senate for a vote. I quote the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the conclusion: 
If sexual orientation actually is the issue, then the Senate needs to take a look at itself in the mirror. 
We will not know until we have this nomination out on the floor. And we must do that. I hope the majority leader will take action. I have an amendment that I will bring to the floor if that is what is necessary. I think it is time for all of us to speak up. 
Madam President, I just have one other matter that I want to cover in morning business.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just briefly speak to one major public policy question that we will deal with in the U.S. Senate. I want to talk about something that has happened in the past couple of years which has had a major impact on the lives of people in Minnesota and across the country. I think people are scratching their head and trying to figure out when we had a referendum on this or when we voted. 
The topic is all the ways in which large insurance companies are dominating managed health care plans, all the ways the pendulum has swung so far in the other direction. Many citizens that need the care cannot get the care they needed. 
Jenna Johnson is only 15 years old. She suffers from cerebral palsy, seizures and a deteriorating condition called dystonia, which causes her to lose most of the muscle control in her body. She takes multiple prescription medications, undergoes countless hours of physical therapy, and relies on special medical equipment to live her life. Her treatments have nearly broken her body, colleagues, but her spirit and determination remain firmly intact. 
In the spring of 1966 Jenna's dystonia worsened. She was fragile from weight loss caused from the 22 pills she took daily to combat her symptoms. The medication caused serious side effects, ranging from damage to her stomach lining to psychotic episodes. The Johnsons found a specialist, a world-renowned pediatric surgeon in Pittsburgh that was an expert in treating conditions similar to Jenna's. He had the expertise in testing and surgery to place an internal pump and catheter to deliver medication. 
To make a long and very painful story short, this procedure was Jenna's only hope. She was slipping away before her parents' eyes. 
Minnesota is a great health care State. We have the University of Minnesota. We have the Mayo Clinic. Many people from other States--Delaware, Nebraska or Arkansas--quite often are referred to our State. But in this particular case, the expert that could help was a pediatric surgeon in Pittsburgh. The doctor was out of the plan and out of the State and the Johnsons were out of luck. 
The request for the procedure was immediately denied. After an appeals process of more than 30 days and countless visits to local doctors and letters to doctors in Pittsburgh and the HMO, the Johnson's plan finally allowed Jenna to undergo the procedure. 
It is wrong, Madam President, when a sick child and her family have to spend all of their time and energy fighting their health plan to get the care their child needs. 
Let me just simply say that, again, Jenna has had to struggle with the illness. Again, the Johnsons had to try to figure out how to get additional help. And again, after many appeals, the care was first denied and finally given care. 
I want to simply point out what has now happened is that the Johnsons have been switched to another HMO and they have been told that any additional care that Jenna might need will be denied outright. Any additional care this courageous 15-year-old young woman will need will be denied. They are out of luck. The Johnson's family is at their wit's end. Jenna's family has joined several HMOs and they can still not find one that will provide the most basic of medical needs without dealing with an overly burdensome corporate review. 
Now, let me just quote Jenna's mother, if I could, because I think this gets to what we are dealing with. Her mother, Cynthia, stated, `Why, at a time of crisis, is emergency medical care denied? . . . If my daughter should have another emergency, what will we do?' 
She feels vulnerable. She wants to get the care for her daughter, and because of the current situation in our country, she can't do it. 
Now, Madam President, the pendulum has swung way too far. We talked about containing costs. Fine. But where is the protection for consumers? What happens to families that are dealing with chronic illnesses? What happens to families that need specialty care? What happens to families who are trying to get the best possible care for their children? 
We have now moved to a system in our country which is increasingly corporatized and bureaucracized, where the bottom line has become the only line. We need to make sure that there is some protection for consumers. 
I think there are three issues, and I will summarize them: One, who gets to define `medical necessity?' It is outrageous that doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners and nurse assistants, who know what needs to be done in treating a child like Jenna, or an adult, today find themselves unable to provide the kind of care they thought they would be able to provide to people when they were in medical and nursing school. They should be making the decision. 
Secondly, it is just outrageous--we are talking about something called point-of-service option; people find themselves moved from one plan to another, from one year to another, and all of a sudden you have seen a doctor or have been to a clinic with your children and you are canceled out. You no longer have an option of being able to see a doctor or a clinic that has taken care of you and your children for a decade plus. All the trust, all the rapport, all of what makes for good medicine, goes out the window. 
Finally, we have to make sure that if we are going to pass a strong Patient Protection Act we have offices of consumer affairs in every State. They are independent with ombudsman that can be advocating for people. Family USA has done some fine work on this. It is not just an 800 number for people to call. People need to call a number, there needs to be an office that is there for consumers, where people can say, `I was denied care, what do I do,' and you have a skillful person that can be there as an advocate for people. 
I am saying to my colleagues, especially my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I don't know how many days we have left, probably fewer than 50 days or thereabouts. We have to get going on this. We have to get going on this. 
We have an important effort on the floor this week, bipartisan effort, which I think reflects some very fine work. But overall we have not been doing a lot. We have not been doing a lot about making sure there is good health care for people. We have not been doing a lot by way of being there for consumers. We have not been doing a lot by way of making sure that children come to school at age 5, kindergarten, knowing the alphabet, knowing colors, shapes and sizes, knowing how to spell their name, having been read to, and ready to learn. 
We have not been doing much by way of making sure that we move toward some system of universal health care coverage. There are over 40 million people that are uninsured. There are other families that are paying more than they should pay. There needs to be some income protection for them. What about a package of benefits for every citizen in the country comparable to what we have? What ever happened to the battle cry that we should pass legislation to make sure the people we serve have as good a health care as what we have? What about the strong patient protection? 
I have a bill called the Healthy Americans Act, which I am introducing this week, which is a strategy to move toward universal coverage and says to Arkansas, Nebraska or Minnesota, if you agree to the national framework, there will be Federal grant money available to you to reach universal coverage. You decide how you want to contain costs. You decide how you want to deliver the care. We have to move toward that system of care. 
We haven't done that. We are not there on health care. We are not there on investment in children and education. We are not there on strong consumer protection, and we are not there on a lot of issues that are very important to working families and communities. 
This issue of whether or not the U.S. Senate is on the side of big insurance companies or the consumers will be a litmus test for all of us. After we get done with this bill, let's get a lot of this substantive legislation on the floor. My hope is--and I will finish on this--that I won't have to have an amendment calling for a vote on James Hormel, but rather will bring that to the floor and make sure we do that as well.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from Nebraska. He has really led the way on this issue. He is well known for his outspokenness as a Senator, and he has been outspoken on this question long before the rest of us. 
I think we will pass this bill this week. I think it will be a very strong, bipartisan effort. Senator Kerrey mentioned Senator Grassley and Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, but on any one piece of legislation or any one issue, at least it is my view as a Senator, you need a Senator who is a catalyst, you need someone who is out there ahead of other people, who is willing to be very outspoken and push very hard. The Senator from Nebraska has done just that.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, let me just say to the authors of this legislation, and I thank them for their fine support, I will have one amendment that is terribly important to my State of Minnesota. 
Last year, we were hit by floods that had a devastating effect on our community. I think people all over the country know about Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and other communities. Last year, we said to people who were struggling because of what happened that we would extend the time for them to file their tax returns, and when they had to pay their taxes. We also were willing to forgive them on the interest they would have to pay for late filing and late payment. 
This time around, this past year, just a few months ago, we were hit with tornadoes that were just devastating to communities like Saint Peter and Le Center and a number of other different communities. I could list many. What we have now in the bill is the assurance from last year that Minnesotans who have been hit by tornadoes, communities that have been hit by tornadoes, can again extend the filing of their tax return and when they make their payments, but we don't have any provision that would allow them forgiveness on the interest. 
I will have an amendment that will give them forgiveness on the interest payment. It will be a huge help to people who have really been through it, colleagues. I think there will be strong support for this. What I will essentially say in this amendment, for the next year what we will do is for all citizens across the country, including Minnesotans who have been hit with these disasters, that they will, No. 1, have an extension again on the filing and payment of tax; and for those that have been personally affected--not everyone, because the cost runs up--but for those personally affected, they will again be forgiven the interest on this payment. 
It is not a huge expenditure. We will have an offset. I say to colleagues it is terribly important to a lot of people in Minnesota and I think a lot of people around the country. I hope this amendment will be approved. I think other colleagues will come to the floor with similar amendments. We can do this together, Democrats and Republicans, Republicans and Democrats. I am trying to make sure we get help to people.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased we are about to pass what may be one of the most significant and positive pieces of legislation to be enacted into law this Congress--S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. It is the outcome of an open, cooperative and bipartisan process beginning with a number of hearings on the subject last year in our Labor Subcommittee on Employment and Training. As soon as possible, following passage here, I hope we can proceed to a conference with members of the House and reconcile the differences between this bill and the one which that body passed last year. Some of those differences are substantial, but most are not fundamental. 
This major re-write of job training and workforce development law is vitally needed. If we can keep a conference bill close in most respects to this Senate bill, it will, upon enactment, represent an important step forward for the country's economy, workers and businesses. I agree with President Clinton's statement regarding this Senate bill, contained in a letter he wrote recently to the Majority Leader. The President correctly observed that the bill is `essential to widening the circle of opportunity for more Americans and keeping our economy growing steady and strong.' 
I would like to commend the Chairman of the full Committee, Senator Jeffords, as well as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training, Senator DeWine, for their leadership on the bill. Senator DeWine in particular has been tireless in pushing the process forward to make this bill happen. I commend my colleague for his work, as well as that of his staff. Likewise, I thank my friend and colleague, the Ranking Member of the full Labor Committee, Senator Kennedy, as well as his staff, for their work on this bill. It has been a formidable amount of labor. Department of Labor officials and staff also have provided an enormous amount of technical assistance. We appreciate their dedication. 
Arriving at this point has required compromise. As is usually the case with a bill of this magnitude, no senator or group with an interest in this key area of federal policy is likely to call our bill perfect. But the wide array of organizations and associations who support it are testimony to the fact that we have engaged in a very democratic process. We have endorsements of the bill from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, The National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of Private Industry Councils, the Society for Human Resource Management, the National Alliance of Business, the Business Round Table, the National League of Cities, the National Conference of State Legislators, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Job Corps Coalition, the American Vocational Association, the American Association of Community Colleges, and the National Association of State Directors of Vocational Technical Education, to name a few. It is a good bill, with widespread support. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will fundamentally improve our federal system of job training. It incorporates adult and vocational education without threatening those programs' separate funding streams. With the inclusion of Senator DeWine's amendment, it will also include reauthorization and improvement of vocational rehabilitation programs, again without threatening separate funding for vocational rehabilitation programs. 
The bill will help coordinate, streamline and decentralize our federal job training system. At the same time, it will make that system more accountable to real performance measures. It gives private sector employers--the people who have jobs to offer and who need workers with the right skills--a greater role in directing policy at the state and local level, which is where most decision-making power resides in this bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I agree with my friend's reading of section 367. Its demonstration and pilot project section clearly is meant to encourage projects to help develop and implement techniques, approaches and methods such as those the Senator informs us are contained in the proposal from his state for an engineering and training center. I would also certainly think that local private funding of 50 percent would qualify as `a substantial portion.'

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has been a pleasure working with my colleague from OHIO on this bill. I appreciate his extremely hard work. I would like to confirm my understanding of a provision of the bill and ensure it is the same as the understanding of my colleague. For purposes of programs authorized under Title III of the bill, that is, the Workforce Investment Activities title, housing is considered to be an eligible supportive service. That is specified in the bill's definition section. In Section 362 of Title III, the section dealing with migrant and seasonal farmworker programs, a range of workforce investment activities are authorized, including employment and training assistance. The section then also authorizes further related assistance for eligible migrant and seasonal farmworkers, including supportive services. 
For a number of years, the Labor Department has provided funding to a small number of single purpose grantees which provide an essential supportive service to farmworkers: improving their housing conditions. As S. 1186 defines supportive services to include housing and includes supportive services as eligible workforce investment related assistance for farmworkers, it seems clear to me that the bill would allow the Secretary to continue to make grants for farmworker housing.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me associate myself with the amendment earlier introduced by Senator Moynihan from New York. I have said before on the floor of the Senate--and I will say it again--the Senator from New York, I think, has said something very important with his amendment, which is that we should be using our prestige as a great country to really insist on membership to the EU for Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland. That is what is most important to enable them to reach their goals. 
Also, let me associate myself with the amendment of my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner. I think what he is saying in this amendment is: Colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, please go slowly. 
Mr. President, many of us had the opportunity to serve with Senator Nunn. I think more of us should talk about him and his wisdom. Senator Nunn raised three questions about NATO expansion. The first question is: Will this help us in easing or dealing with the whole problem of proliferation of weapons that might go to Third World countries--the kind of cooperation we need with Russia? The answer that Senator Nunn gives to that question is no. 
The second question Senator Nunn asked is: What about nuclear threats? Is this going to help us in terms of further arms agreement with Russia? Is this going to move the world away from reliance on nuclear weapons? The answer Senator Nunn gives is no. 
The third question that Senator Nunn raised is: What about reform within Russia? What about the forces for democracy? What are the democrats--with a small `d'--all trying to tell us? The answer, Senator Nunn says, is they are telling us with this NATO expansion, expanding the military alliance against a Soviet Union that no longer exists, against a military threat that no longer exists, is a huge step backward. 
Mr. President, I will conclude this way. Other colleagues are on the floor and want to speak. From Senator Sam Nunn to Senator Patrick Moynihan, to Senator John Warner, to George Kennan, to scholars like Howard Mendelbaum, to prophetic thinkers like George Kennan, and, more importantly, the forces for democracy in Russia, there has been an eloquent and powerful plea to all of us to understand that this could be a tragic mistake. 
Mr. President, I fear it will be a tragic mistake. I hope my colleagues will vote for Senator Moynihan's amendment. I hope they will vote for Senator Warner's amendments. I want to say one more time that I am in profound disagreement with NATO expansion. I think there will be fateful consequences. If we approve this, I hope and pray that I am wrong, but I have to speak for what I believe is right for my country and the world. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to NATO expansion. NATO expansion has been described by the distinguished foreign policy expert, Professor Ronald Steel, `as a bad idea whose time has come.' My fervent hope is that he's only half right in that it will turn out to be `a bad idea whose time hasn't come.' 
Why do I oppose the expansion of NATO? Two fundamental reasons. First because I've yet to hear a plausible case made for expanding NATO, which makes me think we are talking about a policy still in search of a justification. And second, because I believe it will sour our relations with Russia, promote internal changes within Russia harmful to U.S. interests, and may even imperil our own security and that of our allies. 
Since the two basic reasons for my opposition tend to be intertwined, I'll deal with them together rather than separately. 
Mr. President, I've yet to hear an explanation of why we should be expanding the NATO miliary alliance toward Russia's borders when there is no Russian military threat. The Russian military has collapsed. If there was any doubt about this, it should have been erased by the Russian army's inability to quell tiny, rag-tag Chechnyan forces. Even Polish sources have questioned Russia's capability to threaten its former Eastern Bloc allies in the foreseeable future. 
Moreover, arms control agreements signed between 1987 and 1993, pushed through by Presidents Reagan and Bush working with President Gorbachev, have helped to establish a new security structure that makes a surprise attack in Central Europe virtually impossible. The security situation in Central Europe is more stable than it has been at any time in this century. There is peace between states in Europe for the first time in centuries. 
Under these circumstances, why in heaven's name are we rushing to expand a military alliance into Central Europe? 
Secretary Albright has claimed that expanding NATO will produce an `undivided' Europe. I believe the Secretary is mistaken. What it will do is re-create a dividing line in Europe, only farther east than the original Cold War dividing line. President Clinton himself, before he decided to back NATO expansion, said that it would `draw a new line through Europe, just a little farther east.' He was right then and I am right now. 
Mr. President, since a Europe without dividing lines is vital if the continent is to be peaceful, prosperous and secure, why are we now considering a step that is sure to re-divide Europe? 
What would a re-divided Europe mean? Well, for one thing, the U.S. is committed to bringing the Baltic states into NATO if expansion proceeds. In my view this could have devastating consequences for world peace. In this connection, I recently read an outstanding piece entitled `NATO Expansion and the Baltic Iceberg' by Michael Mandelbaum, Professor of American Foreign Policy at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University and Director of the Project on East-West Relations of the Council on Foreign Relations. I have had the good fortune to meet with Professor Mandelbaum and I found him to be a perceptive critic of NATO expansion who views the issue through the lens of history. He succinctly describes the dilemma that would be created by the commitment to expanding NATO to the Baltic states. 
Professor Mandelbaum outlines three options: 
. . . the American government might try to expand NATO to the Baltic countries but fail because of Western European objections. . . . If on the other hand Washington did somehow prevail on the Western Europeans to admit the Balts, or failing that, offered them a unilateral alliance like the Japanese-American Security Treaty, the United States would be obliged to provide for their defense. This option surely require re-creating in some form the military deployments of the Cold War. American troops and American nuclear weapons would have to be stationed within the borders of the three countries. . . . Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia might well turn out to be defensible only with nuclear weapons, as West Berlin was during the Cold War, in which case NATO expansion would return the world to the hair trigger nuclear standoff of the 1950's and 1960's. 
Because of the determined opposition to Baltic membership the Western Europeans will mount, and the huge risks including the Balts will entail, the likeliest option for the United States is the third: Having agreed to defend three countries in Central Europe that are not remotely threatened, the United States will renege on its commitment to defend the Balts precisely because they might be threatened. This option would enshrine in the foreign policy of the United States the principle that American security guarantees are available only to those who don't need them . . . It would break a promise the Balts have received from the United States. . . . 
The damage to American interests that each of the three options would inflict would be infinitely greater than whatever modest embarrassment rejecting the NATO expansion that is now before the Senate would cause. And rejecting the plan is the only sure way to avoid the damage. Rejection, that is, is the only way to steer the American ship of state clear of the large menacing iceberg toward which the Clinton administration is now guiding it. 
I couldn't agree more.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the administration often claims its aim in expanding NATO is to foster democracy, stability, and economic reform in Central Europe. But there already is democracy, stability and economic reform in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. Besides, if this was our aim wouldn't the European Union, whose fundamental purpose is to spur growth and stability through integration, be a better vehicle for accomplishing these goals than NATO, which is after all a military alliance? If our goal is to expand markets and democracy, why don't we use our leverage to promote the expansion of the European Union? 
Central European states covet membership in the European Union for the economic benefits they believe it would confer. Wouldn't it be better for the United States to exert our leadership, our great influence, to promote expansion of the European Union which threatens no one rather than expand a military alliance that threatens the one country on which European security depends most? 
What worries me most though, Mr. President, is that NATO expansion, needlessly risks poisoning Russia's relations with the U.S. for years to come and increases the odds that Russian ultra-nationalists and anti-U.S. forces will gain power in the post-Yeltsin Period. NATO expansion threatens to turn the clock back to the worst days of the Cold War, something that few Americans and few Europeans want. 
Former Russian officials say and some former American officials confirm that by seeking to expand NATO, the U.S. is violating a commitment made when Moscow agreed to Germany's reunification and remaining in NATO, withdrawing Russian troops from Germany, and disbanding the Warsaw Pact. While there is some disagreement over what commitment was actually made to Gorbachev, there is no question that Russian officials say they had firm U.S. assurances that NATO would not be expanded. The Russian perception that we are reneging on our word can only erode trust and poison future relations. 
On this point, I will quote Susan Eisenhower, Chairman, The Center for Political and Strategic Studies, testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1998: 
It is Russian democrats who feel betrayed by NATO expansion--not the hard liners who are benefitting from it. Gorbachev says that we were verbally assured that NATO would not expand if the Soviet Union agreed to German unification and its place in NATO. Under the war-time Four Powers Act, Moscow had a legal right to refuse such an arrangement, and would have if the Soviets had imagined that less than a decade later some and eventually all of their former allies would be gazing at them from the other side of a military alliance. Russian hard liners, always deeply skeptical of Western intentions, say this `betrayal' is par for the course, and they mock the Russian democrats for trusting the West too much. 
Eisenhower, who met Gorbachev on a recent trip to Moscow, reported that Gorbachev was deeply disturbed by NATO Expansion's impact on those who promoted cooperation with the West, adding: 
`Russia has been swindled,' he asserted, and it is feeding into the wild ideas of those who hold `conspiracy theories' that the West is intent not only on the Soviet Union's demise but also Russia's. `NATO expansion has poisoned the atmosphere of trust,' he said. 
Mr. President, it is worth pointing out that the sense of betrayal isn't confined to former President Gorbachev, but is shared by our natural allies in today's Russia, political leaders who are committed both to democracy and U.S.-Russia cooperation. For example, there is Dr. Alexei Arbatov, deputy chairman of the Defense Committee of the Duma. Dr. Arbatov is a member of the leadership of Yabloko, Russia's largest unimpeachably democratic party, a strong advocate of U.S.-Russia cooperation, and a leader in the effort to ratify the START-II Treaty in the Duma. He was involved in the START-I negotiations in Geneva, and later served as a consultant on all the major Soviet-American and Russian-American arms control issues, including the START-II and CFE treaties. 
Here are Dr. Arbatov's thoughts on NATO expansion in light of Russia's agreement to German reunification and other concessions:  
. . . Nobody took the trouble to warn Russian that as a result of all these concessions and sacrifices, NATO--the most powerful military alliance in the world--would start moving towards Russian borders. To the contrary, Moscow was repeatedly told by the West that it would be accepted as an equal and genuine partner and that no major decision on international security would be made without it. Well the NATO summit in Madrid came as a clear manifestation that such decisions may and will be made and Russia's opinion really matters only so long as it is in line with the Western position . . . At best, NATO expansion to the East is regarded in Russia as a mistaken policy. . . . At worst it is regarded as the consummation of a `grand design' to encircle and isolate Russia, establishing strategic superiority and finally destroying Russia, ending once and for all Russia's role as a European power. 
If this is how a democrat and advocate of U.S.-Russian amity sees it, imagine how more conservative, more nationalist forces who could come to power in the future see it. 
Mr. President, am I missing something? Is there some compelling, over-riding reason that makes NATO expansion so vital to U.S. interests that we must imperil our relations with Russia for years to come and revive Russian mistrust and paranoia? If this is so, I would appreciate it if one of my colleagues or the Administration could tell me, and more important the American people, what that compelling, over-riding reason is. 
There is no question in my mind that colleagues who support NATO expansion do so because they believe it would be in the interests of the United States and think it would be the right thing to do. I question no colleage on that. But I am troubled by the fact that U.S. arms makers have played a major role in lobbying for NATO expansion. And this lobbying has been confined just to the United States. As difficult as it may be to believe, McDonnell Douglas helped the Hungarian Government win public support in a referendum on joining NATO by financing a CD-ROM game called `Natopoly' that was distributed free to libraries throughout Hungary. The Washington Post described it as a `piece of slick, unabashedly pro-NATO software.' 
Mr. President, U.S. arms makers seem to equate expanding NATO with expanding profits. To explain what I mean, let me quote from a June 29, 1997 New York Times article entitled, `Arms Makers See Bonanza in Selling NATO Expansion': 
At night, Bruce L. Jackson is president of the U.S. Committee to Expand NATO, giving intimate dinners for Senators and foreign officials. By day, he is director of strategic planning for Lockheed Martin Corporation. 
Mr. Jackson says he keeps his two identities separate, but his company and his lobbying group are fighting the same battle. Defense contractors are acting like globe-hopping diplomats to encourage the expansion of NATO, which will create a huge market for their wares. 
. . . `The stakes are high' for arms makers, said Joel L. Johnson, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association. . . . `Whoever gets in first will have a lock for the next quarter century.' The potential market for jets alone is $10 billion, he said. . . . `Then there's transport aircraft, utility helicopters, attack helicopters,' Mr. Johnson said--not to mention military communications systems, computers, radar, radios, and other tools of a modern fighting force. `Add these together, and we're talking real money,' he said. 
And the real `real money' he's talking about is more likely to come from the U.S. taxpayers than from new NATO members. In fact, it appears as if funds are already coming from the U.S. taxpayer to subsidize arms purchases by potential NATO members. 
Let me also draw from a study by William D. Hartung, the author of the report which is entitled Welfare for Weapons Dealers 1998: The Hidden Costs of NATO Expansion. 
I will read the summary of his key findings. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. Hartung wrote: 
Potential new members of NATO are the largest recipients of subsidized military loans from the U.S. Government: Allocations for potential NATO members now dominate the Pentagon's FMF loan program, representing 44.8 percent of the $540.1 million in FMF loans for fiscal year 1997 and 61.2 percent of the $647.5 million for fiscal year 1998. 
NATO expansion is good news for Boeing and Lockheed Martin, but is a potential disaster for U.S. taxpayers: Lockheed Martin has been promising `100 percent economic cooperation and up to 100 percent financing' for countries that buy F-16 fighters. Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Textron all have deals in the works to produce U.S.-designed weapons in East and Central Europe as an inducement to get officials there to `buy American'. . .The questionable terms on U.S. military loans to the region could leave U.S. taxpayers to pick up the tab for hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars in potential defaults. The likely result of all this furious marketing activity would be a U.S.-subsidized re-arming of East and Central Europe that will fatten the bottom line of U.S. weapon makers at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. 
Mr. President, if Mr. Hartung is right, and I think there is a good chance he is, NATO expansion will be a double whammy for U.S. taxpayers. They will wind up subsidizing U.S. arms merchants in a venture that will bring them less, not more, security. 
I now want to mention Senator Nunn, who I join in opposing NATO expansion. He deserves a great deal of credit for being the first Senator, to my knowledge, to raise fundamental questions about the wisdom of NATO expansion. Because of my enormous respect for Senator Nunn's knowledge of national security and defense issues, his concerns about NATO expansion influenced my own thinking. 
Senator Nunn delivered one of the most incisive statements I have ever heard on the issue when he appeared on the Jim Lehrer Newshour show in March of 1997. He addressed both the possible impact of NATO expansion on our national security and on Russia domestically. 
Here is what Senator Sam Nunn had to say: 
I'll start with the question, what are the greatest threats to the United States? Clearly, the No. 1 threat to the United States today is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, whether chemical or biological or nuclear. 
I agree with Senator Nunn, that should be the foundation of our foreign policy, our No. 1 concern. 
Then my question would be: Does NATO expansion help in the fight against proliferation of these weapons going to the third world rogue countries or terrorist groups? And my answer to that is no, it makes the cooperation that we have underway with Russia more difficult, perhaps not impossible, but more difficult. 
The second question I ask is about nuclear threats. Does NATO expansion help us in terms of easing the nuclear trigger, while Russia still has thousands and thousands of nuclear weapons, or is it harmful? And I think the answer to that is it makes it more difficult because it puts enormous pressure on the Russian military. They're extremely weak, conventionally now. They're not a threat to countries we're taking in, but their reaction is likely to be a reliance, a heavy reliance on nuclear weapons. So the answer that I have to both of those key questions relating to the threat is that it makes it--NATO expansion makes our security problems more difficult. 
The third question is the question of Russia itself. The greatest change we've had in the threat to the United States has been the breakup of the Warsaw Pact and movement towards democracy and market reform in Russia. That has a long way to go. But the question I ask, is NATO expansion going to make reform more likely in Russia or less likely? I think it makes it more difficult because it puts pressure on our friends, the democrats in Russia, and it gives a great political issue to the demagogues there and the people on the extreme left and the extreme right. 
I think my colleague, Senator Nunn, is absolutely right. It works at cross-purposes to stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I think it makes the nuclear threat more real, as Senator Nunn suggested, and it absolutely plays into the hands of the worst forces in Russia and to the disadvantage of democrats in Russia. 
Mr. President, the push for a larger NATO has already hurt our relations with Russia, as shown by the stalling of the START II agreements in the Duma, troubling frictions with Russia recently on issues ranging from U.S. policy toward Iraq, to proliferation issues, to the management of Russia's nuclear material. 
My colleague, Senator Moynihan, has had a distinguished career in diplomacy and international relations, and he was recently quoted as warning that extending the NATO alliance toward the frontier of Russia risks `the catastrophe of nuclear war.' I cannot honestly say whether I think his analysis is right or wrong, but I have to ask myself is there any compelling reason for the U.S. rush to expand NATO if there is the slightest chance that it could trigger a nuclear war down the road. Why are we taking such a chance? 
Dr. Arbatov, while in Washington last month to attend meetings at the Center for Political and Strategic Studies, took issue with those in the West who contend that Russians don't really care about NATO expansion. The following is a summary from his remarks that Arbatov approved:  
Contrary to what is being said by many Western proponents of NATO, Russians do care about NATO expansion, and they are almost unanimously opposed. It is true that most Russians, like most Americans, are primarily concerned about everyday things and making ends meet. But almost everyone who has any interest in foreign affairs is very concerned. Millions of pensioners who remember World War II, all the military, workers in defense industries, intellectuals, government and political elites care very deeply about this issue. And nearly the full spectrum of Russian politicians is opposed to the expansion of NATO. 
I want to conclude this way. Susan Eisenhower points out that not only are Russia's progressive forces being put under enormous pressure by NATO expansion, but there are signs Russian conservatives are already using it to their own advantage. Eisenhower stresses: 
There is already tangible evidence that NATO expansion has given conservative forces-- 
Which has a different meaning, I say to my conservative colleagues here, than conservativism in America. a platform. On January 23, the Duma overwhelmingly passed a resolution stating that NATO expansion is the `most serious military threat to our country since 1945.' It also said that Baltic membership in NATO would be incompatible with the NATO-Russian Founding Act . . . The resolution requested that the Yeltsin government devise a program to counteract NATO expansion. 
In pursuing NATO expansion, why is the administration disregarding the warnings of Russian democrats, George Kennan and other distinguished Russian scholars, that NATO expansion is likely to sow the seeds for the reemergence of antidemocratic and chauvinist trends in Russia? That is a serious threat, I say to my colleagues, to our lives, our children's lives, and our grandchildren's lives. 
I am especially puzzled by this since it must be evident to both supporters and foes of NATO expansion that European security and stability is greatly dependent on Russia's transition to democracy. A democratic Russia is unlikely to ever threaten its neighbors. 
Why then are we considering a step that will weaken Russia's democrats and strengthen ultra-nationalists who oppose democracy? George Kennan has said--George Kennan who wrote the famous Mr. X article in Foreign Affairs; George Kennan, perhaps the most prominent thinker about Russia in our country--George Kennan with the most distinguished career possible has said that expanding NATO `may be expected to inflame nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion [and] to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy. * * *' 
Let me repeat that quote. George Kennan has said that expanding NATO `may be expected to inflame nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion [and] to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy * * *' 
I urge my colleagues to carefully consider George Kennan's wise words, the heartfelt words of Russian democrats, and the prophetic words of Senator Sam Nunn and join me in opposing ratification of NATO expansion. 
Mr. President, I ask how much time I have left.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the 2 minutes I have remaining, I just want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that wonderful bishop in Guatemala, Juan Gerardi--a man of justice--who was assassinated on Sunday. He was the director and founder of the Human Rights Office of the Archdiocese of Guatemala. It has been absolutely devastating to the forces for democracy in Guatemala and to the forces for human rights. 
On the floor of the Senate today, I just want to say that I believe, as a Senator, that our Government should make it crystal clear to the Government in Guatemala that we want a full accounting. I urge the U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala to ask the Guatemalan government to swiftly investigate this crime; it is a terrible setback to the effort to shine a light into the dark corners of our hemisphere's history. 
What we know so far is that on Sunday, April 26, Bishop Gerardi was assaulted and killed as he entered his home. His attacker, whose identity is unknown, smashed the Bishop's head with such brutality that his features were obliterated and his body could only be identified by his ring. Nothing was stolen from Bishop Gerardi's body or his house, nor was his car stolen. 
When you have a courageous Catholic bishop who has been such a strong advocate for human rights murdered, we need to know--the people in Guatemala need to know--what happened. There needs to be accountability. 
Mr. President, this vicious crime is all the more terrible because of the context in which it occurred. On Friday, Bishop Gerardi had released the Archdiocese's report on past human rights violations in Guatemala entitled `Guatemala: Never Again.' He directed the Catholic Church's effort to gather information on the long, tragic history of massacres, killings, and torture in that country. These efforts are an important part of the people of Guatemala's efforts to come to terms with their past, through a full and accurate accounting of past human rights abuses. 
I do not prejudge this. I do not know who committed this brutal assassination. But like the Catholic Church in our country and like people all across the world who care so much about democracy and human rights, as a Senator, I do call on the Government of Guatemala to launch an immediate investigation into the murder of Bishop Gerardi, and to make sure that they bring this to closure and we find out who was responsible for this barbaric act. Whether or not this was a crime against a man who was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time or a carefully calculated attack against the Bishop and his work, the truth must be brought to light. Adding another mystery to the labyrinth of deaths, disappearances, and shattered lives in Guatemala would compound the tragedy of the loss of one of Latin America's great human rights leaders.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came to the floor because I had just come back and was in my office and I heard my colleague talk about the wisdom of George Kennan. I associate myself with his remarks. I have said on the floor before that my father was a Jewish immigrant who fled Russia. He had a chance to meet with George Kennan on a number of different occasions. He always marveled at Kennan's command of the language. My father also was always so respectful of his wisdom. 
George Kennan has argued that this could, indeed, be a fateful decision. I want to, first of all, ask Senator Moynihan whether or not he believes that we run the risk--I know he has talked about this--whether or not he believes that we run the risk of really poisoning relations with Russia and playing into the hands of the militaristic forces in Russia? Susan Eisenhower talks about a visit that she had with Gorbachev and that Gorbachev was deeply disturbed by NATO expansion. I quote what Gorbachev had to say to Susan Eisenhower. `Russia has been swindled,' he asserted, `and it is feeding into the wild ideas of those who hold `conspiracy' theories, that the West is intent not only on the Soviet Union's demise but also Russia's. NATO expansion has poisoned the atmosphere of trust.' 
I have two questions for my colleague. Do you believe that that is, indeed, the mistake that Kennan is talking about?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New York that--and I appreciate his historical perspective, because this is going to be a very important debate; this is a very important debate. We are going to be making a decision on the floor of the U.S. Senate that is going to crucially define the quality or lack of quality of lives of people throughout the world, because what happens in Russia is key to what happens in Europe and key to what happens with our children and our grandchildren. 
My colleague is absolutely right. Kerensky was a democrat, overturned and then the Bolsheviks came in, Lenin and the Bolsheviks. 
I say to my colleague, my father, who was almost 50 when I was born, came to this country. He fled czarist Russia. He was born in the Ukraine, Odessa, trying to stay one step ahead of the pogroms, where basically soldiers would come in and destroy my dad's dad's business because he was Jewish. My dad fled the country at the age of 17 in 1914, 3 years before the revolution. Then he was going to go back. He was excited because it looked like the czar had been overthrown and there would be democracy. Then his parents wrote him and said, `Don't come back, the Communists have taken over.' My father never saw his family again. 
When Sheila and I finally visited--I wish my dad could have gone back to Russia after the democracy forces were able to succeed--it was clear to me that all his family was murdered during the Stalin years. 
What has happened is that finally what we have is no longer a Soviet Union. We have the democracy forces and, I say to my colleague, Senator Moynihan, let's just talk about Dr. Arbatov, who was involved in the START I negotiations in Geneva and served as consultant through all the Russian-American arms control issues. You talked about your concern over the direction this takes us with the risk of nuclear war, including START II and the CFE treaties. Dr. Arbatov has said, and I will read the end of his quote: 
At best, NATO expansion to the east-- 
Right up to the border-- is regarded in Russia as a mistaken policy. At worst, it is regarded as the consummation of the `grand design' to encircle and isolate Russia, establishing strategic superiority and finally destroying Russia, ending once and for all Russia's role as a European power. 
Let me finish with this quote. Dr. Arbatov, by the way, is a leader of the democracy forces. That is what he is about. The people whom I talked with in Russia, the people whom I believe the American citizens are most committed to are the democracy forces. They are deathly afraid of what is about to happen if we adopt this agreement. 
Let me quote Dr. Arbatov again: 
NATO expansion will plant a permanent seed of mistrust between the United States and Russia. It will worsen everything from nuclear arms control to policies in Iraq and Iran. It will push Moscow into alliance with China and rogue regimes. 
I say to my colleague, yes, I think this undercuts the democracy forces, and it also undercuts a people who are proud of overthrowing communism and are now trying to build a market economy and build a democracy and who had no inkling whatsoever that what we would now do is expand what is a military alliance eastern right up to their border and redivide Europe. 
This is exactly the opposite of what they thought would happen. The European Union, that is where we should be using our leverage as a nation--expand the European Union. That is about markets, that is about democracy. But I fear that people in Russia feel betrayed by this, and I am even more frightened that the very forces that we do not want to see in power in a post-Yeltsin Russia--and there will be a post-Yeltsin Russia--will come into ascendancy as a result of this. This is a very, I think, serious mistake we are about to make. 
I ask my colleague this question. One American scholar has defined NATO expansion as `a bad idea whose time has come.' 
Can my colleague explain to me why this is--I think it is a bad idea. Why has its time come? Why are we doing this? In other words, we know what the risk is. We know that this is a real risk for democracy in Russia. We know that this is a real risk for arms agreements. We know this is a real risk in perhaps setting off just the opposite of what all of us hope for, which is the use of nuclear weapons, the unthinkable. We know what the risks are--poisoning relations with Russia, instability in Europe. So the question is, why are we doing this? Why are we expanding a military alliance? Is there a military threat?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleagues who are on the floor, I know other colleagues want to speak, and I am sensitive to your schedules. But I do think this is an important discussion and I never had the chance to do this in the 7 years I have been in the Senate. 
I said I really believe that George Kennan has made enormous contributions to the world. I think he is as profound a thinker and as knowledgeable a person about Russia as there is, and I put my colleague, Senator Moynihan, in the same tradition. 
There are other points that I will make later on in the debate I have other than what I have made today. I find it interesting. There was a piece in the New York Times, front page story, about all the ways in which some of the bigger companies, military contractor companies have now poured money into lobbying on behalf of this. 
That makes me nervous because I really do not want to see this become kind of a proliferation of weapons in some of the new member countries. And then what will be the Russians' response? I have concerns about that. Other Senators will talk about the cost, what will be the cost. 
But we are talking, I say to Senator Moynihan, about what I am most worried about, which I think it is a profound mistake, because I believe that, again, this needlessly risked poisoning relations with Russia in creating the very kind of instability we do not want to see. I think that we do not want to see the people who are prodemocracy forces undercut. 
But my question is this. You can help me out. I come from a State--I will tell you this is probably maybe the most difficult for me. Actually, the welfare vote was the most difficult for me on political grounds, but this may be the second most difficult vote, because I have met with some wonderful people--Czech community, Bulgarian community, Polish community, we have big populations in Minnesota. 
They have been wonderful supporters of me, I say to the Senator. They are really disappointed in me. And I wonder, what would you say to some pretty wonderful people in our country who feel so strongly that as a matter of kind of almost historical justice that these countries should have membership in NATO? How do you speak to their strongly held views, to how emotional--and I do not mean that in a negative way; I am not putting people down at all--they feel about this? How do you respond to them? What do you say based upon your knowledge, your experience in public service, your sense of history? Do you understand my question?

Mr. WELLSTONE. The U.S. Senate is about to pass a bill that deals with education and then send it to the President. 
Now, when I go back to Minnesota--and when I am in Minnesota I try to be in a school every 2 weeks--here are some of the questions that students might be asking me about this education bill. 
`Senator,' or `Paul,' will this legislation reduce the class 
size or the size of our classes so that our teachers will be able to give us more attention so we won't have to sit on a radiator because there is not enough room in the classroom?' By the way, I don't speak just for Minnesota but I speak for a lot of schools I visited in this country. My answer will be no, though I would like to be able to say to those students yes, because I know how important class size is to whether or not they receive a good education. 
`Senator, will there be any money to renovate our school?' I was just meeting with a group of students from one of our schools, a middle school in Minnesota, the community of Cambridge. They were talking about some of the problems that they have. `Senator, will there be any money to rebuild our schools?' 
Or as I think about some of the schools I visited around the country, and if I was talking to other children, they might be saying to me, `Senator, the roofs are caving in, the building is decrepit, the air-conditioning doesn't work during the warm spring months, the heating system doesn't work well during the cold weather months. Is there any money to invest in the infrastructure, because we don't have the wealth in our communities to do this?' My answer will be, `No, not in this piece of legislation.' 
`Senator, will this bill train teachers to use technology so they can incorporate that into their teaching--because we are hearing that it is so important for us to be technologically literate to compete in the economy. Will that happen?' And my answer will be no. 
How about other people who work with children, people who are down in the trenches? This is their life's work. This is their passion. They say to me, `Senator, did you in this education bill put any money into early childhood development so that when children reach kindergarten they will be ready to learn?' And the answer will be no. 
Then another question will come: `Senator, what about after-school care?' I think about the Boxer amendment. `Did you put any money into good community-based after-school care programs?' A lot of us with teenage daughters and sons worry a lot about where they are and whether or not there would be something positive for them to do after school. `Did you all do anything in this legislation to help us?' And the answer will be no. 
Then to make matters worse, with some of the amendments that have passed, I heard my colleague from California speaking, now we have block grant amendments that passed. So as a national community, what we used to say was we are a nation. We do not want to grow apart, we want to grow together. We make certain commitments here in the Senate and here in the House of Representatives representing our Nation. We are a national community with certain values and priorities. By golly, one of them is title I. We want to make sure that children who come from families in difficult circumstances--low and moderate income and other problems--get some additional support, and our schools get some additional support so they can give these kids some additional help. 
Now there is no assurance that will happen. There is no assurance that we will have the same commitment to safe and drug-free schools. We now have with this piece of legislation $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion--what we have done is not just a money issue. It is not just a lack of investment in crumbling schools. That is not there. It is not just the lack of investment in smaller class sizes. It is not there. It is not the lack of investment in enabling teachers to get more training for uses in technology. It is not there. It is not just a great step backward where we don't invest the money in public education. 
I don't know what slice of the population we are talking about, but I will tell you there are not a lot of Minnesotans who can just take $2,000 and put it into savings. What about the vast majority of people who don't have those dollars, who are concerned about the communities they live in and the schools their children go to, public education? 
This isn't a great step forward for public education or education for children; this is a great leap backward. Now we have done something else, I say to my colleagues who supported this initial framework. What we have done through amendments passed on this floor is undercut what has been a historic national community commitment to title I, to children who need that additional help. This is not a step forward; this is a great leap backward. 
Mr. President, I will tell you, this piece of legislation is a piece of legislation that does not do well for many, many children in our country. We should be able to do much better. If we were to think about the best kinds of things we could do to make sure that children would do well, that we could have good education for all of our children, we would have put a lot of emphasis on smaller class size, and there is no emphasis on it; a lot of emphasis on early childhood development, and there is no emphasis on this; a lot of emphasis on after-school programs, and there is nothing in this legislation; a lot of emphasis on rebuilding crumbling schools. 
What kind of message do you think these children get when they walk into these dilapidated buildings? The message is that we don't value them. But there is nothing in this legislation that deals with that. Mr. President, what we also would have done is, we would have focused not just on the children, but we should be focusing also on the parent or parents. The two most important explanatory variables in determining how well children do are the income status and the educational status of their parent or parents. We don't put the emphasis on that. We don't put the emphasis on making sure there is health care there and good jobs and family income. We don't put the emphasis on smaller class size. We don't put emphasis on rebuilding crumbling schools. We don't put emphasis on preschool, early childhood development or after-school programs. What we do is undercut and wipe away a major commitment that we have made to the title I program and funds for kids from low- and moderate-income families. 
This piece of legislation is not a great step forward; it is a great leap backward from a commitment to public education, from a commitment to children and families all across the United States of America, from a national commitment to making sure that we expand opportunities for all of the children in our country. 
This piece of legislation doesn't do that. It may pass, but it will be vetoed by the President. And I will say to my colleagues that I am sorry, because I guess, with the exception of some Senators who have a different view, this is by and large a difference that we have on the two sides of the aisle. I look forward to this national debate. We will be debating education. In a way, this exercise--I would not call it meaningless. People spoke. But the truth of the matter is that everybody knows the President is going to veto this bill. He has made that clear. In that sense, all of us have felt a little uneasy about this week. But the debate will go on, because this issue of education, this issue of our children, whether our children will get good educational opportunities so they will do well in their lives--this is an important issue to families in North Dakota, Connecticut, Minnesota, and all across the country. 
As a Democrat, I am telling you, we are going to take this issue out and about the country. We are going to have a discussion, dialog, and debate. This piece of legislation, especially with these amendments, represents a huge step backward, and I want people in the country to understand that on this issue, the differences between the Democrats and Republicans makes a huge difference. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that I will try to be relatively brief. 
I wish to speak to the agreement that the Senator from Georgia had announced. Senator Gregg had an amendment that he wanted to bring to the floor dealing with IDEA. Many of us were concerned about his amendment. From my point of view, this was an amendment that I believe threatened to undercut some of what I think has really been rich and important about IDEA. 
That is my own view. Many people in the disabilities community, many parents of children are worried about it as well. IDEA is really a pretty wonderful breakthrough for many families because up until the mid seventies--I know Senator Harkin will speak about this later--there were about 8 or 9 million children, many of whom felt shut out from the schools. The concern we had was that this amendment might turn the clock back. We did not want that to happen. It was our view it wasn't a question of it might turn the clock back; we were worried that it would. I guess the agreement we have reached is that now Senator Gregg is going to withdraw the amendment. 
I now want to speak about the amendment I am withdrawing. I want to say to parents and people in the disabilities community, especially in my State of Minnesota, that I have withdrawn this amendment reluctantly, but I understand their concern, and people really kind of got to my heart because there was a tremendous amount of concern about this amendment and I care fiercely about IDEA. I thought last year we had reached a good bipartisan consensus. I think this amendment by Senator Gregg is mistaken. I am glad it is now withdrawn. And when Senator Harkin--who is one of my really close friends here, somebody whom I have a tremendous amount of respect for and who has been probably, I think, just a giant in the Senate when it comes to issues that affect the disabilities community--said that he thought this agreement would put his mind at ease, then I so agreed. 
Mr. President, I will therefore offer the amendment that I had initially had to the Coverdell bill to the higher education bill, which makes a great deal of sense because that is really what this is about. I think we can get a majority vote for this because this amendment is very reasonable. Some Senators, such as Senator Ford from Kentucky, Senator Levin from Michigan, Senator Durbin from Illinois, who are among the original cosponsors, voted for the welfare bill. I voted against the welfare bill, but that is not what this amendment is about. What this amendment says is that we really have to fix the welfare bill. We have to make a modification here because what's happening around the country is that too many States are put in a position, in order to meet the work participation requirements, of essentially saying to single parents, almost all of them women with small children, you have to leave school and take a job even if that job is maybe a $6-an-hour job, and then a year later they will be worse off because they don't receive any health care benefits. 
This is shortsighted, and I do not think anybody intended this to happen. What this amendment will say, I say to my colleague from Georgia, is it will leave it up to States. There is no mandate at all. It will just say that if the State of Minnesota--and I think my State certainly wants to do this, or the State of Georgia or the State of Kentucky so decides--the States can say to us, `Look, we would like to be able to give these parents, these women, 2 years of higher education because they are on the path to economic self-sufficiency.' Why would you want to take them off that path? 
These are the parents who have the best chance of completing at least 2 years of school and then obtaining a living wage job and doing better for themselves and their children, and that this would not count against the work force participation requirements that States now have to meet. It would leave it entirely up to the States, but it would at least give States that option. 
I think my colleagues will be hearing from a lot of Governors and a lot of States and the higher education community. I think it makes all the sense in the world. 
This surely is not what we intended. I do not think we intended, under the framework of what is called welfare reform, to put States in a position where States have to say to all too many women, `Look, you have to leave school.' We ought to let these parents complete the school and, therefore, they are going to do much better for themselves and much better for their children as well. 
Mr. President, I, therefore, want to make it clear that I will offer this amendment. I see my colleague, the chairman of our Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords, here. I wanted to do it on this bill, but we got into this impasse. I care about IDEA. I didn't want us to have some acrimonious debate and a lot of ill will. So I am withdrawing the amendment; Senator Gregg is withdrawing his amendment. Therefore, I will look for another vehicle. 
The higher education bill is going to come before us. It is a good bill, a bipartisan bill. This amendment, I promise colleagues, is as reasonable as it can get. There is no reason in the world why we would want to put States in a position and put too many parents in a position of not being able to complete 2 years of education. It certainly would make a huge difference to them. 
Just one other word. I gather that we are going to talk about IDEA, and Senator Gregg or Senator Gorton is going to want to come to the floor and speak about that, and Senator Harkin can respond to what they have to say. For my own part, I thought we had a really strong agreement on IDEA. I think we should stick to that. It is a bipartisan agreement. It is important to make sure that children who are disabled have equal opportunities. I would hate to see us weaken this very, very important step that we have taken as a Senate. We will not be dealing with that debate tonight. But this amendment on higher education will be there. 
I also want to say one other thing to my colleagues, and then I will finish. 
Again, please look at the evidence that is coming in. What you are going to see with the welfare bill is that in all too many cases, we have now seen a reduction in the caseload, that is true, but it does not equal the reduction of poverty, which is where we should be heading. Too many of these parents are finding jobs, but they pay barely minimum wage without any health care benefits. 
In addition, the child care arrangements are really rather frightening, and too many small children, prekindergarten children, are not receiving good developmental child care. Too many children who are age 4 are home alone, and too many children are going home from school alone. 
We really have to look at what is happening, because a year from now or 2 years from now or 3 years from now, depending on the States, there is going to be a drop-dead date certain, and there will be no assistance. We have to know whether these families are reaching economic self-sufficiency, and the best way these families can do that is for that mother to be able to get an education. 
If we want real welfare reform or we want to reduce poverty or we want to have a stable middle class in our country, there is nothing more important to do than to make sure that we focus on a good education and a good job. That is what this amendment is about. 
I thank my colleague from Georgia for his graciousness. I hope when I offer this amendment there will be good, strong support. I yield the floor.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, April 9 is National POW Recognition Day, and I rise today to pay tribute to all those U.S. service persons who guarded their country in past wars, who have been listed as POWs or MIA, and to their families. I especially want to pay tribute to Col. Richard A. Walsh III, an Air force pilot from Minnesota listed as missing-in-action in Laos. We must never forget Richard and the other MIAs for their courageous service and sacrifices. In addition, we must never forget the sacrifices made by their families. 
That is why I also want to recognize Richard's wife and a constituent of mine, Ms. Sharon Walsh. As the executive director of the Minnesota League of POW/MIA Families, Sharon has worked hard over the years on behalf of our POW/MIAs and their families, and I commend her. I can't imagine how difficult and painful it has been for Sharon and her family not knowing exacting what happened to Richard in Southeast Asia. 
Ms. Walsh asked me to enter into the Congressional Record a document outlining some of her concerns and questions regarding the issue of satellite imagery and American POW/MIAs during the war in Southeast Asia. She, along with a small group of my constituents, are frustrated with certain federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. These agencies are responsible for maintaining and publicly disclosing information about reported U.S. satellite imagery of possible pilot distress symbols, associated with American service personnel who are unaccounted for in Southeast Asia. The statement contains serious allegations about U.S. government mishandling of these matters. My constituents claim that since the war has ended U.S. satellite imagery has detected pilot distress symbols on the ground in Southeast Asia, and the U.S. government has willfully ignored key evidence in this matter. The Department of Defense POW/MIA office has repeatedly indicated to me, and in the media, that they have fully and carefully investigated these claims and found them baseless, attributing the reported symbols to unrelated, largely natural causes, and to mistakes in photographic interpretation of satellite imagery.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senate has just passed H.R. 629, legislation granting congressional consent to the Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact. I have often been asked why I--a senator from Minnesota--should have such a deep and abiding interest in this legislation, which appears to involve only those three states. Until this week, I had not agreed to a time limit for debate, and this held up consideration of the bill for more than year. I think I owe it to my colleagues to explain why I was insisting on a full and thorough debate, and why I think this discussion is so important. 
What has troubled me from the very beginning is that this legislation would result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste in a small, poor, majority-Latino community in rural West Texas--a town called Sierra Blanca. In this respect, the Texas/Maine/Vermont Compact is different from other Compacts the Senate has considered. We know beforehand where this waste will be dumped. The Texas legislation in 1991 identified the area where the dump will be located. The Texas Waste Authority designated the site near Sierra Blanca in 1992. A draft license was issued in 1996. 
Whether we like it or not, this knowledge makes us responsible for what happens to Sierra Blanca. I'll be the first to acknowledge that this is a terrible responsibility. The fate of the people who live there ultimately rests in our hands. Their livelihoods, their community, their property, their health, their safety, and in many respects their lives, all depend on how we choose to proceed on this bill. 
I believe very strongly that the Compact raises important and troubling issues of what has variously been described as `environmental justice,' `environmental equity,' `environmental discrimination,' or `environmental racism.' And a diverse array of civic organizations agree with me about this. The Texas NAACP, The Sierra Club, the League of United Latin American Citizens (or `LULAC'), Greenpeace, the Bishop and the Catholic Diocese of El Paso, the House Hispanic Caucus, Friends of the Earth, and Physicians for Social Responsibility, to name just a few. 
As a very basic proposition, I think we can all agree that it's wrong for poor, politically powerless, minority communities to be singled out for the siting of unwanted hazardous waste dumps. It's wrong when that happens in Sierra Blanca, and it's wrong when it happens in hundreds of other poor minority communities all across this country. I want to do whatever I can to stop it, and I don't see why every one of us should not want to do the same. I don't understand why it should be considered unusual for a senator to care about these things. On the contrary, I think it should be unusual for a senator not to care about these things. 
Let me tell you something about Sierra Blanca. It's a small town in one of the poorest parts of Texas, an area with one of the highest percentages of Latino residents. The average income of people who live there is less than $8,000. Thirty-nine percent live below the poverty line. Over 66 percent are Latino, and many of them speak only Spanish. It's a town that has already been 
saddled with one of the largest sewage sludge projects in the world. Every week Sierra Blanca receives 250 tons of partially treated sewage sludge from across country. And depending on what action Congress decides to take, this small town with minimal political clout may also become the national repository for low-level radioactive waste. 
Supporters of the Compact would have us believe that the designation of Sierra Blanca had nothing to do with the income or ethnic characteristics of its residents. That it had nothing to do with the high percentage of Latinos in Sierra Blanca and the surrounding Hudspeth County--at least 2.6 times higher than the state average. That the percentage of people living in poverty--at least 2.1 times higher than the state average--was completely irrelevant. They would have us believe that Sierra Blanca was simply the unfortunate finalist in a rigorous and deliberate screening process that fairly considered potential sites from all over the state. That the outcome was based on science and objective criteria. I don't believe any of this is true. 
Let me be clear. I'm not saying science played no role whatsoever in the process. It did. Indeed, based on the initial criteria coupled with the scientific findings, Sierra Blanca was disqualified as a potential dump site. It wasn't until politics entered the picture that Sierra Blanca was even considered. 
I think its worth taking a moment to review how we get to where we are today. The selection criteria for the dump were established in 1981, and the Texas Waste Authority hired engineering consultants to screen the entire state for suitable sites. In March 1985, consultants Dames & Moore delivered their report to the Authority. Using `exclusionary' criteria established by the Authority, Dames & Moore ruled out Sierra Blanca and the surrounding area, due primarily to its complex geology. 
Let me quote from that report. Features `applied as exclusionary as related to the Authority's Siting Criteria' included `the clearly exclusionary features of: complex geology; tectonic fault zones,' et cetera. `The application of exclusionary geological criteria has had a substantial impact' in screening potential sites, the report observed. In its final composite, the report explained, `Complex geology and mountainous areas in West, West-Central, and the Panhandle of Texas were excluded,' including the Sierra Blanca dump site. The report also found, `Many tectonic faults occur in West Texas within massive blocks of mountain ranges. This area includes El Paso [and] Hudspeth' counties `and has undergone several phases or episodes of tectonic disturbances.' Finally, it went on to observe that, `Although not excluded, the remainder of Hudspeth County does not appear to offer good siting potential.' 
So much for the science. Repeatedly since the early 1980s, the Waste Authority has come back again and again to this politically powerless area. It has designated four potential sites in all, and--with one revealing exception--all of them were in Hudspeth County. There are only three communities in the entire County, all of them poor and heavily Latino, and all of them targeted by the Authority. 
The one exception to the pattern was in 1985, after completion of the engineering consultants' report, Dames & Moore concluded that the `best' sites were in McMullen and 
Dimmit Counties, and the Waste Authority settled on a site in McMullen County. But this decision met with fierce opposition. Politically influential individuals demanded that the Authority move the dump to Hudspeth County. 
At this point any pretense of objectivity was abandoned. The selection criteria were changed in 1985 so as to rule out the two `best' sites identified by Dames & Moore. The new criteria gave preference to sites located on state-owned land. This change had the effect of virtually guaranteeing selection of a site somewhere in Hudspeth County, large portions of which are owned by the state of Texas. 
So the Waste Authority proceeded to designate, based on an informal and cursory process, five sites in Hudspeth County. Its clear choice, however, was Fort Hancock, one of the County's three poor Latino communities. Unfortunately for the Authority, the more politically powerful city of El Paso next door decided to fight back. Together with Hudspeth County, El Paso filed suit against the site selection. They argued that the Fort Hancock site was located in an area of complex geology--like Sierra Blanca, incidentally--and lay on a 100-year flood plain. The amazing thing is that they won. In 1991 U.S. District Court Judge Moody ruled in their favor and ordered that no dump could be built in Fort Hancock, Hudspeth County. 
But the County's court victory was short-lived. The Waste Authority was clearly not about to give up. The Authority went back to the state legislature to get around Judge Moody's decision by once again changing the rules. A legislator from Houston, far to the East where the big utilities are based, proposed a bill that ignored all previous selection criteria and designated Fort Hancock once and for all. Interestingly enough, this maneuver aroused a great deal of public indignation, precisely because of the Authority's perceived discriminatory practice of dumping on Latino communities. 
There was an impressive show of force against discrimination, but the outcome was not exactly what Hudspeth County had in mind. After Judge Moody's remarkable decision, lawyers for El Paso and the Waste Authority worked out a compromise. Fort Hancock would be saved, but a 400 square mile area further north in Hudspeth County would take its place. This oblong rectangle imposed on the map--an area that included Sierra Blanca--was subsequently dubbed `The Box.' The Texas legislature passed the so-called `Box Law' by voice vote only days before the end of session in May 1991. 
Once again, the previous site selection procedures were stripped away. The Box Law repealed the requirement that the dump had to be on public land, the very requirement that had pointed the Authority towards Hudspeth County in the first place. This was necessary because, at that time, the Sierra Blanca site was not public land at all. Most importantly, to prevent another troublesome lawsuit like the Fort Hancock debacle, the Box Law essentially stripped local citizens of the right to sue. It denied them all judicial relief other than an injunction by the Texas Supreme Court itself, and for this unlikely prospect citizens would be required to drive 500 miles to Austin. 
This story is depressingly familiar. A similar scenario unfolds over and over again in 
different parts of the country, with different names and faces in every case. Sometimes there is no intention by anyone to discriminate. But pervasive inequalities of race, income, and access to the levers of political power exercise a controlling influence over the siting of undesirable waste dumps. The people who make these decisions sometimes are only following the path of least resistance, but in far too many instances the result is a targeting of poor, politically marginalized minority communities who lack the political muscle to do anything about it. 
The remarkable thing about this story is that some people in Hudspeth County did fight back. Dell City fought back and won in the early 1980s. Fort Hancock fought back and won their court case in 1991. And make no mistake, the people of Sierra Blanca are fighting back, too. Many of them have been here on the Hill. Father Ralph Solis, the parish priest for Sierra Blanca and Hudspeth County, was here in February, and his delegation may have visited your office. These people know that the odds are stacked against them, but they are persevering just the same. 
One of the amendments I included in this bill is intended to give them a fighting chance. It gives them their day in court--the right to challenge this site selection on grounds of environmental justice. It says that the Compact cannot be implemented in any way--and that would include the siting process, the licensing process, or the shipment of waste to the site--that discriminates against communities because of their race, national origin, or income level. If local residents can prove discrimination in court, then they can stop the Compact Commission from operating the dump. They don't have to prove intent, by the way, although that certainly would be sufficient. All they have to show is disparate treatment or disparate impact. 
I know some of my colleagues don't believe issues of environmental justice are implicated here. Or they may think this is not a question for the Senate to decide. I believe this amendment meets the concerns of those colleagues. All my amendment does is give local residents the right to make their case in court. There is no guarantee they will win. After all, it is extremely difficult to prove environmental discrimination. But I'm glad this amendment has been accepted as part of H.R. 629, and I certainly will insist that it be included in any final legislation passed by this body. I do not see how anyone would want to deny these people a chance to make their case. 
Short of defeating the bill outright, I believe passing this amendment is the only way for us to do right by the people of Sierra Blanca. Yet, as amazing as it sounds, Compact proponents also claim to have the best interests of Sierra Blanca at heart. They claim the Compact will protect local residents because it keeps out waste from states other than Maine and Vermont. They have used this argument again and again, in Sierra Blanca, in the Texas legislature, in the House of Representatives, and they're using it again in the United States Senate. But this argument makes no sense. The dump does not have to be built, it is indeed unlikely to be built without congressional consent to this Compact, and the Compact would not protect Sierra Blanca in any event. 
The point that keeps getting lost here is there's no compelling reason why the Sierra Blanca dump must be built. Some of you might have seen the headline in the New York Times 
on December 7 of last year: `Warning of Excess Capacity in Nation's Nuclear Dumps--New Technology and Recycling Sharply Reduce the Volume of Nuclear Waste.' The article discusses a study by Dr. Gregory Hayden, the Nebraska Commissioner for the Central Interstate Compact Commission. Dr. Hayden found that `there is currently an excess capacity for low-level radioactive waste disposal in the US without any change to current law or practice.' He went on to explain, `These disposal sites have had low utilization due to falling volumes since 1980. Thus, a high capacity remains for the future, without any change to the current configuration of which states may ship to which disposal site.' Let me repeat the essential point: there is no compelling need for any new low-level radioactive waste dumps in this country. And if no new dump is built, nobody can argue that the compact is needed to protect Sierra Blanca. 
The most popular argument for building another dump involves disposal of medical waste. I'm sure all of you have heard it. It's claimed that waste from medical facilities and research labs is getting backed up--that it has to go somewhere. But let me emphasize one central and indisputable fact: over the last few years, over 99 percent of the waste from Maine and Vermont has come from nuclear reactors. Less than one percent has been from hospitals and universities. And from all three states, 94 percent of the low-level waste between 1991 and 1994 came from reactors. This dump is being built--first and foremost--to dispose of radioactive waste from nuclear reactors, not from hospitals. 
So why are the nuclear utilities hiding behind hospitals and universities? It's not very hard to figure out. In 1984 the Texas Waste Authority hired a public relations firm to increase the popularity of nuclear waste. The PR firm recommended, `A more positive view of safe disposal technologies should be engendered by the use of medical doctors and university faculty scientists as public spokesmen for the [Texas Waste] Authority.' `Whenever possible,' the report said, `the Authority should speak through these parties.' Well, that advice has been followed to the letter. We all have sympathies for hospital work and university research. I know I do. But we cannot let those sympathies blind us to the existing excess capacity for disposal of low-level waste. 
Not only has there been no convincing demonstration of need for this dump, but odds are no dump will be built if the Compact fails. Let me quote from an article from the Texas Observer of last March: `Texas generates nowhere near enough waste on its own to fill a three-million cubic feet dump, and by its own projections [the Texas Waste Authority] could not survive without Maine and Vermont's waste.' Moreover, there are indications the Texas legislature will not appropriate funding to build the dump if Congress rejects this Compact. Texas lawmakers refused the Waste Authority's request for $37 million for construction money in FY 1998 and FY 1999. In fact, the Texas House initially zeroed out all funding for the Authority, but funding for licensing was later restored in conference committee. My understanding is that construction funding was made contingent on passage of the Compact, whereupon Maine and Vermont will each be required to pay Texas over $25 million. 
Supporters of the Compact are trying to have it both ways. When challenged about the environmental justice of targeting Sierra Blanca, they respond that no site has been selected, and environmental justice can only be addressed if and when that ever happens. Then in the same 
breath they insist that the dump in Sierra Blanca is definitely going forward and the Compact is therefore necessary to protect local residents from outside waste. So which is it? Either the Sierra Blanca dump is a done deal or it's not. The truth is, the most likely scenario is that the dump will be built in Sierra Blanca if Congress approves this Compact, subject to any legal challenges, but the project will not go forward if the Compact is rejected. 
Even if the dump is built, however, the Compact does not protect Sierra Blanca. The Compact Commission would be able to accept low-level radioactive waste from any person, state, regional body, or group of states. All it would take is a majority vote of the Commissioners, who are appointed by the Compact state governors. Why should the people of Sierra Blanca expect unelected commissioners to keep waste out of their community? Is there anything in their recent experience that would justify such faith? 
The fact is, the state will have every economic incentive to bring in more waste. The November 1997 report by Dr. Hayden concluded that `the small volume of waste available for any new site would not allow the facility to take advantage of economies of scale. Thus, it would not even be able to operate at the low-cost portion of its own cost functions.' The new dump will need high volume to stay profitable. The Texas Observer reports, `A 1994 analysis by the Houston Business Journal suggests that the Authority would open the facility to other states to keep it viable.' 
We have here the potential for establishing a new national repository for low-level nuclear waste. Not only will Texas have an incentive to bring in as much waste as possible, but the same will be true of nuclear utilities. The more waste goes to Sierra Blanca, the less they will be charged for disposal. Rick Jacobi, General Manager of the Texas Waste Authority, told the Houston Business Journal: `The site is designed for 100,000 cubic feet per year, which would be about $160 per cubic foot. But if only 60,000 cubic feet per year of waste arrives, the price would be $250 per cubic foot.' That's a big difference. As Molly Ivins says, `That sure would drive up costs for Houston Lighting and Power and Texas Utilities.' And the going rate at one existing dump is a whopping $450 per cubic foot. In the end, it will be in the economic interest of everyone--from the nuclear utilities to the Waste Authority--to ship as much waste to Sierra Blanca as they can. 
My second amendment addresses this problem. Throughout the process of approving the Compact, supporters claimed the waste would be limited to three states. I want to hold them to that promise. My amendment puts that promise in writing. I doubt anyone would disagree that this understanding was shared by everyone who participated in the Compact debate. If Compact supporters truly plan to limit waste to three states, which has been everyone's understanding all along, they can have no objection to my amendment. It's nothing but a protection clause. A nearly identical amendment--called the Doggett Amendment--was attached to the bill passed by the House. I am pleased that the Senate has accepted my amendment, but I will insist that it be included in any final legislation passed by this Congress. 
There are other issues I will not be able to address with amendments. I think there is a fundamental concern about whether this kind of disposal is safe at all. The League of 
Conservation Voters warns that, despite the hazards involved, waste will be buried in soil trenches destined to leak, as have nuclear dumps in Kentucky, Illinois, and Nevada. LCV did score the House vote on final passage, and has announced that it may score Senate votes as well. 
There is also an obvious concern about the unsuitability of Sierra Blanca's geology--the exclusionary criterion from the 1985 Dames & Moore report. Sierra Blanca is situated right in the middle of the state's only earthquake zone. Its 1993 license application stated that this is `the most tectonically active area within the state of Texas.' In April 1995 there was a 5.6 earthquake 100 miles away, in Alpine, Texas. And there have been two tremors in the area in the last four years. 
The concern about the environmental impact of this dump extends well beyond the border. The Mexican equivalent of the EPA announced its opposition on March 5 on grounds that the Sierra Blanca dump poses an environmental risk to the border region. On February 11, the Mexican Congress, represented by its Permanent Commission, declared `that the project in Sierra Blanca in Texas, and all such dumping projects along the border with Mexico, constitute an aggression against national dignity.' Moreover, the project apparently violates the 1983 La Paz Agreement between Mexico and the U.S., which commits both countries to prevent pollution affecting the border area. 
My paramount concern, however, and the reason I have resisted a time agreement on this bill, was that I could not stand by and watch while a poor, politically powerless, Latino community was targeted to become the premier repository of low-level nuclear waste for the entire country. Much less give it my blessing. Not when I have the power to do something about it. At the very least, the amendments I included in this bill will keep Sierra Blanca from becoming a national dump, and will give local residents their day in court to seek elusive relief from environmental discrimination. 
I hope my amendments accomplish something more than that, as well. I hope they keep alive the spirit of community this controversy has ignited. The newspaper columnist Molly Ivins has written that `this is community action and local organizing at its very best.' I couldn't agree more. We have to maintain grass-roots pressure on the House or the conference committee, as case may be, to keep these amendments in the bill. And I hope the residents of Sierra Blanca will continue this struggle in every forum possible. I do believe they have right on their side, and I am still naive enough to hope and believe that right can beat might, and that justice can prevail against the odds.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, colleagues. 
The veterans' health care--some background--is funded by two sources: appropriations and a supplemental fund called the MCCR. The President's budget cut veterans' health care appropriations by $29 million, and the estimate is that the MCCR fund will generate $10 million less--a conservative estimate; CBO says much more than that. 
This sense-of-the-Senate amendment simply puts that $40 million back. It makes the budget whole, takes it to last year's level. I hope there will be a strong vote for this. This is a vote to restore the funding and to make the veterans' health care system whole, at least as good as it was last year. We ought not to be cutting veterans' health care benefits. I hope I get an overwhelmingly positive vote on this.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. 
Mr. President, I don't know how to say much in a minute and a half. Let me just say to my good friend from Idaho that I believe the second-degree amendment is not a step forward. I think it is a great leap sideways. A study is not what we are talking about. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know what is at issue here. This is money that we believe should have gone to veterans for compensation. If it doesn't go directly for compensation, this $10 billion-plus ought to go into the VA budget. It ought to be there for disabled veterans. It ought to be there for health care for veterans. 
There are a lot of gaps. There are a lot of holes in this VA budget. As is, we are not living up to a contract for veterans. My colleagues are absolutely right in what they are doing, and I rise to speak on the floor of the Senate to support the Rockefeller-Specter amendment. I hope we will defeat the second-degree amendment and pass this amendment.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am here to support the Senator from Iowa in asking that we be allowed to vote on S. 1150, so that we may provide crop insurance to the farmers in this country and begin to restore food stamps to some legal immigrants who lost eligibility under welfare reform. It is a bill financed primarily by funds from reducing the federal dollars for the administration of food stamps and provides the perfect opportunity to start correcting the mistakes made under welfare reform in denying legal immigrants access to the food stamp program. In addition it could allow full funding for crop insurance for next year and beyond. The only way Congress could avoid leaving farmers exposed in this way, would be to provide significant increases to crop insurance during the appropriation process. It will be incredibly difficult to increase crop insurance through the appropriations process because of the tight discretionary caps and the tremendous pressure on all programs. 
As currently drafted, S. 1150 would provide just over $800 million for FY1999-FY2003 to restore benefits to approximately 250,000 people. That is less than a third of those who lost their eligibility under welfare reform. It is a step in the right direction and we as the Senate should have the right to vote on this legislation. 
We are not a country built on denying food to children and their parents. Yet that is essentially what we did when we passed Welfare Reform. Estimates suggest that around 900,000 legal immigrants lost their eligibility. In addition, 600,000 citizen children with legal immigrant parents have seen their family's food stamps reduced. Denying access to nutrition will indeed affect children. It might be in terms of reducing children's food or it might be in terms of family dynamics, job performance or children's accomplishments. The reality is food is a basic need that if lost or reduced has rippling effects on a family. 
The legislation that has been stopped would, if passed, begin to return food stamps to the neediest of those immigrants who lost eligibility under welfare reform: children, elderly and disabled. In addition it extends eligibility of asylees and refugees from 5 to 7 years to allow them the time required to apply for citizenship. The remaining $1.1 billion would ensure the much needed funding for crop insurance and increase the much needed funds for agriculture research. Agriculture research funds are critical to improving food safety and providing a better quality food supply for all consumers. I encourage the President to allow the Senate to vote on this legislation so that we may improve food stamp eligibility to legal immigrants and ensure crop insurance to our farmers.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate's attention to a recent initiative that addresses a very important international issue: the use of torture. At its last session, the United Nations General Assembly decided to proclaim June 26th as `United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.' The General Assembly proclaimed the day `with a view to the total eradication of torture and the effective functioning of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which entered into force on 26 June 1987.' Governments and non-governmental organizations are developing plans on how to observe this day in a manner that will recognize the needs of torture victims and the necessity of preventing torture. 
Torture is a most effective weapon against democracy. Torture victims are often in the forefront of the struggle for human rights and democracy in their own country. The advocates for these ideals are tortured in order to disable them and instill fear in anyone who might aspire for human rights and democracy. As a refuge for the persecuted, the United States may have as many as 400,000 victims of torture. They come from all regions of the world. Many come from Iraq, Iran, China, Ethiopia, Liberia, El Salvador, Guatemala and many other countries too numerous to mention. Because of their experience with torture, they often have special difficulties applying for asylum and adjusting to a new country. They must overcome the physical and mental effects of torture--the latter often requiring months or years of therapy. Nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety attacks, and depression are just some of the mental consequences of torture. In some cases it may be years before the victim recognizes that treatment is necessary to overcome these psychological roadblocks. 
Plans are being made around the world to recognize the contribution of torture victims. In Denmark, the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and the Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims are planning a series of event and activities. In Greece, where torture was prevalent not so many years ago, the Medical Rehabilitation Center for Torture Victims (MRCT) will hold an event at what was, during the dictatorship, the Special Interrogating Unit of the Military Police (a notorious torture and detention center). The building is now used for historical memorial purposes, and symbolically the area has been renamed Park of Freedom. A variety of activities are planned, including speeches by torture victims and refugees. 
I am very proud that the first and most comprehensive treatment center for victims of torture in the United States, the Center for Victims of Torture, is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It now treats an average of 150 clients a year who come from all regions of the world and are now settled in Minnesota. Many of the Center's clients and former clients are now making significant contributions to our communities and we are grateful to have them. The Center is planning a special event for June 26th. 
Mr. President, on February 4th I introduced the Torture Victims Relief Act (S.1606). My bill is co-sponsored by Senators Tom Harkin, Edward Kennedy, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Barbara Boxer, Byron Dorgan, and Richard Durbin. The legislation provides a focus and a framework of the debate about where torture survivors, and our response to the practice of torture by other countries, fit within our foreign policy priorities. Providing treatment for torture survivors is one of the best ways we can show our commitment to fighting human rights abuses around the world. 
Mr. President, I strongly urge this administration and this Congress to undertake activities on June 26th to recognize the important contributions torture victims have made on behalf of human rights and democracy and the contributions they have made to our country as well. I suggest that President Clinton invite some torture victims to attend a ceremony at the White House where they would be recognized for their contributions. The invitees should be from countries representing a wide geographic and political distribution. 
On that occasion the President could announce some initiatives the administration is taking to support torture victims and prevent torture. I would suggest that the President consider taking the following initiatives: (1) Increase the U.S. contribution to the United Nations Voluntary Fund from $1.5 million to $3.0 million, as recommended in the conference report of the State Department authorization bill; (2) Direct the Agency for International Development to set aside $5 million in fiscal year 1998 funds to assist treatment centers for torture victims abroad; (3) Direct the Department of Health and Human Services to set aside $5 million in fiscal year 1998 funds to assist treatment centers for victims of torture in the United States; and (4) Announce administration support for the Torture Victims Relief Act (S. 1606).

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Washington really brings to this debate her own life experience, both at the higher education level, training other men and women to be teachers, and also herself having taught really at the critical age, in the very early years of a child's education. We don't have that many Senators with this background. I think all of us are lucky that the State of Washington has sent Senator Murray here to the U.S. Senate. Quite often when we get into these discussions, they are very abstract and very theoretical and all about strategy. But Senator Murray has really lived this debate. She brings, I think, a special expertise and a special passion. I wish more Senators, as we get into this debate, 
could draw from the same kind of background. 
Mr. President, I did not teach at the elementary school level or early childhood development; I was a college teacher. But in the last 7 years I tried my very best to be in schools around the country, but in the main in Minnesota. I think I have been in a school probably about every 2 weeks. What I try to do is turn these assemblies or classes--and there can be anywhere from 100 or 200 to 1,000 students and teachers and support staff in town meetings like all of us have in our States. I say to the students, look, it is kind of like everybody is talking about you but very few people are talking to you or with you. Give me your best wisdom as to what would make for the best education reform. What makes for a good education from your point of view? I say to my colleague from Washington, by coming to the floor with this amendment, she is right on target. Students talk about smaller class size everywhere I go. 
Now, I personally think--and my colleague from Washington mentioned this--that especially at the elementary school level, small class sizes really make a huge difference. I think actually as you look at from K through 12--actually, I argue, after that, in colleges and universities as well--smaller class sizes make a huge difference. With a smaller class size, we have an opportunity to get to know our teachers, they say, to have more rapport with teachers. Our teachers can give us more special attention. We have an opportunity to have teachers that can fire our imagination, teachers that are really free to teach. And teachers say it as well. 
So let me just be clear with colleagues. I remember when I first came here--and I haven't changed my view at all, I say to my colleague from Washington--I was debating with a good friend, Senator Hatch from Utah. I said to the Senator from Utah, `I just feel that this debate is ahead of the story.' When you can come to the floor, or any Senator can come to the floor, and say we have made the commitment to public education--we made the commitment to smaller class size; we made the commitment to making sure that children, by kindergarten, come ready to learn; made the commitment by way of equity financing to schools in districts where people don't have all the financial resources, don't have the good facilities and the textbooks, the buildings are in disrepair; we made the commitment to summer institutes for teachers to meet other teachers and get renewed and fired up about teaching--we have made all those commitments, and it still isn't working, then I say let's consider something else. 
But we have an amendment on the floor that Senator Murray has now introduced, based upon her own life's work, upon what people in communities around the country tell us is important for their children, tell us what is important to them--that is to get some additional Federal resources back at the school district level to reduce class sizes, so all of our children have an opportunity to do well in school, all of our children have an opportunity to reach their full potential. No one amendment, no one expenditure of money accomplishes this goal. 
I say to my colleague from Washington that I thank her for being out here on the floor with this amendment, because this is a concrete step that can make a very positive difference in the improvement of the lives of children in our country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me start out on a personal note. I really consider it an honor to work with Senators. I consider it an honor to be here. Every time I come to the floor of the Senate, I still get goose bumps, and I think it is something I never expected to have a chance to do. 
Senator Dodd is one of the Senators I most love working with because he has been, over the years, such a strong and such a committed voice for children. I thank him for that. 
I think this amendment is extremely important, because all it is really saying is let's hold out a reserve fund for children so when it comes to our commitments here in the Senate, we make the investment. 
I will be brief. I have had a chance to travel the country. I have been in a lot of low- and moderate-income communities. I have been in a lot of other communities. Let me just say that the initial travel I did from Appalachia to Letcher County, KY, to Delta, MS, to inner city Baltimore, to public housing in Chicago, to urban and rural Minnesota, everywhere I go people ask the same question: Where is the equal opportunity for our children? Everywhere I go this focus on how we can make sure the children come to school ready to learn is the priority. We just have to do a lot better for our children. We have to do a lot better for all of our children. 
My colleague from California talked about the welfare bill. She is absolutely right, there are long waiting lists for affordable child care, even longer now, because of the welfare-to-work provisions. 
Above and beyond that, I say that I meet people, they are heroes and heroines of Head Start and child care, they do their very best, and they can make a huge difference for children, but we have long waiting lists all across our country for affordable child care. When you talk to middle-income families--this is not just low-income--working families, they will tell you that the expense may be up to $10,000 or more per child, and it can be up to a quarter of their income. 
This is a huge issue. If there is anything that we could do in the U.S. Senate that would be good for families, that would be good for our country, it would be to make this investment. 
I have said this before and I will say it one more time and I will not say it in a shrill way. I say to both colleagues--and I see my colleague from Washington here on the floor, as well--every time there is a discussion of child care, every time we have a discussion about children, I think of Fannie Lou Hammer, the civil rights leader, Mississippi, daughter of a sharecropper, who said in one of her speeches, `I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.' Sometimes I get tired of the symbolic politics. Everyone loves children. Everyone wants to have a photo opportunity next to 
a child. Everyone says they are for children and education. Every breed of political person says that. But there comes a point in time when if we are really for children we have to dig into our pockets and make the investment. 
There is no more important national security issue than to invest in the health and skills of intellect and character of our children, all of our children. That is what this Dodd amendment speaks to, that is what the position that Democrats are taking speaks to, and I really think that this is where the rubber meets the road. This is where `the differences make a difference.' 
I am hopeful that colleagues on the other side, many of them good friends, many of whom I think do have this commitment, will support Senator Dodd in his amendment. It is just not enough to give speeches. It is just not enough to be talking about how we are for child care and children and education. We have to make the investment. That is what this amendment speaks to. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just say one more time to my colleague from Arkansas, I wish he wasn't leaving the Senate. I can't add too much to what he said. 
Let me just say to my colleague from Arizona, whom I really respect, that I don't agree with him on a lot of issues, but I respect him. I mean that very sincerely. I think this amendment is mistaken, and I rise in strong opposition to it. 
I have just a few quotes. Families USA Foundation states that this provision, the Kyl amendment, `may put increasing pressure on older Americans to choose between getting the health services they need or putting food on their table.' I think Families USA has really had a great deal of credibility. I know what they mean. I think the fear is now, what would happen with the Kyl amendment is that doctors could charge an elderly person, a senior citizen, just about any fee for any visit or service. The problem is that if doctors are now going to be making this judgment and they can charge more than Medicare payments and stay in the Medicare system, the danger is that many will do so. 
I had two parents with Parkinson's, and neither one of them made much money. The Medicare Program was the difference for them between being able to live a life toward the end of their years with dignity, albeit a struggle, and going under. Who is to tell what a doctor decides in any given community? A lot of elderly people are going to be put under enormous pressure. Indeed, it could be a choice between whether or not people get the services they need or whether they put food on the table. 
Also, remember that senior citizens are paying more and more out of pocket. Since we had the debate on universal health care coverage, national health insurance, a few short years ago--a debate we should get back to--the fact is that seniors are paying even more out of pocket for health care costs. For many of them, it is the prescription drug costs. 
I don't know about other States, but my guess would be that in Minnesota the median income for senior citizens may be $15,000 or $16,000 a year. I suppose if you are a senior citizen with an income of $150,000 a year--there are very few, contrary to the stereotype--then you know a doctor could say, `I want you to pay what I am going to charge and we will have this private contract.' Those people would be all right, but for the vast majority of elderly people in our country--and we 
are not talking about a high-income profile--the Kyl amendment is a very real threat to a system that has worked well for people. 
Catholic Charities USA, representing nearly 13 million people, states that the Kyl legislation would `dangerously undermine the Medicare Program.' They are right. 
It would leave `average and low-income Medicare patients at grave risk of substandard care and second-class medicine.' That was in a letter to all Senators from Fred Kammer, March 31--today, my son's birthday. 
The National Council of Senior Citizens, asserting that the Kyl legislation `is fraudulent and should be defeated,' says that the bill would `essentially end Medicare as a national health insurance program for almost 40 million Americans.' 
`This proposal would essentially license doctors to gouge millions of seniors for Medicare services.' That is from a letter to Senator Daschle from Steve Protulis dated today. 
If the Kyl amendment succeeds, `seniors will be left with big medical bills and the doctors will have new weapons to exploit health needs for profit.' That comes from a memo by the National Council of Senior Citizens.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Arizona and to other colleagues, this amendment is profoundly mistaken. This amendment, if passed, I believe, really puts way too many senior citizens at risk. 
The Medicare Program is a universal coverage program. The Medicare Program is, for many seniors, the difference between survival and even life with dignity versus going under. To all of a sudden now say to doctors and other providers in this country that you can charge what you want and still stay in the Medicare system now, I am not in favor of that. But if they do it for 2 years, they are out of Medicare. To tell the doctors and providers they can charge what they want and stay in Medicare, that doctors can decide, for any senior citizen and their families, whether or not they have the money to pay for additional costs the doctors want to impose on them does a grave injustice to the Medicare system. 
I don't hear a lot of senior citizens--I say to my colleagues--in Minnesota saying they want to see the Medicare system `fixed' in this direction. I hear people talking about, `Can there be coverage for prescription drug costs?' I hear people talking about the problems they have when they are faced with catastrophic expenses, not wanting to spend the end of their lives in a nursing home and maybe going under because of that. I hear senior citizens talking about the need to have more funding for home-based health care so they can live at home in as near normal circumstances as possible with dignity. I don't hear senior citizens in Minnesota saying they want the Kyl amendment passed, which will enable providers, in too many cases, to gouge them, to charge what they want to charge to seniors, to put a whole lot of senior citizens at risk. This amendment is mistaken. This amendment undermines the Medicare system, and this amendment should be resoundingly defeated. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, again, colleagues should understand exactly what this sense of the Senate is about. What this amendment is about is what the Kyl legislation is about, which is really quite a change from current policy. Right now what we have said is that if a doctor or provider wants to charge more than the reimbursement he or she will get from Medicare, fine. Go ahead and do it. But if you do that with your own private contracting, then for 2 years you are not in the Medicare system. The reason for that is to protect people, elderly people, who rely on this program. 
Mr. President, again I present to colleagues a very important letter on private contracting, a GAO letter to Senator Moynihan of February 23, 1998: 
Nearly all physicians treat Medicare patients and accept new patients covered by Medicare. The recent data from the AMA indicate that 96.2 percent of all non-Federal physicians treated Medicare beneficiaries in 1996. Moreover, the percentage of physicians treating Medicare patients has increased to 95.2 percent in 1995 from 94.2 percent in 1994; over the last 2 years. 
Mr. President, here is the point. The point is that the Medicare Program is a program that seniors rely on. A lot of Senators may not understand where the Kyl amendment takes us. Where the Kyl amendment takes us is the following direction. 
By the way, people who are covered by Medicare are covered. They are able to get the care they need. My colleague was talking about the horrible example of someone who had a loved one who was struggling with cancer. It's the vast majority of people in the country who do not have insurance or are underinsured who need the most help. We really ought to be expanding Medicare for people in our country. We ought not to be about the business of dismantling Medicare. 
I will use the same example as my colleague from Arizona used, but I will reach a whole different set of conclusions. I will simply say to you: Imagine a situation where you have an elderly couple, age 70. The wife is now battling cancer. It turns out that in the community where they live, under the Kyl amendment, given where the Kyl amendment is taking us, the vast majority of doctors in the community have decided, `Listen, we are going to charge more than Medicare reimbursement will give us. We are going to charge more.' It just so happens that this couple can't afford it. They maybe have a total income of $20,000 or $25,000 a year. 
Now it is two classes of medicine. If you are wealthy, you are going to be able to afford it. But what about the vast, vast majority of senior citizens who can't afford now what doctors are charging them? That is really what we are going into. We are not talking about freedom of choice for elderly people. We are taking a lot of choice away. We are talking about a situation where conceivably in a given community doctors could get together, or the majority of doctors could get together, charge more, still be in the Medicare system, and decide for each and every elderly person and their loved one what they pay--what they pay. 
A whole lot of people who now can go and get the care they need, given the Medicare system, may no longer be able to afford it. The whole purpose of Medicare was that we said when you get to be older, you are going to incur more health care costs and we want to make sure that there is coverage for you, that we should at least do that for elderly people. Why in the world would we want to turn the clock back? Why in the world would we want to turn our backs on elderly people? Why in the world 
would we now want to create a situation where, if you are wealthy--and by the way most senior citizens are not--you have it made. Yes, you can contract with this doctor and these doctors. This doctor or these doctors can charge you anything they want to. But for the vast majority of people, Medicare beneficiaries, this will not work well. This will not work well.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. 
Let me just give an analogy. Take the Kaiser plan. It is well known, a managed care plan. You join the Kaiser plan and you are going to pay a given fee, the enrollees pay a given fee. Can you imagine what it would be like if all of a sudden doctors in the Kaiser plan could decide on their own, based upon what particular citizens they were seeing, that they would charge more for service? You join the plan just like people join Medicare. You join the Kaiser plan. Where Senator Kyl is taking us, it would be as if doctors in the Kaiser plan could now say to the enrollees, `By the way, we have decided we are going to charge you more for coverage of this service.' I mean, people would be furious. People would feel betrayed. People would say, `Wait a minute, that is not the contract with us.' 
Medicare is a sacred contract with senior citizens. We ought not create this gigantic loophole for too many providers who I fear rip off elderly people to charge fees for services that senior citizens cannot afford. We ought not tear up a very sacred contract. 
I hope we will have a strong vote against this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank the managers of the bill, as well as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, for accepting my amendment. I offered it on behalf of myself and Senators Conrad, Dorgan and Daschle to address a shortfall in funding during the current fiscal year of USDA farm credit programs in our states and across the country as a result of disastrous weather and economic conditions. 
The amendment is simple. It adds $8.6 million in appropriation to this emergency supplemental spending bill for Farm Service Agency operating loans, both guaranteed and direct. The amendment adds $3.2 million in appropriation for direct farm operating loans, which allows lending authority of $52 million nationwide. This is in addition to the $3.1 million of appropriation and approximately $48 million in lending authority that already was in the bill, bringing the total amount of lending authority for FSA direct operating loans in the bill to approximately $100 million. The amendment also adds $5.4 million in appropriation for guaranteed subsidized interest loans, allowing lending authority of approximately $56 million for that existing FSA program. Previously there was no money in the bill for this type of credit. 
I will include in the Record a letter from my state's Farm Service Agency office, signed by the state director and FSA state committee members from Minnesota. The letter not only documents the dire need for additional funding in this bill for these two important programs, but explains what has become a farm crisis in parts of Minnesota. I don't use the word crisis lightly. It causes me some pain to observe that it is an accurate word. I attended a meeting in Crookston, Minnesota a number of weekends ago, called for the purpose of addressing the increasingly disturbing economic conditions, especially in the Northwestern part of the state, as well as in North Dakota. There was a sign on the building that announced, `Farm crisis meeting.' I attended far too many farm crisis meetings in Minnesota during the 1980s, and it was with some dismay that I read that sign as I entered the meeting in Crookston. But I must note that from what farmers and bankers in these communities are telling me, from what I saw and heard in Crookston, we have a grave situation. 
I will also include in the Record an article from the Star Tribune, Minnesota's largest-circulation newspaper, titled, `Red River Valley farmers tell of sorrow that is fallout of 5 hard years.' I am sure that colleagues will recall pictures and descriptions of hardship and travail in the Red River Valley following last year's calamitous floods. But I am hearing disturbing news that farmers elsewhere in the state also are struggling, in many cases due to low prices. 
Madam President, my Dakota colleagues and I do not imagine that the additional farm credit that we are including in this emergency bill will solve the very difficult economic problems in portions of our states' farm economy. It will, however, allow a number of farmers to stay in business this year, to keep operating and, hopefully, to get past immediate difficulty in a way that allows them to maintain an operation that is viable into the future. Each of us also supports legislative proposals aimed at improving federal farm policy. I believe current policy is on a wrong track, that the so-called Freedom to Farm legislation enacted in 1996 was a mistake, and that we should act to raise loan rates for a targeted amount of production on each farm. I also believe that the repayment period for marketing loans should be extended and that crop insurance should be repaired so that affordable coverage can do a better job of covering losses. Further, I intend to push very hard this year for an increase in research to find a means to eradicate a very damaging disease known as scab which is affecting wheat in our region.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I quote from Joseph Stiglitz, World Bank chief economist and senior vice president, in which he called for an end to `misguided policies imposed from Washington.' 
The World Bank senior vice president and chief economist is scathing in what he calls the `Washington Consensus' of U.S. economic officials, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
He talks about a Washington consensus that seeks to increase measured GDP, whereas we should seek increases of living standards, including improved health and education. 
We seek equitable development which ensures that all groups in society enjoy the fruits of development, not just the few at the top. And we seek democratic development. 
That is what he proposes as an alternative to the Washington consensus.

Mr. WELLSTONE. `United Auto Workers International Executive Board Resolution on U.S. Contributions to the International Monetary Fund.' I will quote one section: 
To achieve [an] increase in exports, the IMF insists on austerity measures that include slashing public spending, jacking up interest rates to exorbitant levels, deregulating markets, devaluing currencies, and reducing existing labor protections. The impact on workers and their families is devastating. Workers face massive layoffs and wage cuts, while the prices of basics such as food, housing, energy and transportation skyrocket.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I say to colleagues, I rise to speak against this Washington consensus. This IMF provision may pass with an overwhelming vote, but I want to just be crystal clear. We are, I think most of us, internationalists. I believe that what happens in these countries, in Asia, Indonesia, Thailand and other countries, will dramatically affect our country. I have no disagreement with that. But the IMF over and over and over again has imposed austerity measures, has depressed the wages and living conditions of people in these countries, has been in violation of statutes that are supposed to govern the IMF in relation to human rights, labor, in relation to respect for indigenous peoples, in relation to environmental protection. 
What is going to happen is that these IMF measures are not going to help these countries or help our country. Countries following these IMF prescriptions are going to be forced either to import even less from our country because they do not have consumers because the people are poor--and the people become poor because of IMF austerity measures imposed on these countries. Or these countries--and this is another effect of IMF programs--are going to be forced into devaluing currencies and trying to buy their way out of trouble through cheap exports, which will again end up competing against, and hurting, working families in our country. 
I understand my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, is on the floor. I ask him, is he on the floor to speak against this amendment on IMF or on a different subject?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Alaska. 
Madam President, yesterday we did adopt an amendment I offered which I think will be helpful. It essentially says that the Secretary of the Treasury will set up an advisory committee with members from labor, the human rights community, the social justice community and the environmental community. I think eight members will meet with him--or her--twice a year in the future, twice a year, to monitor whether or not the IMF is living up to its own statutory mandates. Let me just simply say that Muchtar Pakpahan is a labor leader in Indonesia. He is imprisoned; he is in jail. 
He is in jail because he was organizing workers for a higher minimum wage. I went through all the statutes yesterday that apply to the IMF, that are a part of the law. There is supposed to be full respect for human rights; there is supposed to be respect for internationally recognized labor rights; there is supposed to be respect for basic environmental protection provisions, and the IMF is not in compliance. 
Over and over and over again, the IMF turns its gaze away from these conditions in these countries. Over and over and over again, apparently our country, this administration, turns its gaze away. I simply want to say one more time, to quote Joe Stiglitz, World Bank chief economist--I think he is right that this Washington consensus is profoundly mistaken. I think he is right when he says the IMF goes in the opposite direction of raising wage levels, focusing on education, focusing on making sure that citizens in these countries are able to benefit from the infusion of capital, that it ought not to be just about the investors and the bankers. It ought to be about improving the living standards of people in these countries. 
I think he is right to suggest that what is going to happen as a result of austerity measures imposed on these countries, as has been done in the past, there will be fewer people in these countries to consume our products. And these countries will be exporting cheaper and cheaper products into our country, again, hurting working families. 
We have missed a tremendous opportunity. The United States of America and the U.S. Senate, on this vote, which I think will be an overwhelming vote in favor of this, will have missed a tremendous opportunity to be on the side of internationally recognized labor standards, to be on the side of human rights, to be on the side of environmental protection, to be on the side of improving the living standards of people in these countries. We have missed this opportunity. And I believe that this infusion of capital into the IMF, if the IMF's flawed programs are imposed on these countries, will, in fact, end up not only hurting these countries, but also hurt severely the people in our own country as well. 
I think it is a tragic mistake on our part not to have used this moment, not to have used our leverage to change the flawed policies of the International Monetary Fund. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-2-19980326</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to start out by reading from a letter to Senator Kennedy from Nancy-Ann Min DeParle: 
Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to request your assistance in securing funding for HCFA to implement the insurance reform provisions of HIPAA. The $6 million and 65 FTEs that we have requested for this purpose will allow us to implement the HIPAA provisions, as well as those enacted subsequently in the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act and the Mental Health Parity Act in those states that have not fully implemented HIPAA. 
We had this discussion yesterday. But as we approach a possible vote on this amendment, let me say one more time--and I have a letter here from Laurie Flynn, executive director, which Senator Kennedy offered during other parts of this debate. I want to focus on the mental health parity. Laurie Flynn, executive director, a very strong advocate for people struggling with mental illness, concludes her letter by saying: 
Consequently, on behalf of NAMI's 172,000 members nationwide, I am writing to express my strong appreciation of your leadership in advocating for adequate funding to support HCFA's enforcement responsibilities under HIPAA. 
Mr. President, there are still some 30 States, or thereabouts, that are not yet in compliance. Again, in the last Congress, we passed the Mental Health Parity Act. This was an enormous step forward. We said to a lot of women and men and to their families that we are going to rise above the stigma, we are going to make sure that there is coverage for you, at least when it comes to lifetime and annual caps; we are not going to have any discrimination, and we are going to treat your illness the way a physical illness is treated. We know that much of this is biochemical. We know that pharmacological treatment with family and community support can make all the difference in the world. Hopes were raised, expectations were built up. 
Now, what we are talking about is making sure--I say again to my colleague what I said yesterday--that this is enforced, that this is implemented. I am very worried that without this additional womanpower and manpower, we are not going to be able to actually enforce this law of the land; we are not going to be able to have this implemented around the country. 
My colleague from Oklahoma keeps talking about bureaucrats. I go back to what I said yesterday. We are always talking about bureaucrats. We can also be talking about men and women in public service who have a job to do. In this particular case, the job is to make sure that the law of the land is implemented. It is to make sure that there isn't discrimination against people struggling with mental illness, that there isn't discrimination against their families, and that we make sure that States or insurance companies or plans are in compliance. I think that is what this debate is all about. 
Now, Senator Kennedy has letters from all sorts of organizations, consumer groups, people struggling with disabilities, and on and on and on--I am sure he read from them--which are basically saying the same thing. 
One more time, I simply want to say that the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill really was important to millions of people around the country, 
to millions of families. People now had every reason to believe that because they had a bout with cancer or with diabetes or other kinds of illnesses, they weren't going to be denied coverage because of a `preexisting condition'; they would be able to move from one company to another and not lose their plan. It was now the law of the land that insurance companies could not discriminate against them in that way. This additional request --yes, it is an emergency request because it is an emergency to these families--is to make sure that, in fact, people are able to have the assurance that they won't be able to be discriminated against and to make sure that families that are struggling with mental illness won't have to be faced with that discrimination. This is the right place to make sure that we put the funding into this. I say to colleagues, I think for all colleagues who supported this legislation, it would be a huge mistake and I think it is just wrong to turn around now and deny some of the necessary funding for the actual implementation of these laws. 
Either we are serious about ending this discrimination, either we are serious about making sure insurance companies can't deny people this coverage, or we are not. I think this vote on whether or not HCFA will have the resources, which means there will be women and men that will be able to enforce this around the country, is a vote on whether or not we are going to live up to the legislation that we passed. We can't give with one hand and take away with another. So I hope that my colleagues will vote against this Nickles amendment. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall be brief. I appreciate the remarks of my colleague from Texas. I was going to respond in a similar fashion. I will not go over what my colleague from Massachusetts has said. I do not always agree with what the Senator from Texas says, but I like the way he says it. He makes his points in a kind of hard-hitting way, but also with some humor. I think they connect well with people. 
But I look at this in a very different way. I would like to thank the appropriators for responding to a very real problem. I do not think the appropriators in any way, shape, or form, Democrats or Republicans, are attempting to raid the Medicare trust fund. I think the appropriators, both Democrats and Republicans, understood that the legislation we passed last year was very important. It was very important in making sure people were not denied coverage because of preexisting conditions--many people. That is why my colleague from Massachusetts could read letters from organizations representing people who have struggled with cancer, senior citizen organizations, people struggling with mental illness, the disabilities community. 
People, I say to my colleagues, have to live with this fear. It is horrible. It is bad enough to be ill. It is another thing to have to worry that you are not going to be able to even get any coverage. We have passed legislation to say the insurance companies are not going to be able to discriminate against you, but we have not been able to implement it as fully as we want to. 
And on the mental health parity again, I would just say, this is from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. I heard my colleague from Oklahoma speak about it several times. He heard me speak about it several times. I am sure HCFA wishes they mentioned the Mental Health Parity Act. On the regulations, I wish they got them out earlier. I don't think they have enough people to get regulations out. They have a huge, mammoth mandate. But the fact of the matter is, one more time, colleagues, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners reports that 30 States have not yet enacted the mental health parity legislation. Minnesota, I am proud to say, is a State that has enacted this legislation. 
So ultimately this is about whether or not the U.S. Senate supports the appropriators. The appropriators came up with something that was balanced and reasonable. The appropriators understand, and I think what they have proposed represents this understanding, that we have a contract with people in the country. People believe they are going to have some protection. You know, it is hard going against these insurance companies. Can't we make sure there are a few more women and men--I don't just use the word `bureaucrats' with a sneer--who are out there to enforce this law? Can't we make sure there is protection for people? Can't we side with the citizens in this country? 
I know the insurance companies would love for HCFA not to be able to have the womanpower and manpower to enforce this legislation. But I think we should be on the side of the vast majority of people in this country and not on the side of large insurance companies. I think that is what this vote is about, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the Nickles amendment.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me, first of all, just associate myself with the remarks of Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts. And let me talk specifically to my colleague, whom I have a lot of respect for even though we sometimes sharply disagree on issues. 
I am particularly concerned about the effect this has on the mental health parity law that we were able to pass. This was worked out. I was able to do it with Senator Domenici and other Senators as well. My understanding is that there are actually up to 30 States that have yet to comply with this. 
My concern is simple. We passed this legislation. I thought it was a real step forward. I think it is. When we passed this legislation, what we were trying to say--my colleague from New Mexico is here. He may add, and hopefully not detract from what I am saying. But I think what we were trying to say with this legislation is let's try to end some of this discrimination and let's try to make sure that people who are struggling with mental illness get treatment. We ought not to be denying treatment. We ought to, to the maximum extent possible, be treating this differently than any other kind of illness. 
We were able to at least make some progress when it comes to annual caps, and when it comes to lifetime caps, that was kind of a commitment we made. 
I say to my colleague from Oklahoma that this money--especially the $6 million that deals with the enforcement--is all about making sure that HCFA has the capacity that we as a Government have, the capacity to do some monitoring to make sure that as a matter of fact what the Senate passed and what Congress passed by way of mental health parity is implemented around the country. 
In a way, this is an emergency. You can't on the one hand raise people's hopes and say finally we are going to end some of this discrimination, finally you and your loved ones who have been affected by this illness are going to have the opportunity to get some treatment, and then turn around and basically gut the mental health parity provision. 
I say to colleagues that many Senators, Democrats and 
Republicans alike, voted for this. I would make an appeal to you. When you come to the floor of the Senate, either to speak or to vote, please don't vote for an amendment which is going to gut part of the enforcement of this. We need to make sure that this is enforced around the country. 
We made some progress. It was a step forward. But we still have 30 States that aren't in compliance with the mental health parity legislation. This was legislation that commanded widespread support in the U.S. Senate. This was legislation by two authors--Senator Domenici and myself, a Republican and a Democrat. It would be cruel to pass that legislation and then turn around and deny HCFA--I am not as concerned about HCFA as I am the people who would be affected--with having the women power and man power to enforce this. We simply have to make sure that the health care plans and the insurance companies live up to the law. They are not going to do that if we pass a law and then we turn around and undercut the enforcement of this. I think that would be cruel. I think we ought not to do this. 
The intention of my colleague from Oklahoma is not to deny people good coverage. I know that. My colleague from Oklahoma is operating within a different framework. But, from all I have been able to glean from my understanding of what is at stake here, we have two things going on. 
We have the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation, an important piece of legislation which basically said to people in the country: Look, you are not going to be denied coverage because you had a bout with cancer or because you are a diabetic or whatever the case might be. Now, as it turns out, we are having trouble around the country with this, because a lot of insurance companies are raising the rates so high that people cannot afford it anyway. But it was an important step forward. 
Now we have the situation where there is another part that I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues, which is the mental health parity part. We are not going to be able to have mental health parity, we are not going to be able to make sure there is some enforcement in the country, if we turn around and gut HCFA's capacity to do so. 
So I say to colleagues, please, when you come down here to speak or when you vote, do not vote for this amendment. Whatever the good intentions, the effects of this amendment will be cruel. The effects of this amendment are going to turn the clock backwards. This would be a huge mistake, and that is why I come to the floor to speak against this amendment and urge an overwhelmingly strong vote against this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, very briefly, a couple of things. First of all, the administration didn't need to mention specifically mental health parity, because this is the same staff. The 65 additional people, man- and women-power to enforce Kennedy-Kassebaum, it is the same staff that enforces the mental health parity. They don't need to list it. We all know it. It is the same staff. We need that staff. 
There are 30 States that are not in compliance. We have had to battle with companies over the 1 percent rule as well that we had, which said to a company: Look, if your costs go up more than 1 percent--we do not believe that will happen--you can opt out. We had a big battle on that. HCFA is very much a part of making a determination on that question as well. 
Ultimately this is a national law. Ultimately HCFA, indeed, has a very important role to play in monitoring this and in making sure that the law of the land is enforced. So I say to colleagues, this has everything in the world to do with the mental health parity bill that was passed. That is why I am out here on the floor. I am in complete support of the Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation. I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts, it needs to be strengthened. But right now what I am trying to do is fight to make sure that we do not turn the clock back half a century. 
It is time to make sure that States are brought into compliance, that the mental health parity legislation which was passed by this Senate means something in a concrete way for many families, millions of families all around the country. That is not going to happen if we turn around and gut the enforcement of this. 
So I just want colleagues to know, this has everything in the world to do with that mental health parity legislation and it has everything in the world to do with making sure that that law of the land really becomes the law of the land, because it is implemented, because it is enforced, and because it makes a positive difference for millions of families. This amendment takes us in exactly the opposite direction. I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, he is profoundly mistaken.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if other colleagues want to speak on this amendment, I would be pleased to defer to them. If not, I want to go on and speak. 
Mr. President, I would like to bring us back to what I think is the central question before us, and this will be the vote. We passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. It was noncontroversial. We believed it was the right thing to do. What we said, the U.S. Senate, in our collective wisdom, Democrats and Republicans, was that it was simply wrong for an insurance company to deny someone coverage because of a preexisting condition. That was part of what we said with that vote. 
In addition, because the mental health parity amendment was passed, the law was passed as well, we said that we were going to at least take a giant step forward in ending some of the discrimination against people struggling with mental illness. 
We had a request, it was part of this supplemental, for some 
additional funding for HCFA to administer this law. That was noncontroversial until the Nickles amendment. The Nickles amendment eliminates that funding. 
Now my colleague from Oklahoma keeps talking about bureaucrats. Sometimes that gets to be a tiresome and tiring argument because sometimes it is not like `bureaucrats' with a sneer, it is women and men in public service with a very important mission, and the mission is to make sure that people in our country, families in our country, are not denied health care coverage because of discrimination by insurance companies, by health care plans. It is not `bureaucrat' with a sneer, it is men and women who are part of a mission to make sure that we do not just pass a law--we pass a law with great fanfare, and we say to families in the country: `Listen. No longer will it be true that because your daughter is a diabetic and she has now graduated from college, and she is off your health insurance plan, she can't get coverage. 
No longer will it be true that because your husband had a bout with cancer when he was 55, now that his company has downsized and he is out of work, he won't be able to find any coverage at all. No longer will it be true that if you are suffering, struggling with mental illness, a company or a plan can say to you, `We are going to put a cap on an annual limit of how much coverage you can get, or a lifetime limit.' 
It won't be like someone who is struggling with a heart condition. It won't be like a diabetic. It won't be like someone struggling with another illness. We will put you in a whole other category, that is to say, second-class citizens. It doesn't matter that we have all this research talking about biochemical connection. It doesn't matter we are finally getting out of the dark age and getting beyond the stigma. We will make sure some of this discrimination ends. 
We said all of that. 
Now the rubber meets the road. That was noncontroversial, I think, before this amendment. A request by the administration for some additional funding for HCFA to make sure that this law of the land is implemented, that people are held accountable should be noncontroversial. It is like you give with one hand and you take away with another. 
Now, Pennsylvania, for example, has notified HCFA they are not going to comply with the mental health law. There are some 20 other States that are expected to miss the original deadline. That is just the tip of the iceberg. 
The truth of the matter, I say to my colleague, is that when States do a great job, insurance companies do a great job. We are pleased with that. But if you don't, the way the law of the land reads is that HCFA can come in and say, `You have to; this is the law of the land. That is the legislation we passed.' 
What we have here, just be clear about this, is an effort to gut this. My colleague from Oklahoma says you can hardly expect, if it is such a serious problem, you can hardly expect that an additional 60 people are going to solve it. You know what. I would rather err on the side of trying to make sure that we do everything we can as policymakers to make sure that these laws that have been passed, that have given people so much hope, given families so much hope, are implemented, enforced. Why in the world would we want to pass legislation that gives people hope and then dash that hope? 
I will go back to what I think is at stake, and then I will conclude. There are other colleagues on the floor. I think this is all about living up to a commitment. I think this is about living up to a kind of sacred contract we have with a lot of families in this country. I am proud of what we did with Kennedy-Kassebaum. Not to be a know-it-all, because certainly I am wrong more than I want to be, but I always thought there was going to be a problem with the premiums being jacked up, and in some States that is indeed the problem, where companies say, `Fine, we will cover you--you had a bout with cancer--but we will charge you $15,000 a year.' We have that problem out there. That is the problem. With the voice of the U.S. Senate that said to people in this country, `We are going to try to give you some protection that you are not denied coverage because your loved one has Parkinson's or Alzheimer's or has struggled with cancer or diabetes,' that was the right thing to do. 
On the mental health part, I conclude. That is why I am out here. I am sorry, I will err on the side of caution. To me, what that means is when I see that States aren't able to comply--not all the States are complying--and when I know what the law of the land says and I know what a difficult struggle it has been and I know that a lot of people have some hope that at least this ends part of the discrimination, when I hear we need some additional manpower and womanpower to enforce that law, I am not going to support an amendment that guts that. 
Now, I am quite sure that it will never be perfect. And I am quite sure that these `bureaucrats' may not be able to do it all. 
But you know what. Enforcement of legislation that we pass, it doesn't just sort of happen by accident. It is all about women and men who are involved in public service, who have certain jobs, and who carry out their responsibility. We need that enforcement power. This amendment guts it. 
I just want colleagues to understand what is at stake here. There is more at stake than just this specific amendment. I certainly agree with what the Senator from Massachusetts said about what our offices can expect because those of us, and I think probably all of us, Democrats and Republicans, I think we understand that part of our work is here, but every bit as important is our work back in our States. I find in Minnesota, I say to my colleague from Oklahoma--I can get a smile from him on this even though we are sort of in disagreement on most things--we have a great political event, the Minnesota State Fair. Half the State's population, in 13 days, over 2 million people, come to the Minnesota State Fair. It is unbelievable. Everyone comes up to you. People are generally speaking nice, but they give you a piece of their mind if they don't agree with you. I have learned at the Minnesota State Fair there is hardly anybody talking to me about a lot of bills we deal with. The vast majority of people talk about a letter I responded to, a phone call that I received, or a specific problem that they had as a family that our office in Minnesota was able to help them out on. That means more to people than almost anything. 
I tell you something, that is what this is about. This is about making sure that we help a whole lot of families, families that have to deal with illnesses, and want to make sure they get coverage, families that are in pain and look for someone to help them, families that are struggling with physical illness and, yes, mental illness, that are looking for help and looking for support and looking for protection. There are a whole lot of families like that. There but for the grace of God go I. 
We should not vote for this amendment. This amendment should be soundly defeated, whatever the good intentions of my colleague from Oklahoma are. He always has good intentions, but in my humble opinion, he is profoundly wrong on this question. 
I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-2-19980325</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment says that the Treasury Secretary shall appoint an advisory committee, composed of eight members, at least two of whom are from organized labor, two from nongovernment environmental groups, and two from nongovernmental human rights or social justice organizations. This is an advisory group on IMF policy, which the Senator in the Chair right now has worked very hard on. I know that. 
This advisory group would meet at least twice a year to advise the Treasury Secretary on IMF's compliance with existing statutory requirements relating to IMF promotion in a variety of different areas: High levels of income and employment in other countries, fair labor practices, indigenous people's rights, reductions in military spending, respect for human rights, and sensitivity to the environmental impact of IMF policies. 
The advisory committee shall meet with the Treasury Secretary at least every 6 months to review and provide advice on IMF compliance with these mandates. 
There is no legislative mandate. All the Treasury Secretary has to do is meet twice per year with the committee to hear their views on IMF compliance with existing mandates. 
Let me explain to my colleagues why I bring this amendment to the floor. We spent, yesterday, altogether 30 minutes in debate on IMF. We are talking about, roughly speaking, $17 billion to go to IMF. We are talking about countries in Asia--I have heard my colleague from Alaska say this very forcefully--that are really right now in economic trouble. We are talking about a lot of economic pain. I agree--I am an internationalist--what happens in these countries will dramatically affect people in our country as well. There is no question about it. 
But I want to suggest to colleagues that the question is whether or not the IMF, as I look at the record of the IMF, has been helpful or not helpful in helping these economies and helping the people in these countries. What happens in some of the Asian countries will dramatically affect the lives of people in our country in a number of different ways. Either people in countries like Thailand or Indonesia will not be able to work at decent jobs, will make subminimum poverty wages--in which case, they will not be able to have the money to purchase goods--or, because of IMF policies, which has too often been the case, they will be forced to currency devaluation and they will try to work themselves out of trouble through cheap exports to our country. Either way, working families in Nebraska and Minnesota and Alaska and around our country are hurt if we do not put some focus in the IMF. 
I am about to go through existing laws and statutes that the IMF is supposed to live up to, and I am just going to talk about a whole history of noncompliance. We have not had this discussion on the floor of the Senate. We should. I mean, if in fact what happens in these Asian countries is that we have the IMF pouring fuel on the fire, if you have an International Monetary Fund that imposes austerity measures on these countries, depresses wage levels, has no respect for 
international labor standards, shows no respect for human rights--people cannot even organize to make a decent living, people cannot even organize in these countries like Indonesia in order to make sure that they are paid decent wages--then what is going to happen is, you have countries with a populous where the vast majority of the people cannot buy what we produce in our country. This is like economics lesson No. 1. Or--and this has happened all too often because of IMF prescriptions--what happens is, these countries try to export themselves out of trouble: Currency devaluation, cheap exports to our country, and our workers and our families cannot compete. 
Let me just go through some existing laws right now that are supposed to govern the International Monetary Fund. By the way, they are in noncompliance. The problem is, the administration has not spent much time really insisting on accountability. The problem is, we have turned our gaze away from this. I wish our country would be stronger in supporting international labor standards, stronger in supporting environmental standards, stronger in supporting basic human rights for people. But we have not done that. 
The Secretary of Treasury shall direct the United States executive directors of the international financial institutions to use the voice and vote of the United States to urge the respective institution [this covers the IMF] to adopt policies to encourage borrowing countries to guarantee internationally recognized worker rights and to include the status of such rights as an integral part of the institution's policy dialog with each borrowing country. 
I suggest to colleagues, even though we have not discussed this on the floor of the Senate, that the IMF has ignored this law and that the International Monetary Fund pays precious little attention to whether or not these countries that we bail out live up to internationally recognized labor rights. 
Mr. President, to go on:  
Beginning 2 years after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the United States executive director of each multinational development bank not to vote in favor of any action proposed to be taken by the respective bank which would have a significant effect on the human or environmental assessment for at least 120 days before the date of the vote until an assessment analyzing the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives to the proposed action has been completed by the borrowing country or institution. 
Again, another law that the IMF is supposed to live up to, another relevant statute that there ought to be an environmental impact statement. We ought to look at what these countries are doing; we ought to look at where the money is going. These countries--or many of these countries--are in noncompliance, and the IMF just turns its gaze away from this, as does the United States, our Government. This is not in the name of our people, because I think people in our country support human rights, support respect for the environment.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came to the floor last week--maybe it was a week and a half ago--with an amendment that called on my colleagues to be willing, as responsible policymakers, to take a close look at what was happening around the country, to mainly women and children, as a result of the welfare `reform' bill that was passed in 1996. When I came to the floor, I marshaled evidence as to the need for us to know more, as to the need for some kind of study. What the amendment said was that we should call on States to provide data to Health and Human Services as to how many of the families that were no longer on the welfare rolls were reaching economic self-sufficiency, what kind of jobs people had, what kind of wages, and what about child care for children? 
Mr. President, that amendment I think received about 43 or 44 votes. Maybe the reason the amendment was not agreed to was because I put that amendment on the highway bill, or the ISTEA bill, because I wanted to call attention to what is happening around the country as, from some of my own travel, I have seen it. 
Today we have two front page stories, colleagues. I want to announce my intention on an amendment. One, in the Washington Post, `Sanctions: A Force Behind Falling Welfare Rolls,' 
and the other, in the New York Times: `Most Dropped from Welfare Don't Get Jobs.' 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-2-19980323</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me quote a few relevant paragraphs from both pieces. 
The Washington Post piece: 
Governors across the country are boasting that welfare reform is successfully moving millions of people off the rolls and into jobs. But closer scrutiny of state and federal records shows that tens of thousands of families are being forced off welfare as punishment for not complying with tough new rules. 
Federal statistics show that in one three-month period last year, 38 percent of the recipients who left welfare did so because of state sanctions, ordered for infractions from missing appointments with caseworkers to refusing to search for work. 
The article then goes on:  
During the national debate over welfare reform two years ago, many assumed that the moment of truth would come years from now when recipients reached time limits that would end their benefits. But the widespread use of sanctions has moved up that moment. 
Energized by their welfare reform programs, states are moving swiftly to put their new sanction power to use. But social service advocates argue that in many cases, states are making bad judgments. 
Bill Biggs, a former welfare administrator from Utah, wrote in a recent publication that under a pilot program in his state, half of the sanctions ordered were done in error, often when a caseworker didn't detect that a recipient suffered from mental illness or some other problem. 
I go on: 
State officials and welfare experts say they believe that those who do get cut from the rolls represent the two extremes of the welfare population. At one end are people who are able to find jobs, or have other income, and simply choose not to comply. 
That is less of a problem, I say to my colleagues. They are working, they have a job, they are OK, their children are all right. 
At the other extreme are those unable to meet requirements because they are the most troubled families--plagued by mental illness, substance abuse, domestic violence or such low reading levels that they have difficulty understanding the new regulations, much less finding work. . . . 
Rosy Saunders, a 29-year-old mother of twins in Columbus, Ohio, is frantically applying for jobs to avoid being sanctioned. 
`I have asthma real bad,' she said. `I have two children on [disability]. I had an industrial accident. I have to take pills for depression.' 
But `I still have to get a job or they are going to cut me,' she said. `They told me there was no excuses.' 
End of the Washington Post piece. 
Just to emphasize one point, I say to my colleagues, what may very well be happening right now is that, yes, we are reducing the rolls. It is happening State by State, but the sanctions are invoked on people who are not working, and many of these people are not working because they are unable to work, because they struggle with mental illness, they struggle with substance abuse, or you have women who have been battered over and over and over again, and they are not able to take a job right away. 
Don't we want to know what is happening to these families? Just because they are poor, does that mean they matter any less than any other family in our country? 
The New York Times piece, `Most Dropped From Welfare Don't Get Jobs': 
A vast majority of people who have dropped off New York State's rapidly shrinking welfare rolls have not obtained legitimate jobs, a state survey indicates. 
The survey found, among other things, that of the legions of people who came off the welfare rolls in New York City from July 1996 through March 1997, only 29 percent found full-time or part-time jobs in the first several months after they were no longer on public assistance.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me thank the Senator from Georgia for his graciousness and let me thank my colleague from Alaska. 
Madam President, I think there are two different issues that we are confronted with as we address the Coverdell bill. One of them has to do with just the substantive debate about education, which I want to talk about for a few minutes; and the other has to do with, I guess, the Senate process, which I think is equally important, as we think about the Senate and how we do our work together. 
On the substance, I simply say to my colleague I spend about every 2 weeks in a school somewhere in Minnesota. If I could think of any one area that I feel I have the most passion about, it is education: education of children, preschool, young people, high school, higher ed. For that matter, since I think education is preschool all the way to 85 or 90, education, period. 
As I travel the country, with a special emphasis in Minnesota, I say to my colleague, I can think of much better uses and a higher priority for $1.6 billion to be spent. I put the emphasis not in the direction that my colleague from Georgia goes in, which is people being able to put this money into IRAs. Not a whole lot of families I know have $2,000 they can put into IRAs. This disproportionately benefits people who are fairly well off. It benefits people who especially want to send their kids to private schools and who have the resource to do so. I would rather make an all-out effort to support the public school system. 
I would be pleased to come back to the U.S. Senate some day, the sooner the better, and maybe in a debate change my mind and say that I would be all for applying taxpayers' money to support for private education--and that is why I say the sooner the better--but not until we have made the commitment to public education, not until we rebuild crumbling schools around the country; I have been to too many of those schools in Minnesota, and all around the country as well, and not until we reduce class size, not until we get more teachers and teacher assistants into the classrooms, and not until we have more resources for professional development, not until we make an all-out commitment to really deal with the learning gap between children who do well in school and children who don't do well in school, which starts, I might say, with a real commitment and the resources to early childhood development. I think the medical evidence is irreducible and irrefutable; if we don't get it right for these children by age 3, many of them will never be able to do well in school or well in life. 
I don't understand what I think is a misplaced priority that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have about $1.6 billion that doesn't go directly to public education. And I put the emphasis, and I think the vast majority of the people in the United States of America would put the emphasis, on rebuilding the crumbling schools, on reducing class size, on making sure that we have the best education for our teachers and, I might argue, making sure we do our very best by way of children so that when children come to kindergarten, they come ready to learn. That is where we ought to be investing our resources--not in allocating resources to support private education, not in a Coverdell bill where the benefits disproportionately go to those families which least need those 
benefits. 
The second point speaks more to the majority leader than my colleague from Georgia. I don't have a corner on the truth and I do not want to come off arrogant, but this argument that the majority leader makes about getting to decide what kind of amendments are relevant and dramatically reducing the number of amendments that are out here on the floor presupposes that there aren't any number of different ways of thinking about what is really helpful for education and the development of children and young people in this country. 
I have a number of amendments that I think are important. I think the amendment on rebuilding crumbling schools is right on the mark. I think we devalue children and we devalue the work of adults who work with children when we don't make an investment in rebuilding these crumbling schools. I think reducing class size and more teachers in the classroom is extremely important. If I am going to think about ways of making better use of $1.6 billion, we ought to get back to making sure young people have the hope to go on to higher education. The HOPE scholarship with tax credits that aren't refundable doesn't help very many families in Georgia or Minnesota with incomes under $28,000 a year. Spend a little time in community colleges. The education is not affordable. I have an amendment to take that $1.6 billion and make higher education more affordable for these men and women from working families. 
I have an amendment, since we are talking about children and education, that deals with the cuts we made in the Food Stamp Program, the major safety net program for poor children in America. We made a 20 percent cut in food stamp benefits. The vast majority of the beneficiaries are children. The vast majority of beneficiaries are working poor families. Every single doctor and every single scientist and every single nutritional expert will tell you children don't do well in school when they are malnourished. They don't do well in school when they don't have enough to eat. I think we ought to restore that funding for the Food Stamp Program as it applies to children in America. That is a top priority education program. 
Now we have a majority leader who is saying, `No, I don't want to have debate on all these amendments.' What are my colleagues afraid of? Why would it be too much time to take 4 or 5 days or a week and debate this piece of legislation? 
I have another amendment which I think is terribly important and I think it has everything in the world to do with how well kids do in school. We, right now, all around the country, are saying to single parents--and I spoke about this last week--mainly women, you can't stay in college because of the welfare bill. You have to leave school. Take a job at $6 an hour with no health care benefits. You know what. If those single parents --that means they have children--are able to finish their college education, it means better earnings, better opportunities for their children, more self-esteem for the parent, better educational achievement by the child. I have an amendment which says we ought to make sure that those single parents, those women, are able to finish their college education. I may or may not be able to present that amendment here in this debate. 
I just want to make it crystal clear, Madam President, on both counts I am in opposition with the majority leader on this question. Madam President, $1.6 billion--put it into 
rebuilding crumbling schools, put it into smaller class size. Don't put it into a program that benefits mainly upper income people and private schools. It is that simple. 
Second of all, let's have a debate about education. You cannot decontextualize what happens to children before they go to school and what happens to children when they go home after being in school from how well they do in school. There are a whole bunch of issues--some of them are direct education issues; some of them have to do with whether the parents are doing well employment-wise; some have to do with nutrition; some have to do with health care; some of them have to do with whether or not these young people think they can afford higher education--that dramatically affect how well children do in school. 
I don't think the majority leader ought to, as a priority, decide what are relevant amendments or what kind of debate we ought to have on education. I don't know why my colleagues are afraid of a full-fledged substantive debate about education. Let's take the next week and let's debate the education amendments up or down. 
I said to my colleague from Georgia, to end on a slightly different note, that I appreciated his effort. I said that a few days ago, that I think he is absolutely sincere in what he is doing, even though we disagree and that, most important of all, I look forward to a real debate. I hope we will have that real debate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, it is my understanding--although I think really what we are doing here is just making opening statements on NATO expansion--and my hope, if not this week then when we come back to this discussion, that a number of us will have amendments on the floor and that we will have, hopefully, a sharper and more focused debate. 
Mr. President, I speak on the floor of the Senate about a matter that I think is of great importance. I think the decision that we make here in the Senate about whether or not to support expansion of NATO will, as a matter of fact, crucially affect the quality or lack of quality of the lives of our children and our grandchildren. I have given this matter a great deal of thought. For the last year I have had a lot of discussions, a lot of briefings with a lot of people on both sides of the question. I have done my very best as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota to inform myself. This is a very difficult decision to make. 
There are thoughtful and knowledgeable Senators who are on the other side from where I am. Certainly there are thoughtful and knowledgeable Minnesotans, whom I respect greatly, who have urged me to vote in favor of expanding NATO. So have many of my colleagues. So has President Vaclav Havel from Czechoslovakia, who I believe is one of the giants of the 20th century, a playwright and former prisoner of conscience. When he speaks, with such passion, about the importance of expanding NATO, I listen. I will tell you, probably more than anything, I would like to cast a vote that would please President Havel. 
Why, then, do I oppose the expansion of NATO? Because I have come to believe that it would lead to the redivision of Europe and that we would needlessly poison U.S. relations with Russia for years to come and increase the prospects that in the post-Yeltsin world--President Yeltsin will not be there forever--the ultranationalists and anti-U.S. forces, militaristic forces, will gain power. 
Before I go into greater detail on the reasons for my opposition to enlarging NATO, just permit me to say a few words about the process that I have gone through to reach this decision. Again, I understand full well that our decision has enormous implications for our country and the world. I am a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have had any number of different hearings on this. I have read as many articles as I can read and have talked with as many people as I can talk with. I want to assure my fellow Minnesotans and my colleagues that in reaching this decision I have done my homework. 
That does not mean I am arrogant about it. That does not mean that I believe the people who take a different position have not done their homework. But there are a number of questions and doubts that I have. I have submitted questions in writing to Secretary of State Albright and to other key administration officials. Last June I sent a letter to President Clinton, cosigned by my distinguished colleague Senator Harkin, where we raised a number of different questions. Unfortunately, at least from my point of view, a number of these questions are still out there and administration officials have not allayed my concerns about NATO expansion. So, as I give this matter a great deal of thought, carefully weighing the pros and the cons of NATO expansion and meeting with those who have strong expansionist viewpoints, I still believe that I must oppose NATO expansion. 
Permit me to outline my concerns. The best way is for me to summarize questions that I have had and to talk about some of the answers that have been given but which I do not think are persuasive answers. 
First, what military threat is NATO expansion intended to address? The Russian military has collapsed, the Russian Army's ability to quell tiny, ill-equipped Chechen forces raises doubts about Russia's capability to threaten its former Eastern bloc allies in the foreseeable future. 
Second, arms control agreements signed between 1987 and 1993, that were pushed through by Presidents Reagan and Bush working with President Gorbachev, have helped to establish a new security structure that makes a surprise attack on Central Europe virtually impossible. 
Third, there is peace between states in Europe, between nations in Europe, for the first time in centuries. We do not have a divided Europe, and I worry about a NATO expansion which could redivide Europe and again poison relations with Russia. Why, then, are we rushing to expand a military alliance into Central Europe? 
How can Russia not feel threatened by, one, the prospect of NATO forces moving hundreds of miles closer to its borders and, two, the possibility of further NATO expansions, including even the Baltic States? This has all been left, as my colleague the distinguished Chair knows, open-ended. 
Although the administration claims that extending NATO toward Russia's borders would not threaten Russia, there seems little doubt that many Russians feel threatened, especially, I argue, any number of the opinion leaders in Russia. Whatever explanation there is for the fact that Russian politicians, the reformers, the pro-Western democrats to the centrists to the Communists and even to the extreme nationalists, who may agree with us on little else, all strongly oppose NATO expansion. 
In pursuing the NATO expansion, why is the administration disregarding the warnings of George Kennan and other distinguished Russian scholars that NATO expansion is likely to sow the seeds for a reemergence of antidemocratic and chauvinistic trends in Russia? 
I am especially puzzled by this since it must be evident to both supporters and foes of NATO expansion that European security and stability--and I need to make this point twice--that European security and stability is greatly dependent on Russia's successful transition to democracy. That, I think, is the central point. A democratic Russia is unlikely to threaten its neighbors. I am worried, I am terribly worried. I think this is a profound mistake. I think this NATO expansion could threaten that democracy in Russia, and I think, if we do not have a successful transition to democracy in Russia, that, in turn, threatens European security and stability. 
Why then are we considering a step that is apt to strike at Russian ultranationalists who oppose democracy? George Kennan, who is probably over 90 now, a great scholar--George Kennan is probably as wise and profound a thinker as we have in our country about Russia, about the former Soviet Union. I might add--and I have said this to friends--my father, who was born in the Ukraine, born in Odessa, his family then moved to Russia--they kept moving to stay one step ahead of the pogroms--he was a Jewish immigrant; he came over in 1914 at the age of 17. He never saw his family again. My father had the honor many times--he passed away in 1983--but he had the honor many times to speak with and meet with George Kennan. My father, who spoke 10 languages fluently--I am sorry to say I don't--but my father, who spoke 10 languages fluently, had such great respect for George Kennan's mastery of the language and his understanding of Russia. 
George Kennan has said that expanding NATO `may be expected to inflame nationalistic anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion and to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy.' 
I urge my colleagues to carefully consider George Kennan's words before they cast their votes on ratification of NATO expansion. 
I want to say this about the process: I am in sharp disagreement with the majority leader on the way we are doing this. We had hearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I give Chairman Helms full credit for that. He and Senator Biden--who takes a very different position than I do--have been very respectful about the need to have a debate. But the way we are doing this is we are doing it in bits and pieces. We should have been on the education bill, and we have just come back to NATO as filler until we get back to the education bill. It is a way of avoiding debate about education and education amendments. 
This decision we are going to make about NATO expansion is as important a decision as we are ever going to make. But Senators coming out here, as I have, individually and then leaving after they give speeches is not enough. Yesterday, we had some good discussion. I hope next week, or whenever we take this back up, we will figure out a way to have Senators out here with amendments and we can have a give-and-take discussion and we can have an important debate about this. 
What basis is there for Secretary Albright's claim that expanding NATO will produce an `undivided' Europe? Rather than creating an undivided Europe, my view is that NATO expansion would re-create a dividing line in Europe, only further to the east than the original cold war dividing line, and I do not consider that to be progress for the world. 
In fact, President Clinton himself, before he decided to back NATO expansion, avowed that it would `draw a new line through Europe just a little further east.' This is hardly an academic question, for I believe that a Europe without dividing lines is vital if the continent is to be peaceful, prosperous and secure. That is why I think we will be making a fateful mistake if we vote for the NATO expansion, if we support this. 
Finally, Mr. President, I must ask whether it makes sense for the administration to contend that a key reason NATO expansion is necessary is that it will promote democracy, stability and economic reform in Central Europe. There are a whole lot of countries in the former Soviet Union for whom that challenge is out there. I am not even sure these countries would be the first countries by that criteria. But what I do know is that, if the administration really believes that a prime goal of NATO expansion is to solidify democracy and economic reform, then perhaps we ought to really think about other countries first. Yet I think that would be a mistake. And, most important of all, if we are going to be talking about expanding markets and expanding democracy, why don't we use our leverage--the United States of America--to promote membership in the European Union? 
I think that is the single best way that our country could exert its leadership. The single best way that we could exert our leverage for Poland, for Hungary, for the Czech Republic, if the goal of this is to expand markets and democracy, would be for the United States to be the leader, the leading voice in calling for expansion in the European Union. 
Let me simply say that I do not think a military alliance is the way to do that. I do not think a military alliance has as its primary goal expanding markets and democracy, and, moreover, I think we take a terrible risk. 
In closing, I would like to quote from a New York Times op-ed written over a year ago by George Kennan, a man who, as I said, I have long admired for his remarkable contributions to American diplomacy and scholarship and keen insights into Russian history, politics and diplomacy:  
. . . something of the highest importance is at stake here. And perhaps it is not too late to advance a view, that, I believe, is not only mine alone but is shared by a number of others with extensive and in most instances more recent experience in Russian matters. The view, bluntly stated, is that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the post-cold-war era. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, let me repeat this. I am quoting a profound thinker. George Kennan states: 
The view, bluntly stated, is that expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era. 
Such a decision may be expected to . . . restore the atmosphere of the cold war in East-West relations, and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking. And, last but not least, it might make it much more difficult, if not impossible, to secure the Russian Duma's ratification of the START II agreement and to achieve further reductions of nuclear weapons. 
George Kennan's words have already proved to be prophetic. The START II agreement is stalled in the duma, and troubling frictions have developed with Russia on a number of other issues, ranging from U.S. policy toward Iraq to the management of Russia's nuclear materials. 
I urge my colleagues to ponder George Kennan's powerful arguments and to join me in opposing ratification of NATO expansion.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me conclude on a personal note. What I have tried to say on the floor of the Senate, and I want to summarize, because, again, I actually believe, without being melodramatic, I can truthfully say this has been one of the most difficult decisions. I do not believe for a moment that people who favor NATO ratification are doing it because of simplistic thinking or because they have not thought this issue through, although I think all of us before we cast the final vote should inform ourselves. 
Some people I have tremendous respect for strongly favor NATO ratification. I have met with people back in Minnesota--Czechs, Hungarians and Poles--people who feel so strongly about this, wonderful people, people who have been big supporters of me, and they are disappointed in me. 
I want to say one more time, I have done my best to really be a scholar and to study this matter. I have tried to meet with people representing different points of view. But I very honestly and truthfully believe that this would be a terrible mistake. I think the way to expand democracy and market economies, which is a very important goal for Hungary, for the Czech Republic, for Poland, for other countries, is membership in the European Union. Our country should be using our leverage to make that happen. 
I think there is no reason for NATO expansion. I see no military threat that calls for expansion of a military alliance. I think the downside is that we risk signing arms agreements with Russia, we risk poisoning relations with Russia, we risk putting the democratic forces in Russia in peril, and I think if we don't have a stable Russia, if we don't have a secure Russia, then all of Europe is threatened by that. 
I had a chance to travel to Russia a few years ago. I wanted to visit where my father grew up since he could never go back because the Communists ruled. I went there full of hope, and I came back with less hope. Of course, I am an optimist; I am always hopeful. The reason I had less hope is because of all the economic disintegration, how difficult a transition it is for this nation to move from a totalitarian government, to move from Communist rule to democracy and, indeed, too much economic pain for too many people in the country. 
I will never forget being on the Trans-Siberian Railroad and talking to a woman, I am sorry to say, through a translator and having her say to me, `You can't eat freedom.' 
What I worry about--I don't think this issue is the issue alone, and I know there have been public opinion polls recently taken--I am sure my colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, has spoken about some of that--where a majority, not a large majority, but a majority says they favor NATO expansion. What I worry about is this can be a triggering event if things don't go well. I am worried if things do not go well economically; I am worried if there is a considerable amount of instability, if President Yeltsin should run into difficulty with an illness and should pass away; I am worried about what is going to happen in the future, not in the distant future but in the medium future and maybe in the near future. I do not think the benefits of NATO expansion come close when measured up against what I consider to be the very real dangers of doing this. 
I think we are making a fateful decision. I said in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--I like to say it because my father was my teacher. My father--I miss him, I wish he was alive. I wish he was here to provide me with advice. When I was growing up, I was a little embarrassed by my father because he was very `old country.' He was almost 50 when I was born. He wasn't cool and didn't fit in and really didn't fit in with my friends' parents. When I got to be high-school age, the age of some of the pages here, I realized what a treasure he was. For 3 years before I went away to the University of North Carolina, every night at 10 o'clock, except for the weekends, I would meet him in our kitchen and we would have sponge cake and hot tea, and he would talk about the world. For 3 years, I had a chance to just listen to my father and learn from him. I really believe that my father would say to me today that George Kennan is right and that we will make a fateful decision if we vote for ratification of this NATO agreement. 
Mr. President, it is with strength and feeling very strongly about my position--but nevertheless it is a difficult decision--that I speak today on the floor. I urge my colleagues to oppose ratification of NATO expansion. I shall vote no, though I am hopeful that maybe we will be able to pass some amendment which I think will make a huge difference. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to briefly speak about this vote. 
What has just happened on the floor--and I do take exception to this, especially with the majority leader--is we had the Coverdell bill--I said to Senator Coverdell yesterday that I do not necessarily agree with the bill, but I said to him, `Paul, I look forward to the debate. I am really ready for this debate. I have a lot of amendments; other Senators have prepared amendments. I think this is probably the most important thing we can do in the U.S. Senate is to have a really substantive debate about education.' 
What has now happened is the majority leader filed cloture and said we are not going to have an opportunity over the next 2 days to offer any amendments. The proposal, as I understand it, was that if we would accept some kind of an arrangement where we could offer germane amendments, that would be acceptable, but not necessarily relevant amendments. It is just an outrageous proposition, because the test of germaneness is, if you offer an amendment on the education bill that expands education, expands educational opportunities for children, it is relevant. 
The Presiding Officer has had some very interesting hearings--I have been at those--dealing with early childhood development. If we want to come out with amendments and make the connection between early childhood development and education for children, that would not be viewed as germane. 
I have said to people in Minnesota, based on meetings with community college students and people in my State, `Yes, I will come out here and try to make sure this Hope tax credit will be refundable,' because right now if you come from a family with an income under $27,000 or $28,000 a year, it doesn't help you at all. The very students who need the help in being able to afford higher education--the Coverdell bill was about how to afford either K through 12 or higher education. Many students in Minnesota from working families cannot afford it. That would not meet the germaneness test. 
I have an amendment that deals with this awful problem--I think I can get good support--that too many welfare mothers are not able to complete their 2 years of college. They are told they have to leave school. They are on the path to self-sufficiency. It is a big mistake. It deals with the parent and child. Children do well in school when their parents are able to do well. 
My point is that what has happened, I think, on the floor really is a bit outrageous. We wanted to have a debate on education. I am ready to debate education with my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike. I had amendments; other Senators had amendments. We were ready to bring those amendments out here. From my point of view, I would have agreed to time limits on these amendments. Instead, what has happened is the majority leader has come out, filed cloture, basically is saying he is not going to let us offer any amendments that are relevant and important to children's lives in America. 
Instead, he now moves to NATO. This vote on NATO--I asked for the yeas and nays, the minority leader asked for the yeas and nays--is not about what our position is on NATO. It is about saying we thought we were going to have a debate on education. We thought we were going to have an opportunity as Senators to speak to perhaps the most important issue or set of issues in our States, which has to do with expanding educational opportunities for children and for young people in America. That is what we thought this was about. 
Now what we have seen happen on the floor of the Senate is the majority leader basically comes out, files for cloture and says, `I will only entertain the amendments that are germane.' Do you know what? No one Senator, not even the majority leader, gets to decide before we have the debate what amendments are relevant and important when it comes to expanding educational opportunities for children. I would love to debate the majority leader, I would love to debate members of the Republican Party and Democratic Party on this. It looks right now like we won't have that debate. 
On the Democratic side--I am not the minority leader; he can speak better for Democrats--I think we are going to have unanimity on this and we are going to keep coming back and we are, I say to my colleague from North Dakota, going to insist on a debate. In order to be responsible Senators, in order for the U.S. Senate to be responsible, we should have a substantive, thoughtful, important debate about what we need to do to expand educational opportunities for all of our children. 
That is what this should be about. 
Now we move away from the bill. The idea is, the majority leader says, we will only take the amendments that are germane. That is it. That is not acceptable. That is not acceptable. We will come back over and over and over again and we will have a debate on the Coverdell bill. We should have that debate. I said that to Senator Coverdell yesterday. And it should be a good debate. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I could speak for 3 hours on this. But I agree with Senator Biden from Delaware. This is really one of the situations where words really do matter. I fully support this resolution. I am glad we are speaking out on it. 
Several years ago I had a chance to visit Kosovo. It was really an awe-inspiring trip. I, first of all, wanted to go to the former Yugoslavia--I know Senator Biden visited there--on my own to see what was in the holocaust taking place; at least the genocide. I never could get to Sarajevo. I never could fly in. But I was able to eventually drive from Zagreb to Belgrade. I met with Milosevic. It was really the only meeting I ever had with someone where I wouldn't shake his hand. We were talking about Kosovo. I was about to visit there. He told me that people were very happy there; that I would find out that there had been a tremendous amount of exaggeration. I couldn't believe he said that to me. It was just outright lying. It was unbelievable. 
I went to Kosovo and I met with people who were involved in the nonviolence. As they said then, `We want to do this in a nonviolent way.' But time is not neutral. People can't continue to bear their oppression. People couldn't go to medical school. They couldn't go to law school. There were police everywhere. It was an absolute police state where 90 percent of the Albanian people were oppressed by the Serbs. This is not the best of what the Serb people stand for. Now we have this resistance. Now we have the people in Kosovo who are taking a strong stance. 
I am opposed to terrorism. We are all opposed to terrorism. Murder is never legitimate. But I must say that I think it is important that we get behind this resolution, and I think it is important that Milosevic know that there will be pressure put on him, and that we are serious about trying to support the people of Kosovo. It is very important that we do this. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. 
Mr. President, the bill I offer today will restore food stamps for all legal immigrants who lost eligibility under the 1996 welfare reform law. Representative Guiterrez and I began developing this legislation last fall, and in the second week of March he introduced an identical bill in the House. Today I introduce our legislation in the Senate. 
This bill is more comprehensive than the proposal included by the President in his budget request for FY 1999. I commend the President for making the effort to address this problem, but his proposal does not go far enough. It overlooks 100,000 immigrants who were formerly eligible. It seems to me wholly unreasonable to leave these people out, given their relatively small number. 
I say we must go further. It was a mistake to deny food stamp eligibility in the first place, and now is the time to make amends. The legislation Congressman Gutierrez and I have developed will restore eligibility for all legal immigrants. While the President proposes spending $2.43 billion dollars over the next 5 years, the cost of our bill would be only marginally higher--closer to $3 billion. 
The 1996 welfare bill denied legal immigrants the means to meet basic nutritional needs in order to save some money. But I believe that, in the end, this provision will not save us any money at all. In the long run, we as a society will have to pay this bill, and pay it in full. We will pay with more family conflict, more medical problems, and lower student achievement. The cost of this mistake will far outweigh the money saved. Indeed, I believe we are already paying the price. 
In searching for ways to save money, Congress conveniently chose to target a group of people who do not vote. On one level, it is easy to understand the politics of this decision. But on another level, I find it incomprehensible. Consider how much these hard-working people contribute to our society and our economy. They pay taxes and often perform jobs that American citizens refuse to do. The fact that they have no right to vote should not mean that we single them out for this kind of treatment. 
It was especially irresponsible to deny eligibility knowing that two thirds of those affected would be children. Denying basic nutrition to children is not what this country is about, nor should it be. But that is essentially what Congress did in 1996. An estimated 900,000 legal immigrants lost their eligibility with passage of welfare reform. Another 600,000 children--children who are American citizens but whose parents are legal immigrants--have seen their family's food stamps reduced. Denying nutrition to parents will affect these children. Nutrition is a basic need which, if denied or reduced, has enormous negative effects on a family. This is no way for a country with a proud history of compassion and community to go about reducing the deficit. 
Today I offer legislation that would recognize this mistake and correct it. Ending hunger, whether among legal residents or anybody else, should remain a national responsibility. It cannot be done on a piecemeal basis. As of today, only three states have provided full eligibility for legal immigrants. A total of eleven states are providing coupons or the equivalent for some or all legal immigrants. Two states have set up independent programs to serve some of the legal immigrant population. But each of these thirteen states has the option and ability to change or terminate these commendable efforts at any time. That's not good enough. 
In my own state of Minnesota, food stamp cuts have had a major impact on our immigrant communities. While the state has offered temporary and partial food assistance for legal immigrants to make up for the loss of federal benefits, it has not been enough. Food banks have experienced a noticeable increase in demand for their services, especially in the Hmong and Somali communities. In fact, all across this nation the need for food assistance is on the rise, especially among immigrants. 
We can alleviate at least some of this problem by passing the bill I offer today. I believe we have a responsibility to both the children suffering under this new law who are American citizens, and to the legal immigrants who lost coverage. If we reinstate food stamp eligibility, these immigrants will once again be able to provide adequate nutrition for themselves and for their children. I believe this is what we must do to meet our responsibility, and it is the right thing to do.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me also thank Charlotte Oldhom-Moore who works for me and has been doing just a tremendous amount of work on this piece of legislation. I also thank Ellen Bork who works with Senator Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for all of her fine work. 
Let me list Human Rights Watch, RFK Center for Human Rights, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Minnesota Advocates, International Campaign for Tibet, and Amnesty International for all of their fine work. Their organizing work has been terribly important, and it is an honor for me as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota--and we have a very strong human rights community--to be working with these organizations. 
Mr. President, I will be brief. There may be debate on the other side, and I want to reserve some time to respond and I know there are others who will want to speak. I know Senator Feingold is anxious to get to the floor. If he does not, let me just say that Senator Feingold has been very, very vocal about this and has been a very strong supporter. 
The 16-to-1 vote that Senator Mack spoke about in the Foreign Relations Committee represented full enclosure because several months ago, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hosted a coffee and Wei Jingsheng came. He came up to several of us. I was one of the Senators who he approached. He asked us to please try and adopt a resolution on the floor of the Senate that will call on the administration and our Government at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to please move forward with a resolution condemning the human rights violations in China. 
What Wei and others said to me and Senator Mack was, `Look, you may not always understand, but what you do on the floor of the Senate is watched, especially internationally. If the Senate doesn't speak on this and if the United States Government remains silent, it would be devastating to so many people in China who have had the courage to stand up for human rights, people who face persecution for their religious and political beliefs.' 
I felt then, and I feel even more so now, when someone like Wei is speaking to you, someone who spent 18 years in prison--I read his book, `The Courage to Stand Alone,' someone whom I hope will get the Nobel Peace Prize--and makes such a request, it really feels good to be able to honor that request. 
We have worked hard on this. We wanted to get this on the floor. I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, for absolutely 
living up to his personal commitment to us that we would get this on the floor before the U.N. Commission on Human Rights meets. 
I will just say to colleagues that I think Senator Biden in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said it best the other day. He said, `Look, we have disagreement about whether or not you link human rights concerns and issues to trade policy, but that is not what this is about. If there ever was a place and there ever was a time for our Government to speak up for human rights, and ever since Tiananmen Square a large part of the focus has been about China, it is at this United Nations Commission on Human Rights that convenes in Geneva March 16.' 
We are now on the floor of the Senate--what is today's date?--March 12. We may not be back in session until Monday or Tuesday. It is terribly important that this vote takes place. 
I say to the Chair and I say to all colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, I hope we can get a vote that mirrors the vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The stronger the vote, the stronger the message. 
I say to my colleague from Florida, since we have worked so closely on this, it is interesting that today the State Department announced that China has agreed to an international covenant on civil and political rights. I say great. 
When I mentioned this to Senator Mack earlier, he said, `That's tremendous, let's just make sure now we have a good strong vote to make it crystal clear that we intend to keep pushing forward with the pressure and with a voice in behalf of those women and men who have the courage to speak up in China for what they believe in.' 
I spoke with Sandy Berger last night. I know he is working very hard on this. This is not a bashing amendment, but this is an amendment that says to our Government that to go to Geneva and to not make the effort to push forward this resolution which speaks to the violations of human rights in China, we think it would be silence, we think it would go against the very best of what our country stands for. 
So, I hope there will be a very, very strong vote for this resolution. 
Mr. President, I ask how much time I have.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me say to Senator Feingold that I appreciate his remarks. I also love working with him on a lot of issues. I hope we can do a lot of human rights work together. He has been such a very strong voice on human rights in the Senate. 
Mr. President, one more time, this is an important statement by the Senate. Sometimes these kinds of votes really matter. I think this is one of those times. I hope the President and the administration will pay attention to what I hope will be a very strong vote. I believe they will. I certainly hope so. I hope that our Government will move on a resolution condemning human rights violations in China. I hope that the administration will do everything possible to exact concession here on behalf of human rights for people in China. 
I think it is also very important to a whole lot of people in China who are involved in this struggle and a whole lot of people in Tibet. Sometimes I look at things differently and sometimes what I worry the most about is the effect of inaction over action, noncommitment over commitment on such a question for people who are imprisoned. I have heard stories from my friends in a lot of the human rights organizations, men and women, who have said that the only thing that kept them going while they were in prison was resolutions of this kind. The only thing that kept them going was when our country, our Government, under a President like President Jimmy Carter, who was so focused on human rights, it meant so much to these people. I think this is a terribly important resolution. 
I have often thought to myself when I finish on this, whether it be China or whether it be other countries--and the focus can be and should be and must be on China--I have often wondered and I think I might have the courage to challenge a repressive government if I thought that at worst I could be imprisoned. I don't even know if I would have that courage. But I don't know what I would do if I thought maybe my child could be rounded up and my child could be hurt or my wife could be hurt. There are people throughout the world who stand up to these governments. They stand up to these governments even when they know that this might happen. I marvel at their courage. They inspire me as a U.S. Senator. 
China is a very large country and a very big country. But that does not mean that China should not be held accountable. This is a very important vote we are about to have. 
I will yield back the rest of my time. I thank my colleague from Florida for his leadership and tell him it has been an honor to work with him on this.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to add my voice to those of my colleagues in support of S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) II. This bill is tremendously important to the residents of the state of Minnesota. I want to thank the Manager of the bill for his excellent work in bringing this important legislation to the floor. 
ISTEA represented a comprehensive package to address all transportation needs. I am proud to be able to say that I will support S. 1173 the ISTEA reauthorization bill. This is a good piece of legislation. It continues the fundamental goal of the original ISTEA, which is to afford state and local governments greater flexibility in allocating transportation dollars. Investing in our transportation infrastructure is essential if we are to remain economically competitive. Today, our highways and transit systems need continued support in order to meet our commercial and personal transportation requirements. 
In addition to the `traditional highway advocates'--the city, county and state officials, engineers and contractors--I have been working closely with community organizers, architects, preservationists, bicyclers and community activists. All of these people support ISTEA. I want to thank all of the county commissioners, city and state officials, as well as transit advocates, community organizers and others who have educated me along the way on transportation issues. 
I am pleased to say that the Senate will be passing a very good bill today that will provide a much higher level of funding for the transportation infrastructure and investment in Minnesota. This bill will make over $2 billion available to the state of Minnesota over six years. 
With this funding a continued federal investment will be made in maintaining and expanding Minnesota's highways, transit and other transportation related programs. Not only was the Senate able to increase funding for the traditional highway programs, including bridges, but this bill will also authorize additional funding for transit programs. I am pleased that several transit projects have been proposed in Minnesota including the Twin Cities Transitway. Improving existing transit and building new transit will be crucial as we see our population in the state continue to grow. It is clear that as our region continues to grow we will need alternatives to the traditional car and driver commuting. 
I am also pleased that this bill continues the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. The DBE program, which was first authorized in 1982, has been very successful in my home state of Minnesota. Through the DBE program minority and women owned businesses have grown. Businesses that in the past had been cut out from important highway construction dollars have been able to compete and get contracts to build and maintain our nation's interstate highway system. 
Transportation is critical to our daily lives. We cannot separate how people and goods are transported from the many other parts of their social and economic lives. It is important to work together to ensure that we have a fully integrated, safe and environmentally sound intermodal transportation system in the state of Minnesota and the country. ISTEA does this through the MPO, ATP and STIP process. The planning provisions of the bill put the decision making back at the local level. I am pleased that the Senate bill includes language that I authored to require MPO's to provide meaningful public participation in the MPO process. While the MPO process has worked well, this new language will make the process that much more responsive to the communities that are most impacted by their decisions. 
Again, I am pleased to add my support to this important bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in honor of International Women's Day, I am submitting, along with my colleague Senator Feinstein, legislation to curb a horrific practice: the forced or coerced trafficking of women and girls for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This resolution will effectively put Congress on record as opposing trafficking for forced prostitution and domestic servitude, and acting to check it before the lives of more women and girls are shattered. 
One of the fastest growing international trafficking businesses is the trade in women. Women and girls seeking a better life, a good marriage, or a lucrative job abroad, unexpectedly find themselves forced to work as prostitutes, or in sweat shops. Seeking this better life, they are lured by local advertisements for good jobs in foreign countries at wages they could never imagine at home. 
Every year, the trafficking of human beings for the sex trade affects hundreds of thousands of women throughout the world. Women and children whose lives have been disrupted by civil wars, or fundamental changes in political geography, such as the disintegration of the Soviet Union, have fallen prey to traffickers. The International Organization for Migration has said that as many as 500,000 women are annually trafficked into Western Europe alone. 
Upon arrival in countries far from their homes, these women are often stripped of their passports, held against their will in slave-like conditions, and sexually abused. Rape, intimidation, and violence are commonly employed by traffickers to control their victims and to prevent them from seeking help. Through physical isolation and psychological trauma, traffickers and brothel owners imprison women in a world of economic and sexual exploitation that imposes a constant fear of arrest and deportation, as well as of violent reprisals by the traffickers themselves, to whom the women must pay off ever-growing debts. Many brothel owners actually prefer foreign women--women who are far from help and home, and who do not speak the language--precisely because of the ease of controlling them. 
Most of these women never imagined that they would enter such a hellish world, having traveled abroad to find better jobs or to see the world. Many in their naivete, believed that nothing bad could happen to them in the rich and comfortable countries such as Switzerland, Germany, or the United States. Others, who are less naive but desperate for money and opportunity, are no less hurt by the trafficker's brutal grip. 
One of the most disturbing trends in trafficking is the growing number of young women and children. For various reasons, including the AIDS epidemic, virgins are increasingly in demand and can fetch some of the highest prices in the international sex market. In the most extreme cases, criminals buy and sell children as if these children were mere objects or animals. 
Trafficking rings are run by criminals often operating through nominally reputable agencies. Through entertainment companies, employment or marriage agencies, these criminals mislead and manipulate women. Lack of awareness of complacency among government officials, such as border and consular officers, contribute to the problem. Further, traffickers are rarely punished as official policies inhibit women from testifying against their traffickers, making forced prostitution highly profitable, low risk business ventures. 
Last year, according to a report in the Washington Post, the FBI raided a massage parlor in downtown Bethesda, right next to Congress, right next to Washington, DC. The massage parlor was involved in the trafficking of Russian women into the United States. The eight Russian women who worked there, lived at the massage parlor, sleeping on the massage tables at night. They were charged $150 a week for `housing' and were not paid any salary, only receiving a portion of their tips. 
Gillian Caldwell and her organization, Global Survival Network (GSN), conducted an extraordinary two-year investigation of the growing international transport of Russian women for prostitution. GSN found that trafficking networks in Russia charge women anywhere from $1,500 to $30,000 for their `services' in facilitating documentation, jobs, and transportation. A relationship of debt-bondage is created that the woman can never defeat. 
Fortunately, the global trade in women and children is receiving greater attention by governments and NGOs following the UN World Conference on Women in Beijing. The United Nations General Assembly has called upon all governments to criminalize trafficking, to punish its offenders, while not penalizing its victims. The President's Interagency Council on Women is working hard to mobilize a response to this problem. But, much, much more must be done. 
Recognizing this worldwide problem, my resolution calls upon the State Department and the Department of Justice to increase their efforts to investigate and take action against international sex trafficking, and to report to Congress about their finding and steps taken to curb this problem. Further, it seeks to reduce incidences of trafficking and forced prostitution by making information available to warn at risk women and girls of the potential dangers they may face. Finally, it provides for training of consular officials, incentives for victims to testify against traffickers, and services for victims of trafficking. 
This resolution strengthens the work of the President's Interagency Council on Women, and has the support of a broad array of organizations: Human Rights Watch, Global Survival Network, Ayuda, National Network on Behalf of Battered Immigrant Women, International Human Rights Law Group, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, and the National Council on International Health. 
I would like to thank the above organizations and agencies who helped craft this legislation. We must commit ourselves to ending the trafficking of women and girls and to building a world in which such exploitation is relegated to the dark past. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution, and I urge its timely passage. 
The President tomorrow will sign an Executive order which will also deal with this problem. We will work on passing the resolution, and also to make sure that this translates into legislative action. 
Mr. President, it is absolutely unconscionable that this goes on in the world, including our country. 
I will come to the floor later on with a blown-up map. But this is a sample of routes used to traffic women for prostitution from the Newly Independent States in the former Soviet Union, and all over the world. But also you see an arrow coming to the United States and to a lot of the European countries. It is just unconscionable that this is happening to women and to girls and essentially the international community has turned its gaze away from it. 
It is important that we have cosponsors for this resolution and that we pass this concurrent resolution with an overwhelming vote. I look forward to the Senate and the House of Representatives working with the President on this matter. 
I hope that we will get a strong vote for this resolution by the end of the week, an up-or-down vote, which, if we have a commitment to do so, I hope the administration will take the action on. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me just thank Senator Feinstein for working with me on this resolution.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today is the 39th anniversary of the Tibetan Uprising Day. On March 10, 1959, the Tibetans instigated a massive uprising against the Chinese in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital. It was ruthlessly suppressed by military force. An estimated 80,000 Tibetans were killed, and the Dalai Lama was forced to flee, seeking refuge in India. Every year, on March 10, the Tibetans in exile gather to commemorate the anniversary of this unfortunate day and to protest the continued occupation of Tibet. 
Mr. President, there are demonstrations all across the country which commemorate this day, March 10, 1959. And I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the meaning of today to the people in Tibet and to make a linkage to what we are doing on the floor--again, with Senator Mack from Florida, with Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, with Senator Feingold from Wisconsin. 
By the end of this week, because of the personal commitment of the majority leader, we will have an up-or-down vote on a resolution, or an amendment to a bill, which will call on the President to put the full force of the United States authority behind the resolution which will be critical of or condemn human rights violations in China before the International Commission on Human Rights, which is going to start meeting on March 16. 
I have a letter which was translated into English--but I am going to keep this forever, because I think it is such a great thing--from Wei Jingsheng, which he wrote out in my office on Friday. This is an appeal by Wei, who spent 18 years in prison and had the courage to stand up for what he believes in. He will be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
This is the request to the U.S. Senate to please go on record this week, before the International Commission on Human Rights meets, strongly behind a resolution calling on the President to do what the President has promised to do, calling on the administration to do what they promised to do, which is to move forward on a resolution at this Human Rights Commission in Geneva which will be critical of, or condemn, the human rights in China, including the crushing of the culture and history and the people in Tibet. 
Mr. President, silence on our part would be betrayal. It would be unconscionable. Our country is a great country because we support human rights. We support the freedoms of people. We support the idea that people should not be persecuted because of their religious practices. They should not be persecuted because they have the courage to challenge governments if one of those governments is left, or right, or center. 
I said it yesterday, but I will say it one more time today. I hope we will work with the President. We are going to get a strong vote for this resolution. I hope the President and the administration will do the right thing. I have myself been calling the State Department. I think Secretary Albright wants to move forward on this. I have not had a chance to talk to her. She is, of course, abroad, working on another very important question about what is happening to people in Kosovo--and rightfully so--trying to lead an international effort and making it clear to Milosevic that Serbia cannot with impunity do this to the people in Kosovo. I believe she is a strong advocate on human rights. 
I talked to Strobe Talbott and to Sandy Berger. I have been putting calls in to their offices, and I think it is important that this week the administration come out with a clear position which would be a reasonable position, doing just what the President has said we ought to do. We don't link it to trade agreements, though I think we should. But this is the right place--at this U.N. Human Rights Commission--to be talking about these human rights violations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues a matter before we go back to the ISTEA, or the transportation bill. It concerns a resolution that I think is extremely important. This will be a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we will have a vote on this week, an up-or-down vote, which says that the Senate strongly urges the President, acting through the current representatives of the United States, to make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution criticizing the People's Republic of China for its human rights abuses in China and Tibet at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which convenes March 16. 
Mr. President, last week, on Friday, I was able to discuss this with the majority leader, and he made a commitment--and his word is good, I know that--that on this resolution we will have a separate up-or-down vote. I believe we will have a very strong vote for this. 
Mr. President, I started out working with Senator Mack from Florida. The resolution was a Mack-Wellstone resolution. I know he will be a very strong supporter, as well as Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas, Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, and I think this resolution will receive broad bipartisan support. 
I come to the floor of the Senate to speak for two reasons. One, to again thank the majority leader for his commitment that we will have an up-or-down vote on this specific resolution, and second of all, to make an all-out appeal to the administration, to the President, to the Secretary of State, to Sandy Berger and others. 
The Washington Post had an editorial last week, and I will read relevant paragraphs. 
The immediate issue is whether to sponsor a resolution at the United Nations Commission . . . in Geneva next month [actually this week.] You wouldn't think this would be a tough call. Such a resolution would moderately criticize China's record and call for improvements; it would impose no penalty beyond well-deserved embarrassment. Democracy advocate Wei Jingsheng nevertheless calls the resolution `a matter of life and death' for reform in China. President Clinton explicitly promised, back when he delinked trade and human rights in 1994, that the administration `would step up its efforts' to get such a resolution approved. China's regime remains as oppressive today as it was then. 
Mr. President, I come to the floor to make an appeal to the President, to make an appeal to the administration. I think when we have an up-or-down vote on this resolution, which calls on our country to be a part of an effort to introduce a resolution at this Human Rights Commission meeting on human rights dealing with abuses of human rights in China, we will get a strong vote on the Senate floor--Republicans and Democrats, Democrats and Republicans. We want to work with the administration. I call on the President today to please make a commitment for the United States to play a critically important role. 
I consider one of the finest hours I have spent as a U.S. Senator to be Friday morning with Wei Jingsheng. Wei Jingsheng --I think many Senators and the Presiding Officer knows about Wei Jingsheng--spent 18 years in prison in China for the courage to speak out for democracy, for human rights. Because of tremendous international pressure, he was released from prison--in poor health. But he can never go back to his country again or he would be imprisoned. 
Wei Jingsheng has been nominated by a number of people for the Nobel Peace Prize. He deserves it. He wrote a wonderful book called `The Courage to Stand Alone.' That is what he has done. 
He came to my office and met with a lot of different human rights organizations on Friday. I asked him to please write a letter that I could distribute to colleagues this week about the importance of an up-or-down vote on this resolution specifically dealing with China--which the majority leader has made clear we will be able to do this week. I will just quote from a little bit of the letter he wrote, which has been translated.  
I strongly support the passage of a resolution that solely condemns the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China. And he lists a variety of reasons; I will read a couple. 
If we want to target more than ten countries at the same time, we not only dilute our force, but also strengthen the solidarity of the anti-human-rights alliance and simultaneously increase resistance to our effort. 
Continuing: 
Based on these considerations, I urge those in the Senate who support human rights to take a strategy that stands in opposition to those friends of the Chinese dictatorship. In unity, we can strike against the real leader and supporter of the alliance of anti-human-rights forces--the Chinese Communist government. 
As long as we persist we will succeed--it is simply a matter of time. I know because our endeavor is just. 
Respectfully, Your friend, Wei Jingsheng. 
It is the least we can do, I say to the President, I say to the White House, the least we can do. Whether or not Senators agree or disagree about whether human rights concerns should be linked to trade or not is a separate question from this question. This question is simple. The right place to do this is at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. It is the right time. The President has made a commitment to do so. Now we must follow through on our commitment. 
I urge Senators to please support this resolution. We will have an up-or-down vote on it. I also urge Senators: please, don't dilute this. If we want to pass a resolution calling for respect for human rights in all sorts of other countries--yes, I won't oppose that. As a matter of fact, many of those countries are already on the list and it will be brought up in Geneva. But we also need to have a separate resolution dealing with what is happening in China. 
Mr. President, the administration has already indicated that it will strongly support action on Colombia, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan and many other countries. Significantly, the administration has also publicly supported an international investigation of the situation in Algeria. But the administration has remained undecided on China. 
Like many of you, I support any call for greater action on all governments committing human rights violations. Yes, let's do that. But there are also compelling reasons for the Congress and the administration to issue a stand-alone declaration on China. 
This resolution that I will be introducing on the floor of the Senate with bipartisan support is a stand-alone resolution declaration on China. That has been the focuses of the past several meetings of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. We cannot move away from that focus. This is a compelling moral issue. Our country ought to be there speaking out for human rights for people in China and other countries as well. But this resolution will be the key up-or-down vote. 
Finally, Mr. President, the U.N. Human Rights Commission is the only major international body which oversees the human rights conditions of all the nations. There is no dispute that the credibility of the commission process hinges on whether or not there will be at least a debate on China's human rights record. Few countries have so brazenly challenged the legitimacy of international human rights scrutiny or so openly challenged the universality of human rights as China. It would be shocking, I say to the President, for the United States to respond to this challenge with silence. 
Would it be shocking, I say to the President, the administration, and my colleagues, for us to respond to this challenge with silence? When I meet with somebody like Wei Jingsheng, who has exhibited such courage--and he just asked us to go on record supporting this simple resolution, and I believe it is the very least that we can do. Colleagues, we are going to have a vote on it this week, and I hope that we have an overwhelming, strong, bipartisan voice and message to the President and the administration that the United States will be courageous, that we will live up to our own best selves as to who we are as a Nation, and we will take the lead in Geneva. 
If we let the U.N. Commission on Human Rights meet in Geneva and we are silent and there is not any discussion about religious persecution, the persecution of people because they had the courage to speak out, the crushing of the people in Tibet, and all of the rest, if there isn't even any discussion, it will be devastating for so many courageous people in China that have stood up for human rights. We can't let that happen. Therefore, we will have this up-or-down vote.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am not quite sure what our schedule will be this week, whether we will finish up on the ISTEA highway bill or not, and that is an important piece of legislation. I think all of us know that people in our States anxiously await the Senate to move forward on this business. It sounds like the next piece of legislation we may have will be a piece of legislation introduced by Senator Coverdell from Georgia which deals with education and children. 
I won't get into all of the specifics. We will have plenty of debate on that matter. I wanted to just mention to colleagues that there are several amendments that I want to bring to the floor that I think are very relevant to what we need to do by way of responding to the concerns and circumstances of children. Let me preface this by saying to colleagues that I think one of the things we have to start doing as legislators, as Senators, one of the things we have to start doing on the floor of the Senate, is to have more of a focus on children. We have given enough speeches to deafen all the gods, and there have been enough reports. 
The question is, what are we going to do by way of movement forward with positive action that will help children in our country--all of the children in our country? 
I find myself, as I speak on the floor of the Senate today, critical of, I guess, both of our parties. One would think from the pronouncements we hear all the time that everybody is doing great in the United States of America today, that everything is humming along just fine, everybody is happy, everybody is satisfied. Yet, when I travel the country--and I go into a lot of different communities--I don't find that at all. 
I am glad that the economy is doing well in the aggregate. I am glad unemployment is at record low levels, though it doesn't tell us what jobs and what wages. I am glad the GDP looks good and that the business cycle is up. But can I raise the question, since we are going to move to education and children, how do we explain the fact that during this business cycle, with Republicans and Democrats talking about how great things are, we have one out of every four children under the age of 3 growing up poor in America, and one out of every two children of color under the age of 3 growing up poor in America? And we are now saying that these early years are the most important years for these children in determining whether or not they are going to have the opportunity to reach their full potential. We have our work cut out for us, and I hope we will respond. So far we haven't. 
So when this legislation comes out, I want to just mention a couple of amendments that I am thinking about. One of them speaks to the question I just raised indirectly, but I think it's important. As I travel the country, I am amazed--and I was speaking with a gathering of community college students who have focused on this as well--that in the name of `welfare reform,' we are now saying to many single parents--most of them women, and many of them in our community colleges--they have to leave school and take a job. In other words, this is the bitter irony: They are on the path to economic self-sufficiency and yet we are telling many of these parents, these women, `You have to leave college; you can't complete your education; you must take this job, because these are the work force participation requirements.' It may be a $6-an hour-job 
with no benefits; and a year from now they are without health care coverage, they are worse off than they are now, as are their children. 
That is outrageous. So I am going to have an amendment for student exemption for these adults who are in school trying to complete their education so they can reach economic self-sufficiency, so that any State that wants to can at least say, look, we want to exclude these parents who are in school from the work force participation requirement. That makes a lot of sense if we are interested in these mothers and children being able to do better. 
The second question I want to raise for colleagues is--and I don't know if this will be an amendment on this bill or not, but as long as we are talking about education, which is what we are going to do with the Coverdell bill, and trying to do better for children--how come we cut food stamp benefits by 20 percent? The majority of the beneficiaries are children from families making under $7,500 a year. 
As I travel around the country, it all has to do with the questions you ask. It all has to do with whether you are willing to listen. It all has to do with what communities you are willing to visit. I find a lot of teachers telling me that a lot of their students can't do well because they come to school hungry. Why in the world did we cut the major safety net program for the working poor, the primary recipients, by 20 percent by the year 2002? I think we need to revisit that question. 
Mr. President, there is another issue that I want to raise that may be an amendment, or may not be, which is that it is impossible to focus on education and children doing well without focusing on the adults or the adult. The two variables--to wear a kind of political science hat for a moment--that have had the greatest impact, or the two primary causes of whether a child does well in school or not, the two most important factors--that is the word I am struggling for--are the educational attainment and the income status of the parent or parents. 
Well, if that is the case, I think we ought to start asking the question, if we are looking at the learning gap in our country and what children do well and what children don't do well, what about so many of these communities--and William Julius Wilson, a great sociologist, has written about this in his book called `The Disappearance of Work'--what about these communities where there are no jobs, even with the economy humming along as it is? What about many of the ghettos and barrios in rural areas where there are no jobs, and the parents or parent can't find employment, can't find a job at a decent wage? What is the connection between the economic status, the job status of the parent or parents, and the educational achievement of the children? 
I think that, at the very minimum, we ought to ask labor and the Department of Education to do a study of this and come back and provide us with some evidence. I will tell you that I think we will find a very strong correlation. And I will tell you that I am all for work. In fact, I think the most important policy goal is to make sure that when people in America work full-time, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they are not poor. I can think of a variety of different things we ought to do to make sure that happens. We also ought to look in a lot of communities where people live where there are no jobs at all, nor is there transportation to get into the suburbs where those jobs do exist. 
I say to my colleagues, this is not just an urban issue; this is a big rural issue as well. I look forward to when the Coverdell bill comes out to the floor. I look forward to the debate and discussion. 
I see my colleague from Missouri on the floor. I don't want to take any more time. Before Senator Ashcroft takes the floor, I was talking about the importance of getting a resolution on China, urging the administration and the U.N. Commission on Human Rights that we ought to take a position on the violation of human rights in China. I know my colleague is a strong supporter. I say to my colleague that we are going to have tremendous support on an up-or-down vote. I am urging the administration today to please move forward. That was the other agenda item for me. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I will be really very brief. 
I have been involved in negotiations, as all of us are, on this legislation, all of us trying to use our leverage to fight for what we think is right. I have been very focused on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution amendment which I think will command widespread support from both Democrats and Republicans. 
I know, for example, that this resolution was initially something I did with Senator Mack, who still strongly supports it--Senator Hutchinson, and many, I hope the Chair. 
This is just a sense-of-the-Senate resolution--could be amendment; I hope it would be a separate resolution, but one way or the other--that, basically, strongly urges the President, acting through the permanent representatives of the United States--and I am just looking at this; I will quote his record--`to make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution criticizing the People's Republic of China for its human rights abuses in China, Tibet at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.' 
Mr. President, the point is that I am not going to get into any sharp debate or attack people who are not here right now, but I think the point of this resolution, the amendment, is to make sure that we take some action before the United Nations Commission on Human Rights convenes in Geneva, which would be on March 16. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take up this resolution, I think, on Thursday, but my concern, as a U.S. Senator who feels strongly about this, about human rights questions and has worked closely with a number of really great people in these human rights organizations--and I tell you, in some ways, one of the biggest thrills of my life has been to have a chance to work with Wei Jingsheng, who was just in the office and who is very focused in on this. 
In any case, what I wanted to make sure of is--and I think many Republicans agree with us--that the Foreign Relations Committee meets, but that still does not guarantee that we have a resolution or amendment on the floor by the end of next week or as soon as possible. And really next week is the critical timeframe that we are talking about. 
We have gone back and forth on other resolutions that were going to be introduced. I know Senator Specter has one he wants to do on Iraq. My position is, well, then there ought to be one on China. 
In any case, I think it is no longer necessary for me to do anything on the floor of the Senate. I have a commitment by the Senate majority leader, Senator Lott. It is a personal commitment, not an official, formal commitment. I think it is all I need. I think most of us know, if he gives his word, his word is good. 
So, I feel very confident that we, indeed, will be able to deal with this resolution in this timeframe, which is so important that really the voice of the Senate be heard, the voice of the Congress be heard. And certainly I hope the voice of the President and the administration will be heard before the Human Rights Commission convenes in Geneva. 
So I thank colleagues for working with me. I certainly thank the majority leader for being sensitive and working this out. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Tennessee and others in introducing the `Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998,' as an original cosponsor. This bill reauthorizes funding to extend and enhance many fine programs at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I am pleased to join in this important effort. 
Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Frist for his work in developing this legislation to strengthen and expand Federal efforts to promote women's health. While there is still some work to be done to improve the bill as it moves through the normal legislative process, I believe this bill offers a good start and provides a solid foundation on which to build historic improvements in NIH research programs on breast cancer, heart attack, menopause, and other areas. Let me outline briefly a few critical issues that are not addressed by the bill, but which I hope to see addressed as we move forward. 
One notable gap is in the area of substance abuse. I believe this bill could be an important complement to the Substances Abuse Treatment Parity Act (S. 1147), which I introduced last September to improve access to equitable medical care to treat the disease of alcohol and other drug dependencies. Substance abuse is a widespread health concern for many women, who also experience associated health, psychological, and family problems. For example, expectant mothers and mothers with small children can be helped with treatment and support services. This is an investment for them, but as importantly for their children, who would have the opportunity to grow up in a healthy, chemical-free home environment. We have to take the problem of substance abuse as seriously as we do other aspects of women's health. 
Important information about this national problem will be highlighted in an upcoming five-part PBS series by Bill Moyers, where treatment programs such as the Hazelden program in my state of Minnesota are highlighted. In working with these and other treatment programs in Minnesota, I have learned a great deal about the problems of substances abuse, but also about the hope and success that occurs when effective treatments are available. The Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments Act could be substantially improved by an additional focus on substance abuse programs. 
Another notable gap is in the area of mental health and behavioral science. On page one of the New York Times today was an article on the criminalization of mental illness. The problem is that we as a nation have needed to focus on the humane, dignified treatment of mental illness, and having failed in that, more and more people who are suffering from mental illness are winding up in prisons where they are out of sight, but where they are not getting the care they need. We need to treat mental health as seriously as we treat cancer and heart disease, because mental illness can be just as serious, chronic, and life-destroying as other diseases. 
I intend to work closely with Senator Frist and others on the committee to improve the bill by including a recognition of the role that behavioral science and psychological factors have in the development of and recovery from disease. Many of the diseases mentioned in the bill are scientifically linked to behavioral or psychological factors that can be critical to prevention and recovery. Women also suffer unduly from specific mental health problems and experiences, such as depression and domestic violence. Depression, for example, is a pervasive and impairing illness which affects women at roughly twice the rate of men. Domestic violence places a significant resource and economic strain on our justice, health, and human services systems. Research conducted at urban hospitals has show that about 25% of emergency room visits by women resulted from domestic assaults. Women who have been raped or battered have significantly great physical health problems, as well as increased vulnerability to psychological and emotional suffering. My wife Sheila and I have worked for years to improve the federal response to the epidemic levels of domestic violence across the country; I want to make sure this bill adequately addresses these issues. 
Mr. President, it is my commitment to work closely with the committee to enhance these and other areas that are critical to women's health. A strong focus on research and prevention of mental illness and substance abuse for women is an important investment in the health of the nation and of the health and well being of countless families.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will keep it very simple. As a Senator from Minnesota, I rise in strong support of this Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program, what we are calling the DBE program. For people who are watching, if you didn't catch it, it is Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program. 
This program sets out a goal of 10 percent of the highway construction funds. The attempt is to make sure that 10 percent of these funds go to disadvantaged businesses, and the focus is on `minority businesses' and businesses owned by women. 
My State of Minnesota has essentially had the equivalent of this program since 1980. One of the reasons I am really proud of being a Senator from Minnesota is I think we have a really strong, progressive, justice tradition. In the last 5 years, Minnesota Department of Transportation has exceeded the 10 percent goal. We have been between about 11 and 13 percent for contracts that have gone out to `minority'-owned businesses and to women-owned businesses. 
Mr. President, the important point to make for colleagues is that these businesses have been able to win these contracts because of a level playing field. It has enabled them to get their foot in the door. They haven't been able to obtain these contracts because they have a bid that comes in higher than other contractors. Other things have to be equal. They don't get these contracts because they do shoddy work. It is because these are effective businesses that do good work. What you have is a situation where around the 
country we have made the argument through this Disadvantage Business Enterprise Program, we are serious about entrepreneurship. 
We think it is indeed better that the people who make the capital investment decisions in the communities we live in are people who own businesses and live in those communities, not people who make decisions over martinis halfway across the world. We are not talking about big multinational corporations. 
Insofar as we are focused on our local economies and insofar as we are talking about entrepreneurship, I will tell you, as a member of the Small Business Committee, I have loved working on these issues. I am not ashamed to say that small businesses have been my teachers. I was a teacher, a college teacher. I never owned a small business, and I have learned a lot about what it takes to do so. But it is absolutely true that most of the growth in our economy is in the small business sector. 
It is absolutely true that if we want to expand opportunities and if we don't want to turn our gaze away from an unpleasant reality, which is that we still have discrimination in our country--does anybody believe that America is blind to issues of race? Does anybody believe that we have conquered all of this? Does anybody believe that we don't want to try and redress some major historical grievances? That is what we are doing through this program. 
It does just what the title says--it is the disadvantaged business enterprise program. It sets a goal of 10 percent of highway money going to these contractors which are owned by minorities and women. It has been enormously successful in the State of Minnesota. We exceed that goal. It enables people to get their foot in the door, start their businesses, and then they become successful in a whole lot of other areas as well. 
I think then you have this kind of marriage between, on the one hand, trying to expand opportunity, on the other hand trying to correct a historical injustice, and--although there are only two hands--on the third hand, also being serious about promoting entrepreneurship, also being serious about making sure that women and people of color in our communities are able to obtain some of the funding that comes out of these contracts. 
Instead, it will be a close vote. I hope we win. I think we should win. I do not believe that the U.S. Senate ought to be turning the clock back 30 years. I think we should be moving forward. I think a vote which would eliminate this program, the DBE program, would be an enormous step not forward for expanding opportunities, not forward for promoting entrepreneurship, not forward for women and minorities having these opportunities, it would be a giant leap backward. 
That is why I come to the floor to speak in behalf of this program.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today to add my voice to those of my colleagues, Senators Lautenberg and DeWine, in support of this amendment to require states to pass .08 blood alcohol content (BAC) laws. 
People who drive while they are impaired are placing all of us in harm's way. The real issue is whether or not a person should be driving after consuming alcohol. There is no good reason that this should be accepted as a standard practice in our society. 
Opponents to this amendment will argue such things as `this means that a 120-pound woman could not drive after drinking two glasses of wine'. I believe they are missing the point. The point is that if a person is impaired by alcohol, he or she should not be driving--period. The point is that someone's BAC might reach .08 after consumption of a certain amount of alcohol, and that BAC level might just be indicative of physical impairment that would affect driving ability. We are not talking about someone being fallen-down drunk, but perhaps a young woman whose reaction time might be slowed, so that as a young child darts out into the street in front of her car, she is unable to react quickly, enough to hit the brakes in time to stop the car from hitting the child. Was this woman `drunk'? No, but the alcohol in her body slowed her reaction time. 
Here are some facts from the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcohol Abuse at NIH that help to explain the issue: 
The brain's control of eye movements is highly vulnerable to alcohol. In driving, the eye must focus briefly on important objects and track them as they and the vehicle being driven move. BAC's of .03 to .05 can interfere with these eye movements. 
Steering is a complex task in which the effects of alcohol on eye-to-hand reaction time are super-imposed upon the effects on vision, studies have shown that significant impairment in steering ability may begin at a BAC as low as .04. 
Alcohol impairs nearly every aspect of information processing by the brain. Alcohol-impaired drivers require more time to read a street sign or to respond to a traffic signal than unimpaired drivers. Research on the effects of alcohol on performance by both automobile and aircraft operators shows a narrowing of the attention field starting at a BAC of approximately .04. 
The National Public Services Research Institute reports the following: 
Approximately 10 percent of miles driven at BAC's of .08 and above are at BAC's between .08 and .10. Every year, crashes that involve drivers at BAC's of .08 to .99 kill 660 people and injure 28,000. 
Driving with a BAC of .08 is very risky. They estimate that crash costs average $5.80 per mile driven with a BAC of .10 or higher, $2.50 a mile for a BAC between .08 and .99, and only 11 cents a mile for each mile driven while sober. 
The preliminary evaluation of the .08 legislation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicates that this law will reduce alcohol-related fatalities by 5 to 8 percent. This is at least comparable to the impact of other laws such as zero tolerance for youth, administrative license revocation or graduated licensing. 
The evidence is clear. There is no good argument against the .08 legislation. In fact, responsible alcohol distributors and manufacturers should favor it. There is no excuse not to implement a law that could decrease traffic fatalities by 600 each year, and decrease traffic-related injuries by many thousands. We need to be responsible and encourage the implementation of .08 legislation in all states, and to provide incentive for doing so. 
Mr. President, again, I want to add my voice to my colleagues, Senator Lautenberg and Senator DeWine, and support this amendment to require States to pass the .08 blood alcohol content law. 
Mr. President, people who drive while they are impaired are placing all of us in harm's way. That is really the issue. Now, opponents of this amendment have argued that this is going to mean such a thing as, `A 120-pound woman could not drive after drinking two glasses of wine.' I believe they miss the point. The point is, if a person is impaired by alcohol, he or she should not be driving, period. 
There are some important facts laid out by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse. It lays out clearly why this amendment is so important. The evidence is really clear. There is no good reason and no good argument to be against this .08 legislation. In fact, responsible alcohol distributors and manufacturers should favor it. 
There is no excuse not to implement a law that could decrease fatalities by 600 each year and decrease traffic-related injuries by many thousands. We need to be responsible, and we need to encourage the implementation of the .08 legislation in all States and to provide those States incentives for doing so. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. President, on a personal note, I want to thank Minnesota Mothers Against Drunk Driving for all that they have done to educate all of us in my State, including me as a Senator. I have been at their gatherings, and I say to my 
colleague, Senator Lott, I absolutely accept what he says in the best of faith. I know he is committed to the general concept. But I believe, after spending time with these families who have lost so many loved ones in these accidents, that we ought to be as tough as possible. This is a matter of public health. We ought to make sure that we have as few people driving who are impaired from alcohol as possible around our country. This is an issue for our national community. This is a matter of public health. This is protection for families in our country. This is the right thing to do. I hope we get a strong majority vote for this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, let me thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his graciousness. For those who might be watching this proceeding, my colleague could have just simply tabled this amendment. He didn't do that. He will eventually, but he has given me an opportunity to respond to his arguments. I want him to know that I appreciate it. 
Mr. President, I won't spend a lot of time on the question of this amendment on the ISTEA bill--which is essentially the highway bill for highways and, hopefully, more mass transit--because, as my colleagues know, Democrats and Republicans alike, we look for vehicles whereby we can come out and introduce amendments that really speak to what we think are some real concerns in the 
country. All of us do that all of the time. I am doing it now. I am not so sure there will be, I say to my colleague, a welfare bill that will be before the U.S. Senate any time soon. I introduce this amendment with some sense of urgency. I don't think there is any evidence whatever that we will have a welfare bill before the U.S. Senate. So if I am going to have an opportunity to make an appeal to my colleagues, now is the time to do so. 
Second, I want to just make it clear what this amendment does and what it does not do. I am puzzled by the opposition, with all due respect to my colleague from Rhode Island. This amendment just simply says to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, please give us a report based upon--not your going out and collecting all sorts of other data--but based upon the data that is available to you. 
My colleague just said that there will be some good data available. Most people that I know--I have a social science background--that have looked at this are saying you have a number of different people studying a number of different things and it is fragmented and does not focus on the main question I am asking. Exactly how many of the families are reaching economic self-sufficiency? This amendment just says to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, please pull together the data that is available, reports prepared by the Comptroller General, samples of the Bureau of Census, surveys funded by your own department, studies conducted by States, studies conducted by nongovernment organizations, and administrative data from other Federal agencies. Please bring that data together, coordinate that data and provide reports to us every 6 months as to exactly how many families are reaching economic self-sufficiency. The goal of that being to answer the question, Are these families now at 150 percent of poverty? Are they over poverty? What kind of jobs do they have? What kind of wages? Where are the children? Is child care available? How are people doing on transportation? Are they able to get to work? Have we had situations where people couldn't take jobs in rural areas because they couldn't get to the jobs? Have we had situations where people don't take jobs in the suburbs and metro areas because they couldn't get from ghettos to suburbs because of lack of transportation? 
That is all this amendment calls for. That is all this amendment calls for. 
So I say to my colleagues that, in a way, I think those that oppose this amendment are trying to have it both ways. On the one hand, they are arguing that we have already collected all of this data. I think not, but if so, it's hardly an onerous requirement to say to the Secretary: Please assemble this data and give us a report every 6 months as to what is really happening out there in the country. 
If the opposition to my amendment--which I have heard from some people on the other side--is, `Wait a minute, you are going to be asking the Secretary for too much,' I say eventually we are going to get to the point where there is going to have to be more of an investment. Because if the Secretary isn't going to be able to provide us with the data we need, with the report we need, based upon the data out there, then I say to you we will need more. That is all the more reason to go forward with this. 
So I am puzzled by the opposition. `We already have these studies that are providing us with the information we need,' they say. So what is the harm in having the Secretary present reports to us every 6 months so we can have some reassurance that these mothers, these single parents, have now been able to obtain employment that they can support their family on, and the children aren't home alone, and first graders don't go home alone after school, and more children aren't impoverished? Why in the world, if we already have the studies out there, would we not want to ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide us with this report? 
If, on the other hand, the basis of the opposition is what I think it is--because I think this is the case--is that this is already being done, as a matter of fact what's being done is pretty fragmented. There is good work being done. Senator Moynihan would be the first to say that we can do better, and that is what this amendment says. Let's ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take the additional studies that are out there--and my colleague talked about some of them--and provide us with the report. If she cannot really provide us with the information we need, then we will cross that bridge when we come to it. I am not mandating that she has to provide additional information. I am saying what would be helpful to us, asking her to please bring together the data that is out there, based on these reports, and give us a report on the current situation. That is what this amendment is all about. 
Now, after having said that, I would make an appeal to my colleagues. I think on our side, I know Senator Baucus is going to support the amendment. On our side I think there is pretty strong support for this. I hope there will be support for this on the other side as well. I think the Senator from Rhode Island--we all have these great things to say about other people and half of it may be true--is a great Senator. I wanted to get his support. I am disappointed because I don't understand what the harm is in this amendment. 
With all due respect, you can get into all this language that sounds kind of impersonal and kind of cold like, `We already have studies, we don't need it,' or `It is going to require us to obtain additional information, which might cost more money,' and `Somebody is going to have to make the investment.' 
Well, Mr. President, imagine just for a moment, just ponder this question: What if I'm right? 
Maybe other Senators have traveled the country. I think I have done as much travel as any other Senator in this Chamber, at least in poor communities, low-income communities. I think I have tried to stay as close to this as any other Senator. I am telling you that in a whole lot of communities it is crystal clear that people live in communities where the jobs aren't there. And in a whole lot of situations--and you will have a lot of people from your States who will tell you the same thing--these women are obtaining jobs, but they hardly pay a living wage. And one year 
from now, or whatever, when they no longer receive medical assistance, their families are going to be worse off. 
I am hearing from a lot of States, including my own State of Minnesota, which has a very low unemployment level and which is doing well economically. I am not here to bash States, but there are studies that raise a whole lot of questions, and there have been some articles that have raised a whole lot of questions about situations where some women haven't shown up for orientation sessions, and sometimes for good reason, and it's said that they don't necessarily want to work. There are communities that have incredibly long waiting lists. The city of Los Angeles had a waiting list of 30,000 for affordable child care before the welfare bill. 
Now, look, if I am right about this, if I am right that what has happened--because all too often we know what we want to know and we don't know what we don't want to know--all too often, what is going on here is, we say there are 4 million fewer recipients, a 4 million reduction in the welfare rolls. The reform is a huge success, but that doesn't mean we have seen a reduction of poverty. I am just saying, should we not know what the situation is in the country? Should we not know what kind of jobs, what wages, the child care situation, and should we not know whether these families are better off or worse off? Should we not know all of that, especially since built into that legislation is a date certain whereby, depending on the State, families will be eliminated from all assistance, the assumption being that all these people are now working and can support themselves and their children. Is that assumption valid? 
Now, why in the world, I say to my colleagues, would you oppose this amendment? Why would you oppose this amendment? 
One final time. This amendment just asks the Secretary of Health and Human Services to please provide to us a report based on the existing studies with data that is out there, on what the situation is around the country, on how many of these families are reaching economic self-sufficiency. Are they out of poverty now? Are their children better off? That's what we want. Or are more families impoverished? Are the jobs just minimum wage? Is there a lack of child care? Is the transportation available or not? Why would we not want to know that? 
You know, I didn't mention this earlier, Mr. President, but there is another amendment I will bring out here on the higher ed bill. I wonder if my colleagues know this. In all too many States, single parents who are in school and community colleges are now being told they have to leave college to take a job. Now, here are the parents that are on the path to economic self-sufficiency. They are in school. They are trying to complete their college education so they can get a good job and support their families. They are being told that, because of the welfare reform bill, they can't complete their education. Talk about something that is shortsighted and harsh, something that is myopic. Well, that is another story and another amendment later on. 
But for now, please support this amendment. Please ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide us with the data. Please, colleagues, at least let's have a focus on this, let's have the information before us, let's know what is going on, let's make sure that these women and children are doing better. That would make us more responsible policymakers. 
Finally, I say to my colleague, if it doesn't pass--and I hope it will--this is an amendment on ISTEA, but I will come back with these amendments over and over again. Because it is my firm belief as a U.S. Senator that we can't turn our gaze away from this. These are citizens who are not the heavy hitters, these are citizens that are not the givers, these are citizens that do not have the lobbyists. These are, in the main, poor people--mainly women and children. I think it is important that we understand what is happening to them, and it is important that we have the right information, and it is important that we do our very best to be responsible policymakers and make sure that these families aren't worse off and that these children are not in harm's way. How in the world, colleagues, can you vote against the proposition that we ought to have as much information as possible before us so that we make sure these children are not endangered, so that we can make sure these families are better off? 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be on the floor at 11 o'clock with an amendment to the ISTEA legislation, but let me pick up on comments I made yesterday on the floor of the Senate about a resolution that Senator Mack from Florida and I have submitted dealing with the whole question of human rights in China.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the immediate issue, as the Post editorial points out, is whether or not the United States is going to sponsor a resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights gathering in Geneva, which is going to be coming up, I think, this month, or maybe at the beginning of next month, but within a very short period of time. 
I had a chance to meet with Wei Jingsheng who wrote a wonderful book called `The Courage to Stand Alone.' He spent many years in prison in China, I think 16 years, for his courage to speak out. He has made it very clear, and I quote the Post editorial, that the resolution is `a matter of life and death' for reform in China. President Clinton explicitly promised, back when he delinked trade and human rights in 1994, that the administration `would step up its efforts' to get such a resolution approved.' 
Mr. President, China remains as oppressive today as it was a few short years ago. I want colleagues to know that this is a separate question from whether or not you were in favor of most-favored-nation status for China. Some people believe trade policy is too blunt an instrument to be focused on human rights. Others do not. I do not share that sentiment. Regardless, let me repeat for colleagues what we know. 
The State Department's own human rights report, which has been somewhat controversial because some think it is a bit of a whitewash this year, still nevertheless paints a dismal picture of China's `widespread and well-documented human rights abuses': 
These include torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, crackdowns on independent Catholic and Protestant bishops and believers, brutal oppression of ethnic minorities and religions in [countries like] Tibet . . . 
And the list goes on. 
Just this month, the FBI arrested two Chinese citizens for allegedly marketing human organs harvested from some of the 6,000 prisoners China executes each year. If prisoners are being killed in order to provide organs, it `would be among the grossest violations of human rights imaginable,' Stanley O. Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, said last summer. 
We haven't yet heard from the White House as to whether or not they are going to be sponsoring a resolution which would raise all of these questions. I think this is a commitment we have made as a country. 
Let me conclude by reading the last paragraph of this Post editorial: 
It may be too late now for the United States to rally a coalition of countries that would guarantee a fair hearing for a resolution on China, but it is not too late for Mr. Clinton to support such a measure nevertheless. He can still send a message that America supports, or at least sympathizes with, the fighters for freedom inside China; alternatively, he can send a message that his friendship with their oppressors is too important to put at risk with any impolite words. For someone who hopes to become this year the first president to visit China since the massacre at Tiananmen Square, this should be an easy choice. 
The resolution that Senator Mack and I submitted yesterday calls on the President to move forward with this resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, which is going to be meeting in Geneva. My understanding was that we were going to mark up this resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, but one Senator on the committee has basically blocked that and has exercised his prerogative so we won't be able to mark it up in committee. 
I want to make it clear to colleagues that I have every intention--and I hope I will be joined by other Senators--of bringing this resolution to the floor as an amendment on a bill, probably the ISTEA bill. I will wait and see and work, of course, very closely with my colleague Senator Mack. 
It is extremely important that the U.S. Senate go on record 
supporting a resolution passed by this U.N. Commission on Human Rights at its meeting in Geneva. Sometimes I get the feeling that when I speak on the floor of the Senate--in a few minutes we will have a debate, there will be more people here--but when I am on the floor of the Senate and speaking about something like this, I sometimes get the feeling it is unimportant. It is not unimportant. When Wei Jingsheng who spent all those years in prison, when Harry Wu, and others, who have given up years of their life because of their courage to speak up for just basic human rights, call on us in the U.S. Senate, `Won't you please at least adopt a resolution'--I guess it is going to have to be an amendment now--`which really calls on the President and your country to take leadership at this U.N. Commission on Human Rights and have some criticism of what has been going on in China, the torture of people, the execution of people, the imprisonment of people just for speaking up, the persecution of religious groups, won't you at least do that,' I am telling you, when I get a request from someone like Wei Jingsheng, who I think is a giant, then I am certainly going to follow through on it. 
I believe that in the U.S. Senate there will be overwhelming support for this resolution, which I think now will be an amendment since we have been blocked from being able to mark it up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
I guess I will say to colleagues, if you don't agree that our country at the very least ought to be speaking up on these human rights questions and supporting people like Wei Jingsheng, that that is at least the minimum we can do at this very important U.N. Commission on Human Rights, then you can come to the floor of the Senate and you can debate it. 
From my own point of view, one Senator, who happens to be my colleague from Minnesota who doesn't agree and is not going to let this go forward on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I would be pleased to debate him and other Senators as well. But my hope is that we will have overwhelming support for this. 
Again, this doesn't say you are for or against most-favored-nation status. This doesn't say you are for or against assistance for IMF or not. This is not about GATT. This is not about NAFTA. This is about something else which we ought to have a consensus on, which is, at this upcoming meeting in Geneva--I think our Government has given people in China every reason to believe that we would--and I guess I will quote Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's famous phrase, `Tell it like it is.' We ought to tell it like it is. We ought to tell it like it is. The Post editorial is right on the mark, we ought to do it at this very important meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. That is the time for the United States to speak out. 
Silence is betrayal, and our country must not be silent in the face of these kinds of abuses of elementary human rights of citizens in China and, for that matter, in other countries as well. 
I hope that I will be doing this on the floor with Senator Mack. I certainly am going to be bringing an amendment to the floor. We have to have a vote on this. I can't let one Senator block a committee from marking up this bill and then have it delayed a month, which will be too late for this U.N. Commission on Human Rights. We will take action on it before the Senate. I hope we get 98, 99 Senators voting in favor of it. It is the least we can do. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me give my colleagues a bit of background on this amendment--some context. I am, if you will, changing the conversation. We are going to be getting into ISTEA amendments soon, and I will have some other amendments on ISTEA. But this is a vehicle out here on the floor and this is a time for me to raise another question, which I think is a very important one. This amendment would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report on the number of former welfare recipients, recipients of public assistance under the State Temporary Assistance to Needy Families programs, who are economically self-sufficient. In other words, what we want to do is have some clear understanding about what is going on in the country right now. 
When we debated the welfare bill, I had an amendment which said something like: Let's please get Health and Human Services to take a look at what is going on in the country. And if it should be the case--and I certainly hope it will not be the case--that, as opposed to families being moved from welfare to work with more economic self-sufficiency, which is what our goal is, we are seeing families that are actually becoming more impoverished, children becoming more impoverished, then what we need to do is take corrective action. Let's at least monitor what is happening. That amendment was defeated. 
What I am saying to colleagues today is that by passing that piece of legislation, we have a certain responsibility to make sure that we know what is going on throughout the country. Gunnar Myrdal, a Swedish sociologist, once said that ignorance is never random. I think we have to be very careful that we at least make an effort, as responsible policymakers, to understand what is happening. 
What I mean by `economic self-sufficiency' is we just need to know whether or not, as the rolls drop--and we have heard reports about how the welfare rolls have dropped by 4 million--whether this reduction in the rolls or reduction in welfare caseload is a reduction of poverty. It can't be viewed as reform unless we are talking about a reduction of poverty. We just need to know whether or not these parents, mainly women, are now working at jobs that provide them a decent wage. The operational indicator that I have in this amendment is we need to know whether or not these families are at 150 percent of poverty. Are they now out of poverty? We need to know whether or not there is child care available for the children. We need to know what the housing situation is. We need to know whether or not there is transportation available for people so they can get to jobs. We just do not know that. 
What I am saying in this amendment is, at the very minimum--and I hope there will be support for it--we ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services, based upon the data that she has--some reports from States, some Census Bureau survey statistics, some agency data--to pull together all the available data--someone has to do that--and provide to the Senate, to the Congress, a report 4 months from enactment of this amendment, and then every 6 months, as to what is going on in the country--whether or not these families are reaching economic self-sufficiency. 
Let me talk a little bit about some of my own travel, and why I bring this amendment to the floor, and also just let me draw from some documentation, empirical data, that I think will help colleagues as they make up their minds. 
This is very reasonable. This is very reasonable, Democrats and Republicans. The only thing I am saying is, please let us know. 
Now, when I travel around the country--and I have spent some time in low-income communities--I am not just focused on welfare. Personally, I think the most important policy goal for us is to make work pay. I think if people work almost 52 weeks a year and almost 40 hours a week, they ought not be poor in America. 
I think some of that is skills development for people who are looking for work. Some of that is access to capital, especially for small businesses, whether it be in Kansas or Minnesota, so we can have more entrepreneurs and have more economic opportunities. And some of that is affordable child care and affordable health care. If you can put that package together, that is probably the best single thing you can do for families in America, especially families, if you will, in the bottom 50 percent of the population. 
I hope that is the direction we will go. But as I travel the country--from Delta, MS, to East LA, Watts, to the Pilsin neighborhood in South Side Chicago, to public housing projects, the Ida Wells housing project, to the Robert Taylor Holmes housing project, to inner city Baltimore, to inner city Minneapolis, to rural Aitkin County, to Letcher County, Appalachia, eastern Kentucky--what I find is a bit of a disturbing picture. And I have been trying to check with people in other States. 
I am finding another thing. First of all, what I do when I travel around the country is say, OK, now you have seen a drop in caseload and you have fewer people on welfare. That is being applauded. But can you tell me where they are? Where are the people? What kinds of jobs do they have? At what wages? How about the children? Is there decent child care for the children? 
Generally speaking, the answer--and it will not just be what I am going to tell you on the basis of my own travel, but I also want to quote from some reports--is people do not know. People do not know. State by State they do not really know. There ought to be some way to assemble that data and at least get a report on what has happened. 
I can tell you, I talked a little bit about this on the floor of the Senate before. This is why I bring this amendment to the floor. It is why I am changing the conversation on the floor of the Senate at least at the beginning of this bill. It is why I think this is a matter of urgent importance. 
What I find is that I will go to a community, like in Delta, MS, or, for that matter--let us start with rural Aitkin County, MN, or, for that matter, maybe even more importantly, in Whitesburg, KY, and people will say in rural communities two things. No. 1--and in a lot of inner cities; I hope every colleague at some point in time can read William Julius Wilson's book, `The Disappearance of Work,' just an eminent sociologist, African American sociologist, who has done superb work; rave reviews for his very careful research. 
There are a lot of communities in our country where work still does not exist, even with a record low official unemployment rate. We have communities in our country where there are no jobs. 
So there are two issues here. If you are going to tell people they are going to be off assistance, we have to make sure the job opportunities are there. 
Now, a lot of people in rural America are saying, `Look, in our communities we don't have the jobs. And just as importantly, we don't have the transportation to be able to get to some of those jobs that are 50 or 60 miles away.' So I think we need to know what is happening. I mean, in Whitesburg, KY, in Letcher County, KY, boy, I will tell you what--I say this to the Senator from Kansas--you want to talk about a group of people that are independent, you want to talk about a group of people that are self-reliant and self-sufficient--I am a little biased. That is where my wife's family is from. This is the community. 
People say, `We want to be able to work. And if you give us the tools whereby we can have some access to capital, we can chart our own economic future.' And there are jobs for people. We are 
all for this. But right now, in a couple of years from now, everybody please remember in that bill that we passed, there is a drop dead date certain where, depending upon the State, 2 years from now or 4 years from now or a year and a half from now everybody is going to be off assistance. All these parents--women; almost all women--and children will be cut off all assistance. 
Before that finally happens, Mr. President, we need to know whether or not these families are now reaching economic self-sufficiency. We need to know what is going on. We cannot just cut all people off assistance without knowing whether or not there are jobs available, whether or not any will be available, or, worse--and I am visiting a lot of communities around the country, and I think Senators are probably hearing this now as we implement this legislation--they are telling me there are no jobs. 
Same thing in a lot of inner cities I visit where people tell me in Baltimore. And you know what? I am in complete agreement on this. I want my conservative colleagues to know that I am now changing my ideology. I am becoming a conservative Democrat. I cannot go quite as far as being a Republican. But I am in complete agreement with the proposition that you can have all of the social services imaginable, you can have the WIC program, and you can have the Head Start Program, and you can have outreach programs, but it does not work unless people have an employment opportunity. That is dignity for people. 
But you know, when I visit some just great people in Baltimore--they are doing great work--what they tell me is, `Look, all the social services in the world don't cut it unless there are job opportunities here. And the jobs are not available in our ghettos and boroughs. They are available in some of the suburbs, but people cannot get out to them. A lot of poor people do not own cars. And a lot of people rely on the public transportation.' 
So what I am saying, colleagues, is, let us find out--find out--whether or not people are moving to economic self-sufficiency. Let us find out what this reduction in caseload means. Because I think otherwise we could be doing something here in Washington, DC, that could be unbelievably harsh and unbelievably cruel and just really unconscionable, which is eventually supporting the idea that all families are cut off all assistance even when people have tried to find a job and have not been able to find a job, even when the child care isn't available. 
Now, as I travel the country--I wanted to also mention this to colleagues--I have met with entirely too many families who tell me that either their 3- or 4-year-olds, part of the time, are home alone because it is a single parent working because the child care isn't available, or their children, small children, age 2, age 3, one week are with a cousin, another week with another relative, another week with a friend somewhere, because there is no affordable child care. 
Or I talk to parents--and I would like for every Senator to put himself or herself in the place of some of these parents--who tell me that before this legislation passed, they would go to school, and they would pick up their first grader--this happened to me in East LA--and this mother, who was just weeping, she was saying, `I work.' She wanted me to know she was working. She wanted me to know that she wants to work. I was asking her, how was it going? And it was at that point that she broke down crying, when she said, `It's fine until about 3 o'clock every day,' because that is when she would pick up her first grader--now a second grader--at school, and walk her home, sometimes passing gangs in a pretty violent neighborhood. Too much violence still. And she would walk her child home, and then she would be with her child. Now she tells her second grader, `You know, when you get home at the housing project, you're to lock the door, and you're to take no phone calls.' 
Colleagues, I want you to know that even when there is good weather, there are too many children in America who are not outside playing because there is no supervision for them. Now, we ought to 
know what is happening around the country to these children. Just because these children are low-income children, just because their mothers are low-income mothers does not make them any less important than anybody else. They are all God's children. 
Mr. President, let me just read from a very important article that came out last week in the National Journal by Burt Solomon called `Monitoring Welfare Reform--Sort Of.' This is why I want to see us at least call on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to assemble some data, to provide us with reports as to what is going on. That is all. How many families are reaching economic self-sufficiency? Are people who are now off welfare, have they found jobs? At what wage level? Are the children OK? Is there decent child care? That is all that says. We all ought to want to know that. There should not be one vote against this. We should want to know. We should want to know. 
Now, to provide some evidence or marshal some evidence for this amendment, let me just read from this very fine piece by Burt Solomon. In quoting one Federal official:  
`I don't think we will be following enough people thoroughly enough'--or long enough--`to get a [strong] understanding of what's going on,' a federal official steeped in welfare policy said. Queried about whether there are plans to better organize monitoring, the official replied: `I think the answer is, not really.' 
Mr. President, I think that is sort of an apt summary. We just do not right now have any coordination. We do not have anybody who is responsible for collecting the data to be able to tell us what is happening to these families. 
Secretary Shalala gave a speech at the American Enterprise Institute on Friday, February 6. I will start out at the beginning of her speech. She said: 
But we also have a moral obligation to keep making improvements in welfare reform, and in our social policies. 
She is talking about how, now that we have had this law for a while, it is time to ask the questions and figure out where we need to go from here. 
`Today, fewer than 4 percent of Americans are on welfare. What we don't know is precisely what is happening to all of these former welfare recipients.' We know that some have married or moved in with family or friends. Others have left the rolls and are holding on to jobs that they were already going to--what is sometimes called the smoke out effect. But what's important is that many are looking for work--and finding it. 
Many are looking for work and finding it. But the real issue is that we still do not know what is happening to these 4 million people who are no longer on the rolls. 
I go on to quote from her speech: 
States are working hard to enforce the mandatory work requirements in TANF. Sanctions were actually rising even before TANF. Still, most of the 33 states that were authorized by waivers to impose full-family sanctions rarely did so. Now, when sanctions are imposed, it's usually because recipients fail to show up for their initial appointments--not because they refuse to comply with work requirements. 
Mr. President, I just want to make the point that one of the things that is happening--it is happening in my State of Minnesota--is a lot of people are basically getting cut off welfare because they are sanctioned. They do not show up for some of their initial appointments. But the question is whether they do not show up for their initial appointments because they do not want to work, or is it because they do not have transportation? Or is it because there is not adequate outreach? Or it is because we are imposing a kind of stability in the lives of people who sometimes have to deal with crisis after crisis? Or is it because, with a lack of child care arrangements, they cannot be there? 
I mean, we want to make sure that people are not just being eliminated from the rolls and then, not having any employment opportunities or having jobs that barely pay minimum wage, are 
worse off a year from now, and they no longer have any health care. I read from an editorial from the Minnesota Star Tribune entitled `Life After Welfare--States Must Ask the Right Questions.' I just quote one relevant section.  
The federal law requires states to submit lots of data on the number of clients who receive benefits and who find jobs, but it is almost silent on the issue of family well-being after clients leave welfare. As federal bureaucrats draft new reporting requirements, there's a danger that Washington and the governors will define `success' as merely cutting caseloads. 
And this is the conclusion of the editorial: 
It's worth remembering that Congress didn't tackle welfare reform because caseloads were rising--they were already falling by 1996. It wasn't because assistance costs were climbing--cash welfare to families has been stable at less than 2 percent of the federal budget since Richard Nixon was in office. It was because welfare was seen as a failed program that fostered other social pathologies: idleness, drug use, broken marriages and neglected children. Having blamed welfare for these problems, it seems only fair to find out whether welfare reform is solving them. 
Again, what I am saying to my colleagues is that I think it is terribly important that at least we understand--and to ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide some reporting of data as to--what is happening around the country so that we have some understanding how many of these families have found work, how many of these families are reaching self-sufficiency. Or are matters worse off? What has happened to those parents? And what is happening to these children? 
If it is, colleagues, the best-case scenario, I am all for it. If we pass this amendment and the Secretary provides us with some data, assuming she has the data--if she can't pull together data, then we have to figure out what we need to do in order to understand what is happening in the country--if she provides data that shows us that, as we look at this reduction of caseloads by 4 million, that many of these mothers and many of these children are better off, great. 
But if, in fact, we find that people have been cut off but haven't found a job, or they find a job that barely pays minimum wage and there is not adequate child care and some of their children are in harm's way as a result of this legislation, then we need to know that as well. Certainly we can't just follow through on eliminating all assistance for all families until we understand whether or not these families have reached economic self-sufficiency. 
Mr. President, I quote from an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer on a recent study by Tufts University: 
Despite numerous reports of welfare reform's early success, most states have enacted measures that hurt the families they're supposed to help, a national study at Tufts University pointed out that only 14 states have welfare policies that are likely to improve the economic conditions of poor families. 
Let me read a hard-hitting statement by J. Larry Brown, who is director of the poverty center at Tufts University, which I concede has been controversial because they have issued reports over the years. They have been at this for decades, and they focus a lot on malnutrition, hunger and poverty, especially among children in America. Sometimes we don't like what they say because it is just unpleasant news. But I think their research is terribly important, and I will read from J. Larry Brown: 
The evidence shows that as of now welfare reform is failing, and it is failing badly. The vast majority of states are not developing programs to improve the economic circumstances of the poor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me cite two other pieces of evidence to support this amendment and to explain to my colleagues why I have been out here from the word `go' trying to get us to go on record on this question. 
This is a piece from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The title is `Few Leave Welfare Earning Above Poverty Level.' This is about a study of welfare recipients in Wisconsin. 
Only about 1 in 6 families that left welfare in Milwaukee County in 1996 earned more than poverty-level wages. This is in Wisconsin, which has really put an all-out effort to invest in this reform. 
Let me read again: 
Only about 1 in 6 families that left welfare in Milwaukee County in 1996 earned more than poverty-level wages in a three-month period, according to the most conclusive examination yet of what is happening to local families under Wisconsin's sweeping welfare initiatives. 
It goes on to point out that `the turnover rate among those workers was extremely high--in part because the jobs were concentrated in industries that typically have plenty of part-time spots and a more transient work force.' 
By the first quarter of 1997, welfare recipients had left most of the jobs for which they were hired the previous year. 
So again, let's just understand that this is a study that comes out based on what is happening in Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, saying one out of six families that left welfare earned more than poverty level wages--only one out of six. Moreover, a lot of the jobs are part-time jobs, jobs that people can't count on, and a lot of people had to switch from one job to another. 
Finally, Mr. President, an article that appeared in the Star Tribune in my State, `Parents Face Cuts In Welfare Checks.' 
Hundreds of Minnesotan parents are in danger of having their welfare checks reduced starting March 1, the first wave of penalties meted out under the state's new welfare law. 
Interestingly, in Hennepin County about 50 percent of the parents converting to the new welfare system are showing up for orientation meetings at work; about 70 percent are showing up in Ramsey County. 
A lot of these families are in crisis. Some don't plan well--the bus can be late, they can't work out arrangements for kids. The question is going to be whether or not we are going to basically be sanctioning people and cutting people off, even people who want to work. 
Now, summarizing what this amendment says, we call on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to take a look at those families who have now been moved off welfare around the country and to provide us with some data as to what the current situation is. The whole goal of this bill was to move families from `welfare' to `workfare,' to move families to economic self-sufficiency. That is what we said it was about. 
I have said to colleagues today on the floor of the Senate that from articles that are now coming out, looking at what is happening around the country, we see some evidence that a lot of people who have been moved off welfare have not been able to obtain jobs that pay a decent wage, have not been able to obtain employment that gets a family anywhere close to 150 percent of poverty--out of poverty. I am saying to colleagues that Secretary Shalala, who has been very direct and honest herself, has said we need to know more about what is happening with these reform efforts. 
I'm saying to colleagues today that there have been some pretty hard-hitting studies that have come out, the Tufts University study being one, which have said that actually it is pretty harsh what is happening around the country. I'm saying that as I travel around the country I have tried to spend time in low-income communities. I have tried to be with people. I have tried to understand what is happening. I don't have all the 
empirical data, but I am just saying to colleagues what I have observed, and I think I have been honest in my observation. I have been in too many communities with long waiting lists for affordable child care for working poor, moderate income families, and now welfare. Therefore, a lot of these mothers go to work but there is not adequate child care for their children. 
I don't want to see, nor should any of my colleagues want to see, more children put in harm's way because of action that we have taken. I am saying to colleagues that in too many inner-city communities and too many rural areas, people have said to me that the jobs aren't there, nor is the transportation available to enable them to get to some of the jobs, that they would work, for themselves and their families. 
I am saying to colleagues that you cannot argue that because there has been a reduction of 4 million recipients, that that represents reform if it hasn't led to reduction in poverty. You can't say something is working well if what is happening is that many of these families are economically worse off and many of these children are not better by what we have done. 
I am saying to colleagues that I have heard enough speeches on the floor of the Senate about children. I have heard enough speeches about the very early years being very important for nurturing of a child, very important to fire up a child's imagination. I am saying to colleagues that in a whole lot of cases these single parents--almost all women, even with children younger than 1--are being told they have to leave the home and take a job. We don't know what is happening to those 1-year-olds, those 2-year-olds, the 3-year-olds and their 4-year-olds. It is our obligation to know what is happening to those children. 
I am making a plea to my colleagues. This is, I say to Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, a moderate Paul Wellstone amendment. This is a moderate version. All this does is say, please, let's ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pull together some data and make reports to us every half a year as to how many of these families are reaching economic self-sufficiency so we have some understanding of what is going on in the country. 
Before I yield the floor--and I am not prepared to yield the floor--might I ask the Senator from Missouri, because I don't want to keep him waiting long, but before yielding the floor, might I ask my colleague whether he is here to debate the amendment or intends to introduce another amendment.

If it will be accepted, then we can dispose of it and move on. 
If the Senator from Missouri means he has another point of view and wants to speak on this amendment, I am glad to yield the floor and then come back and respond to some of his arguments. I am not quite sure what he has in mind.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me also associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Missouri. I think all of us owe a debt of gratitude to our colleagues, Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus, for their determination and doggedness in getting this bill on the floor. This is a very important piece of legislation, I think, for all of our States. 
Mr. President, I think the Senator from Rhode Island, in a moment or two, has some questions he wants to put to me. While I am waiting for that, let me just, for my colleagues' information, give the official poverty level income for a family of one woman and two children. It is $12,516. And 150 percent is $18,774. 
This amendment, everybody should understand, doesn't dictate anything. It doesn't say that every family of three ought to be able to make that income of $18,000. It doesn't mandate anything; it doesn't dictate anything. It simply says--look, I think people trust me, and I have traveled the country, and I am telling you that some of what is going on--I am not pointing the finger at any particular point, although it is uneven. It is harsher in some States than in others, but we do need to understand exactly what is going on, whether or not these families are able to find jobs and whether or not these are jobs with decent wages, and what is going on with their children. We need for the Secretary to kind of bring together some data and present reports to us so we have knowledge about this. 
I see the majority leader on the floor. I would be happy to yield to the majority leader. Then if my colleague has questions he wants to put to me, I would be pleased to respond.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will add a half minute to what the majority leader said. I think one of the most important things that the Senator from Kansas does--and I mean this--is that, regardless of whether or not he is in agreement with you, he is looking at you. A lot of the times that doesn't happen. It means a lot when you have somebody presiding who has the graciousness to be looking at you with respect and to be listening to the debate. He always does that. I can never tell whether he is in agreement or disagreement. That means a lot to me. I suspect that he is usually in agreement with me, but I am not so sure.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is accurate. Since we are not in court, and the Senator from Rhode Island is always gracious, let me go beyond the `yes or no' answer. It is not at all clear that there will be necessarily a welfare bill from the Finance Committee or a bill that I can raise this question on. We now have a vehicle out here on the floor. My feeling was that, since this amendment calls for nothing more than just to ask the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide data and analysis to us, based upon what data she has as to what is going on with welfare reform, it doesn't seem to me that this really needs a hearing. It is pretty clear and straightforward and, I think, pretty noncontroversial.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Connie Mack from Florida, and I have submitted a resolution that deals with the upcoming U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in March and the position that our country needs to take in relation to human rights, or lack of human rights in China. This resolution, my understanding is, will be marked up tomorrow in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
Senator Mack and I submitted a resolution urging the Clinton administration to make every effort to pass a resolution on China at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights gathering which meets this month in Geneva. For the past 30 years, this Commission has monitored the compliance of different countries with human rights standards. It has investigated violations in countries in all parts of the world, rich and poor, weak and powerful alike. 
Almost 4 years ago, the Clinton administration announced its decision to renew most-favored-nation status for China and laid out a new human rights policy toward China. At the heart of this policy was the United States commitment, at least in words, to step up efforts to `insist that the U.N. Human Rights Commission pass a resolution dealing with serious human rights abuses in China.' Since that time, the Clinton administration has made it clear that only significant, concrete improvements in the human rights conditions would justify a reconsideration of that commitment. 
China has failed to improve their human rights record, and, in fact, as we turn a blind eye to abuses, the situation appears to be deteriorating. China continues to wage war against individual freedoms and human rights. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of dissidents and advocates of political reform were detained just this past year. They included human rights and prodemocracy activists and members of religious groups. Many have been sentenced to long prison terms where they have been beaten, tortured, and denied medical care. 
Harry Wu, a man of extraordinary courage and character, has documented China's extensive prison-enforced labor system. According to Amnesty International, throughout China, mass summary executions continue to be carried out. At least 6,000 death sentences and 3,500 executions were officially recorded in 1996 alone. The real figures, colleagues, are believed to be much higher. 
According to the New York Times last week, with the help of Harry Wu, the FBI conducted an uncover investigation, which confirmed claims that the Chinese are selling organs from executed prisoners for transplant. 
Furthermore, repression has increased steadily. Scores of Roman Catholics and Protestants were arrested. Crackdowns continue in Tibet. Authorities ordered the closure of monasteries in Tibet and banned the Dalai Lama's image, and arrests of political dissidents continue. China continues to violently threaten the unique culture, religious, and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. Taking a firm stand against human rights abuses in China, and around the world, is an expression of our solidarity with people who risk their personal safety to champion these principles. 
As an aside, in what travels I have been able to do around the world--and I wish I could do more of it, Mr. President--I do not think that I have ever been more moved in my life than by the courage of people who live in countries with repressive governments, whether they be left or right, and who have the courage to stand alone, and the courage to speak up, even when it could mean they could end up serving long prison sentences, or their loved ones, their wives, husbands, and children, can be rounded up, tortured, raped or murdered. These citizens throughout the world continue to have the courage to speak up for basic freedom. Our country ought to be there supporting these courageous individuals. 
One such person is Kalsang Lhamo, a Tibetan exile living in my home State of Minnesota. I recently met her. She told me how her parents were both detained and tortured by the Chinese PLA when she was a child. Their crime? What was the crime of her parents? As she was speaking to me, Mr. President, there were tears in her eyes. She was crying. The crime of her parents was the possession of photographs of their religious leader. The crime of her parents in Tibet was the possession of photographs of their religious leader. After watching her parents starve to death in detention and her neighbors executed, she, too, was beaten nearly to the point of death by Chinese soldiers during a demonstration. 
China's release of Wei Jingsheng and its invitations to the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights to visit are welcome steps. A Commission resolution can certainly acknowledge these developments. 
Mr. President, our Government can lead the way. The resolution that we must pass at this Commission meeting on human rights can acknowledge this. But they are not in themselves enough to bring about real changes in the lives of the people in China and Tibet, and the human rights situation their remains urgent. 
Also, while we are thankful that Wei Jingsheng is out of prison and safely in the United States, it would be a cruel irony if his release were used as a justification for giving up the fight for human rights in China and for our Government not taking a strong position at this U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva. First, of course, Mr. Wei's release does not represent systematic change. Second, he was not released unconditionally from his unlawful imprisonment, and he can be rearrested, if he ever returns to China. He can't go back to his country. 
Mr. President, as an aside, though I think it is relevant, my father fled persecution, was born in Odessa, Ukraine, but he grew up in Siberian Russia, and then he fled the country when he was 17 years old, in 1914. Then, after the revolution, he thought he would go back. Then his parents told him not to and the Bolsheviks took over, or the Communists took over, and he never saw his family again. 
My father and my mother both had advanced Parkinson's at the end of their lives, and so we used to spend a lot of time staying over at their apartment taking care of them. My father had lived in the United States, now, for 65 years. He had no accent at all. He spoke 10 languages fluently, as a matter of fact. He was an amazing man. And yet, when I would spend the night in his room with him, all of his dreaming was in Russian. Talk about the child being the father of the man or the child being the mother of the woman, all of his dreaming was in Russian. And the terrible thing was that it was shouting and it was screaming and it was anguish. I just had to believe that the reason for this, which many Americans can't experience, is how traumatic it must be when you can never go back to your homeland. How traumatic it must be when you can never go back to your country, never see your mother or father. 
My father, at 17, was separated from his family. I am absolutely convinced that his mother and father and sister were murdered by Stalin. All correspondence ended during the Stalin years. Wei Jingsheng has been released, but he can never go back to China. He would be immediately arrested and imprisoned. That hardly represents a standard of human rights. 
One of the reasons I speak on the floor of the Senate about human rights is to honor the memory of my father. He could never go back, never saw his family again. And at the end of his life, his dreams, I think, were full of anguish, all in Russian, because of that. 
Finally, Mr. Wei has told me personally that he believes in the critical importance of our effort to push for a resolution at the session of the Commission this month. Let me repeat that for colleagues. It's a sort of sleepy Monday afternoon on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We will mark this resolution up tomorrow in committee. One way or another, I certainly am going to bring this out as an amendment and we are going to pass it with an overwhelming vote, giving direction to the President and direction to the administration to, at this human rights Commission in Geneva, be sure to pass a resolution which will strongly pressure China on human rights. For God's sake, if Wei Jingsheng--who spent, I don't know, 16 or 17 years in prison because he had the courage to speak up--can put to us this small request that we speak about this on the floor of the Senate, that we try to pass some resolution supporting human rights in his country, we ought to be able to do that. That's the least we ought to be able to do. 
For years we have pressured the Chinese on human rights, though I don't think with nearly as much force and commitment as we should have. But to let up now, as the U.N. Commission meets, would be tantamount to defeat for the cause of human justice. Dissidents like Wei Jingsheng, who have been freed and have come to the United States, have thanked advocates for keeping them alive by keeping the pressure on and by focusing attention on their plight. As Senators and as Americans, it is our duty and in our interest to make the extra effort to promote democracy in China and, for that matter, in countries throughout the world, and to bring China in compliance with international standards of human rights. 
So, I just want to say today that I am proud to introduce this resolution with my colleague, Senator Connie Mack from Florida. This will be marked up tomorrow. One way or another, I will get this to the floor of the Senate as an amendment. I want us to vote as a Senate. I want us to give direction to the administration. I want our Government at this U.N. Commission on Human Rights to talk about human rights and to have a resolution which really puts the pressure on China for all of us. Whether we are Democrats or Republicans, we ought to at least, through resolutions and through amendments and through votes and through speaking--it is the very least we can do, to support these very courageous people. That is the purpose of this resolution. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors to the resolution that I have submitted with Senator Mack, Senator Helms, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Thomas, Senator Abraham, Senator Boxer and Senator Feingold.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it has been reported that a majority--majority; that is, Republican party--written portion of the Governmental Affairs Committee draft report reaches the following conclusion or contains the following statement: `In 1996, the federal campaign finance system collapsed.' I would like to associate myself with this observation by the majority members of the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
Mr. President, the system did collapse. Americans witnessed a corruption, a tarnishing of our political system. And I say to my colleague from Kentucky, the Supreme Court is very clear that that in fact is a justification for reform. People saw in a very systematic way special interest money dominate the discourse. And the American people stayed home in record numbers. 
It is not surprising that as this system becomes more and more dominated by big money, and regular people feel like they are locked out of involvement, and that this system dominated by money does not respond to the concerns and circumstances of their lives, they stay home. 
As a matter of fact, we did not even have 50 percent of the people voting in the last Presidential election. That was the third lowest turnout in the history of our country. Some people here on the floor of the U.S. Senate may be comfortable with that 
reality. I am not. It is the opposite of what I live and work for. And it is the opposite, I would say to my colleagues, of real representative democracy. 
Mr. President, a New York Times headline: `1996 Campaign Left Finance Laws in Shreds.' I agree with the judgment of this article, which I quote: 
Beneath the cloudy surface of the Senate hearings, one clear picture has emerged: The post-Watergate campaign finance laws that were passed to restrict the influence of special interests in politics have been shredded. 
Mr. President, Americans know this. Some of my colleagues may not want to face up to these truths, but Americans know it. They know that every Federal Government issue that affects their lives is damaged by the way big money, special interest money has taken over our politics. It is as if there has been a hostile takeover of elections in our country, a hostile takeover of Government, whether it is health care, insurance rates, taxes, telecommunications, banking, tobacco, environment, food and agriculture, trade, oil and pharmaceutical company subsidies. What is on the table and what is not on the table, what is considered reasonable and realistic, what is not considered reasonable and realistic, what is debated, what isn't, what is distorted, what issues are even dealt with in the first place--people in the country know that this is dominated by big money. The system has collapsed. The laws that are meant to regulate it have been shredded. 
What are we doing about it? We have a good bill, S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill. It is the pending amendment. It would, A, prohibit soft money to the parties. That is maybe the biggest abuse. This might be the most single important reform that we can undertake; and, B, it restricts--restricts; not prohibits--phony `issue' ads which are really election ads. 
My colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, read a piece yesterday on the floor of the Senate about $800,000 of so-called issue ads poured into one congressional race, one special election, by a party--$800,000 of so-called issue ads in a New York House district race last year to destroy a candidate there. 
The bill would also expand disclosure requirements. It would strengthen FEC enforcement, and it would discourage wealthy candidates from spending more than $50,000 of their own money on a race. 
It is a decent, worthy bill, Mr. President. I hope we can pass it. My two colleagues have worked extremely hard in order to assure that this vote could happen. And I think that the bill will receive a majority of the vote. But it is going to be filibustered. And I fear that most Members of the majority party do not want reform. They are not willing to allow an acceptable version of this bill to receive the 60 votes. Why is that? 
Mr. President, the public is fed up with the current system. Congressional Quarterly summarizes this aptly. `While polls show that the public is fed up with the current system, the public is cynical about politicians' ability to fix it.' 
Mr. President, my colleague keeps talking about the first amendment. Nobody is saying you cannot spend money. Nobody is saying you cannot speak out. But what we are talking about is that we now have auctions rather than elections. We are talking about the way in which money has subverted this system, systemic corruption, when too few people have too much wealth, power and say, and too many people are left out. 
Mr. President, we will also be discussing the Snowe-Jeffords proposal. I have said to my colleague from Wisconsin that I am a bit skeptical about it. I am a bit skeptical about it. I am not at all sure that I like the idea that this amendment only gets introduced if all 45 Democrats pledge allegiance to it, so that we can pick up two more Republican votes. But I know it certainly is a desirable alternative to the poison pill, the Paycheck Protection Act. 
But here is what I am worried about. Maybe for tactical reasons we do it, but maybe for substantive reasons we do not. I am a little worried that we now have the following argument before us: We are desperately afraid that we cannot enact real campaign finance reform this year because the public is not angry enough and because the public is not mobilized; therefore, we should weaken the reform bill in order to excite the public. I do not think that is really going to happen. And I think we need an aroused public behind this worthy effort. 
Again, I think it is desirable as a substitute for the poison pill Paycheck Protection Act, but it is also a retreat from the definitely superior express-advocacy and issue-ad provisions of the McCain-Feingold bill. Let me just remind my colleagues, that those of us who have been the reformers, we have compromised many times over already. 
As a matter of fact, the provisions of the McCain-Feingold bill that would affect us most are basically out right now. We are not even talking about a piece of legislation that really affects the way we ourselves raise and spend money in Congressional races. It is an important effort. I am for it. I want it to pass. But I want to be clear, we dropped the voluntary spending limits which would have done the most to assure a more level playing field between incumbents and challengers. 
In addition, we dropped the free and discounted television time. We also, as a concession, have inserted codification of the Beck language. 
We have gone a long ways toward trimming this down in order to try and get something passed that would at least be a positive step in the right direction, and the majority party is still stonewalling this. 
Now, Mr. President, let me be clear in dealing with the provision that Senator Jeffords and Senator Snowe have come up with. There is some merit to it tactically, without any doubt. I still worry that it represents a retreat. I'm not sure we can excite people by continuing to strip this bill down to the point where it doesn't have teeth, and it doesn't do the job.

Mr. WELLSTONE. He talks about turning nonprofits into powerful political tools. I'm worried about all of the ways, to quote Thomas Mann from the article, that this new practice has `become an utter corruption of the system.' I don't want to retreat from clear standards here. 
Mr. President, since I have less than 2 minutes, I hope the McCain-Feingold bill will pass intact. I hope we will vote for it today. I hope that colleagues will not be able to block it. I hope we will be wary of `deform' measures, not reform measures. We have to pass something real. We have to pass something significant. I hope we get a positive vote for this piece of legislation today, and I ask people in the country, please be vigilant, please hold all of us accountable. Don't let the majority party block a reform that would restore your voice and some real democracy in this country. Don't let the U.S. Senate pass a piece of legislation which would have that made-for-Congress look, a great acronym, but will not have the enforcement teeth and would not do the job and really wouldn't get some of the big money out of politics. 
The McCain-Feingold effort is not all I desire--I proposed the clean money, clean elections approach which has passed in Maine and that was also passed in Vermont--but it is a worthy piece of legislation and it ought to pass the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to talk about 2 issues, and I want to talk about them briefly. 
First of all, I would like to talk about this past weekend. 
I feel as if I speak on the floor of the Senate with a sense of history. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, said when he went to Iraq that he considered this to be a sacred mission. I think he was right. I think it was very important and is very important for our country and the international community to have resolve with Saddam Hussein and to make it clear that it is extremely important that there be unhindered inspection so that we, in fact, know what exactly is going on in Iraq and, for that matter, for other countries, I wish it would be the same in terms of development of weapons of mass destruction. 
Mr. President, I have to say this from the floor of the U.S. Senate. I believe as a Senator that war is always the last option. When you can talk instead of fight and when you can work out a peaceful solution and when diplomacy works and where there is a nonviolent resolution to a conflict, the world is better off for it. We should have no illusions, though sometimes people come to the floor of the Senate and people talk to each other and we get all pumped up and we talk about going to war and how awful Saddam Hussein is. I certainly agree he is a very cruel--very cruel--man. But, Mr. President, there is no question that if military action was to be necessary, a lot of innocent people would die. One child, one mother, one civilian in Iraq is one too many. One of our soldiers is one too many. 
I am prayerfully thankful that Saddam Hussein seems to have understood the importance of these demands and, most important of all, because of the strong position that our country has taken and also because of the very, very skillful diplomacy--very skillful diplomacy--of the Secretary General, I would like to thank the Secretary General for his effort. 
We haven't dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's, and we have not seen the specifics, but I believe as a United States Senator that his mission was a sacred mission. I am very hopeful that we will have a political settlement. I am very hopeful that diplomacy will have worked, and I think the world will be better for that. Whenever we can avoid loss of life, let's first do that. 
So we all wait to see. From what I have read, from what I have heard, and the Secretary General is a man who is very careful with his words, when he says he believes this will be acceptable to the United Nations, to the Security Council, I don't think he would have said that unless there is good cause for it. 
So I am very hopeful that this will be acceptable to the Security Council, and we will have a resolution to this conflict without having to go to war, without having to take military action.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me briefly talk about this campaign finance reform bill that is coming to the floor. By the way, this, I think, will be the business of the Senate this week. This is a core issue. This is the core problem, and this is going to be a real important debate for our country. I think it should be very clear to everybody in the country where all of us stand. 
I know we have differences. Probably the Chair and I have differences on this issue. But I can't help but believe that we can't get some good things done together, because I can't but believe that any of us who have been through these campaigns just hate this system. It is just crazy. 
I remember when I ran in 1990 in Minnesota the first time around. It was as if the only thing that mattered was how much money you had in terms of who gets to run, in terms of whether you have a viable campaign, in terms of who wins, in terms of what issues get discussed, in terms of who the people are who have access to the Congress all too often, as opposed to so many of the people who don't. 
This is a core issue, and if you believe that each person should count as one and no more than one in a representative democracy, all the ways in which big money have come to dominate politics severely undercut our democracy. As a matter of fact, I think it is part of what has led to this serious decline of participation of our citizens which really can only lead to decline of our democracy. 
So there are many concerns that people have, and they care about a lot of issues that are important to themselves and their families. But the problem is, they don't believe that their concerns are of much concern in the Halls of the Congress or, for that matter, the White House, because they believe that the political process in Washington, DC, has become so dominated by big money and special interests. 
How important it is that we at least take some steps toward eliminating some of this corrupting influence of this big money and try to begin to make these campaigns sane, try to begin to make these campaigns at least a little bit more of a level playing field. 
The Washington Post had an editorial today: 
McCain-Feingold is already a limited bill. 
I agree. I wish we had the clean money-clean election option passed by Maine and Vermont, but McCain-Feingold is a very important step forward. 
For lack of votes, the original proposals meant to clean out the stables of congressional campaign finance almost all have been dropped. Congress's indignation with regard to financing of presidential United States campaigns somehow does not extend to the financing of its own. 
Well, I would just ask people in Minnesota and people in the country: Please be vigilant. Please keep an eye out on our work. Do not let the U.S. Senate block reform. And do not let the U.S. Senate pass some piece of legislation that has that made-for-Congress look with a great acronym which pretends to do so much and ends up doing so little. 
That is the worst of all cases. I'd just as soon we not do anything as opposed to passing something which we claim will make an enormous difference but really does not and will just add to the disillusionment of people in our country. 
So I just say, this will be an important week. This is going to be an important debate. I hope we will get some things done. 
For my own part, if the majority leader will let us, I will have a set of amendments that will apply to the Congress. I will have a set of amendments that will apply to our campaigns which will be an effort to begin to go after some of the influence of big money in congressional campaigns along with some of the other things that we will be talking about, like soft money. 
If I cannot bring those amendments to the floor in this debate, I will bring these amendments to the floor in the next bill that comes up or the following bill that comes up, because I do not think there is any more important issue that is facing this country. 
So to Minnesotans and to people in the country: Please hold all of us accountable. Do not let people get away with blocking reform. Do not let any of us get away with passing some piece of legislation which has no teeth and makes really no difference at all. Make sure that we take some steps in this U.S. Senate that will at least get some of this big money out of politics and at least move us a little bit more toward elections as opposed to auctions going to the highest bidder. 
Mr. President, I think that I have about run out of my time. I yield the floor to my colleagues from Connecticut. 
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 
last October, Congressman Barney Frank broke new ground when he introduced HR2761, the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1997. I am here today to break ground in the Senate by introducing the Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligations Act of 1998. This bill does not introduce new benefits; it simply extends existing benefits to a previously uncovered group of employees for very little cost. 
Mr. President, let me take a moment to outline my bill. This bill provides benefits for same-sex domestic partners of civilian, federal employees. Partners must be living together, in a committed, intimate relationship, and responsible for each other's welfare and financial obligations. It provides access to five categories of benefits in the same way that married spouses have access: participation in retirement programs, life insurance, health insurance, compensation for work injuries, and upon the death of a government employee, the domestic partner would be deemed a spouse for the purpose of receiving benefits. 
This is a bill about justice, about fairness, about equity in the workplace. This bill is about saying to our gay and lesbian employees, `We value your contribution to the workplace, and to show you we value you, we're going to protect your families, like we protect the families of married employees, by providing them with benefits.' It is about providing the opportunity for same-sex domestic partners to provide their partners--who previously have been denied--access to such benefits as health insurance. 
For many people in this country, insurance benefits for their loved ones are automatic, they are expected, they are the norm. But benefits didn't start out that way. In fact, they are a relatively modern invention. Benefits in the form of compensation were created in the 1940's, essentially to increase compensation for some employees who were prohibited by law from getting pay increases. So instead of more pay, employers paid for certain products and services such as health insurance to take care of their employees and to make their businesses more attractive to potential employees. For gay men and lesbians, most of these benefits are completely inaccessible. 
But where is it written in stone that only married spouses and their children deserve benefits? Yes, many employers have chosen to limit benefits to married spouses and their children, but more and more, governments, universities, and private businesses have been making a different choice. Business and organizations like the San Francisco 49ers, Reader's Digest, Starbucks, Coors, Ben and Jerry's, Kodak, Disney, the Union Theological Seminary, the Episcopal Diocese of Newark, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers #18, Mattel, the Vermont Girl Scout Council, and more than 50 Fortune 500 companies have made the right choice to offer domestic partnership benefits. A more fair and equitable choice. A more humane choice. 
I am disappointed that domestic partnership benefits have already been offered in some cities and by some businesses since 1982 but here we are in 1998 and we're just now talking about them here in the Senate. Today there are at least 42 cities and municipalities, 12 counties, 1 state, and 342 private sector for-profit and not-for profit businesses and unions which offer domestic partner benefits. The good news, though, is that we have more than 15 years worth of employers' experiences with providing these benefits. 
By virtue of our vote on DOMA, we have said that same-sex couples cannot marry. But that doesn't mean that people in long-term, loving, and committed relationships don't deserve to have the opportunity to provide their loved ones with health insurance, survivor benefits, and other benefits. Domestic partnership legislation levels the playing field for same-sex partners who are not allowed to marry. This bill is aimed at correcting that inequity. Here is the story of how not having domestic partnership benefits effected one couple's lives: 
Anonymous: My partner and I have been together for almost six. About a year ago, he had to leave work due to a serious heart condition. Since my employer doesn't include domestic partnership benefits, we had to pay all of his expenses out of pocket. For quite some time I had to support him from my salary, or else he would have ended up on welfare. We are still scrimping and saving to try and pay off the health care expenses that should have been covered by my insurance (if we had dp benefits). Almost all of my heterosexual friends have been `married' less time than my partner and I and received benefits immediately after the marriage. Their relationships seem no more permanent than my own. When my partner and I have been together for fifty years, we will still not have insurance for him through my employer. 
Not only are domestic partnership benefits fair and just, they cost very little. Employers have found that upon implementing domestic partnership benefits, one percent of all employees--at most--actually sign up their same-sex partners for benefits. And 
more often, it is less than one percent. Even taking the most liberal figures, there is no legitimate reason to argue that more than 1% of our almost 300,000 federal civilian employees will enroll. And even though this is a relatively small number of employees--at most 30,000--let me tell you, these benefits are of critical importance to those who do. 
For example, Marieta Louise Luna is a graduate student studying in the Divinity School at Duke University. She says, 
I just returned home from the hospital on Thursday night from having a knee replacement made possible largely because of the fact that Kathryn is a Duke employee and I have domestic partner benefits. 
Guaranteed, I could not have had the surgery if I had not had domestic partner benefits. For me, it was the literal difference between walking and being handicapped for the next several years. 
And at a cost of less than 1% of the total benefits budget--or less--it is truly worth making this investment. 
Some might be afraid that domestic partnership policies could open the door to fraud with people signing up their friends in order to get health insurance. 
Most employers never ask for verification of a heterosexual marriage. I have never been asked to provide a marriage certificate to prove I'm married, and I doubt that many of you have either. 
But my bill has stringent requirements for qualifying as domestic partners. Among other requirements, partners must sign an affidavit certifying that they share responsibility for a significant measure of each other's common welfare and financial obligations. And they must show documentation to prove it--such as copies of a mortgage or lease with both names on it, copies of bank statements showing joint checking or savings accounts, copies of durable powers of attorney for property and health, or copies of wills specifying each other as the major recipients of each other's financial assets. 
In addition, my bill specifies serious consequences for fraud, including the possibility of disciplinary action, termination of employment, and repayment of any insurance benefits received. 
Finally, there are criminal statutes that provide that making false statements and defrauding the government are crimes which can result in a fine and/or imprisonment up to 5 years. 
The bottom line is that this bill creates serious consequences for fraud, establishes that every effort will be made to minimize fraud by those falsely claiming to be domestic and specifies that those caught will be seriously punished. 
Let me tell you one more story: 
Anonymous from Minnesota: I have had the same health care benefits package for nearly 16 years. I began family coverage when I married in 1978. Our two children were added when they were born. My ex-husband remained on my insurance policy after we divorced--at no additional cost--even though we were not legally married. 
I am now in a committed lesbian relationship. My partner had been teaching part-time in a private school for two years before she became eligible for health insurance through her employer. Two weeks before her insurance was to take effect she was stricken with severe abdominal pain. Though we considered `toughing it out' until her insurance kicked in, it became increasingly clear that she needed to be treated immediately. She had a large, twisted ovarian tumor removed. By the time of the surgery, her insurance was in place. We breathed a sigh of relief. 
Months later we learned that because her pain started (and was briefly treated) before her insurance began, the claim for coverage for the surgery and hospital stay were disallowed because there was a pre-existing condition exclusion in her insurance policy. We are now faced with over $5,500 (plus 12% interest per year) in medical bills. This may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but it certainly is to us. And it's money that wouldn't have had to be spent at all if she had been on my family coverage all along. 
So why is it that my ex-husband (no legal relation) was entitled to continue receiving benefits until he married, but my life partner has had to go without medical insurance? The answer is simple--discrimination. 
This is a bill about fairness. This is about equity in the workplace. This is about protecting employees' loved ones. It's the right thing to do.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams, to introduce legislation which would designate the U.S. Post Office Building in downtown St. Paul, MN, as the `Eugene J. McCarthy Post Office Building.' In doing so, we join the entire Minnesota delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives in honoring a man who is of great importance to our state and our nation. 
This building, which will bear the name of one of Minnesota's great statesmen, stands in Minnesota's capitol, a city represented by Senator McCarthy in the House and Senate for nearly a quarter of a century. When the 4th district, and later all of Minnesota, sent Senator McCarthy to Washington they sent a scholar as well as a legislator, and his service to our state and this nation has not been restricted to his tenure in Congress. He has touched lives as a teacher and author as well. 
Mr. President, I am proud to know Eugene McCarthy and to follow in his footsteps as a Senator from Minnesota, as a progressive, and as a great believer in grassroots democracy. He is a person who not only articulated, but exercised, a politics of inclusion and who knows that a candidate's success is best built upon a foundation of individuals. While America has had many important leaders, very few have fought the battles Senator McCarthy has fought, very few have shown the commitment he has shown to effecting positive change for ordinary people, and very few can match his record as a man of peace. 
Mr. President, it is an honor to extend my state's, and my country's, gratitude to Senator McCarthy with this designation.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, there were two articles today, one article in the New York Times, a front page story: `Pessimism Retains Grip on Region Shaped by War on Poverty,' Booneville, KY, eastern Kentucky, Appalachia. At the same time, there was also an editorial in the Minnesota Star Tribune. I ask unanimous consent that both the New York Times piece and this editorial be printed in the Record.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I just want to read one part of the editorial today in the Star Tribune: 
But since Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, better known as welfare reform, that self-regulated feature has vanished. States can kick families off assistance for many reasons--failing to find work, breaking administrative rules, or simply exhausting their benefits `clock,' a time as short as 18 months in some states. 
The context for this piece was that seven Midwestern welfare administrators have banded together, and they want us to ask questions about what is happening with the welfare bill in the country. 
I just want to say to colleagues that we would be making a mistake if we assumed that 2 million fewer families on welfare meant also that we had 2 million fewer families that were poor in America. What the New York Times front page article points to--and I had a chance to visit Letcher County, KY, this summer--what this editorial speaks to, I think, is a really important question. 
I am going to have an amendment that I am going to offer on the first bill that is appropriate which essentially says this: We cannot automatically equate reduction in caseload with reduction in poverty, and what we need to know as responsible policymakers is what is happening with these families. 
When I say `these families,' I am really talking about, in the main, women and children. I know that in my travels around the country--and I do no damage to the truth, I don't think I exaggerate at all--I met too many families where, as it turns out, 3- and 4-year-olds were home alone. The single parent is working now, but the child care has not been worked out. Or it is a very ad hoc child care arrangement, hardly what any of us would like for our own children, not really good developmental child care. 
In addition, too many first and second graders, I said before on the floor of the Senate, are now going home alone because their single parent, the mother, is working, but there is nobody there to take care of them when they are home. First and second graders are going home sometimes in some very dangerous neighborhoods. 
It is also true, Madam President, that wherever I travel, when I am told in any given State we have reduced the welfare rolls by X number of families, the question I have is, where are they? What kind of jobs do these mothers now have? Do they pay a living wage? Where are the children? Is it decent child care? And the interesting thing is that hardly anywhere in the country do we have the data. I can't get answers to those questions. 
So, the amendment that I am going to have on the floor of the Senate soon will essentially call on States to provide to Health and Human Services data, let's say, every 6 months as to how many families are actually reaching economic self-sufficiency. 
I am not trying to bias the conclusion one way or the other, but since, depending on the State 3 years from now or 2 years from now or a year and a half from now or 4 years from now, there is a drop-dead date certain where all these children--women and children--will be removed from any assistance, we ought to know what is happening. That is all I am saying to colleagues, let's have the data, let's make sure we know what is happening to those families. That will be an amendment I will bring to the floor soon. 
The second amendment I want to mention today is, I think, very much within the same context and, I think, important. Around the country, as I travel, I cannot believe how many women who are in a community college, who are on the path to economic self-sufficiency in school, are now being told that they have to go to work. It may be a $5.50-an-hour job, but they are essentially told they can no longer be in school. 
Madam President, I would argue that this is very shortsighted. This is very shortsighted. As a matter of fact, if these women can complete their 2 years in the community college or even get a 
4-year degree, they and their families will be much better off. 
So the second amendment I am going to offer will essentially call for a student exemption. It will say, let's let these welfare mothers pursue and complete their education. They and their families will be much better off. I hope that the community colleges and the universities will speak up for these families, because they know what is happening. This is, I think, a profound mistake.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I want to move on and talk about a related topic, in fact, very related, and this is a discussion that is urgent and long overdue. It has to do with the bill, S. 270, that would result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste in a small, poor, majority Latino community in rural west Texas. I want to stop that from happening, not only in Sierra Blanca, but in poor minority communities all over this country. 
The best way to get this conversation going, which is a conversation about environmental justice, is to make sure that the story of Sierra Blanca gets told, and it is an incredible story. 
Last week, several of the people who have been telling that story for several years were here in Washington. Father Ralph Solis, who is the parish priest for Sierra Blanca, led a delegation of Texans who told us of the anger and the anguish of the people of Sierra Blanca. It is not just the people of Sierra Blanca who are organizing. Citizens from all over Texas, from cities and towns through which radioactive waste will be passing on its way to Sierra Blanca, are all demanding that their voices be heard. The newspaper columnist Molly Ivins has written that, `This is community action and local organizing at its very best.' I couldn't agree more. 
Let me tell you something about Sierra Blanca. It is a small town in one of the poorest areas of Texas. The average income of the people who live there is less than $8,000 a year, and 39 percent of them live below the poverty line. Over 66 percent of the residents are Mexican American, and many speak only Spanish. It is a town that already has one of the largest sewage sludge projects in the world. Every week, 250 tons of partially treated sludge are brought to Sierra Blanca. 
So why has Sierra Blanca been targeted with both a sewage sludge project and a radioactive dump? I am firmly convinced the issue here is one of environmental justice. The tragedy of Sierra Blanca is part of the larger and very disturbing pattern across the country. In far too many instances, poor people of color simply don't have the political clout to keep the pollution out of their communities. Studies by the United Church of Christ's Commission for Racial Justice, for example, found that race was the single best predictor of the location of commercial hazardous waste facilities, and Texas was second only to California in the number of such facilities located in communities with above-average percentage of minorities. I don't think that is a coincidence. 
Let me be clear about one thing, Mr. President. Sierra Blanca is not being singled out because its residents are unusually fond of waste. In April 1992, the Texas Waste Authority commissioned a telephone poll of surrounding communities, areas where the poorest residents don't even have telephones, and they found that 64 percent of the people oppose the dump. 
But you don't need a poll to tell you that. Just show up at any town meeting or any licensing hearing. Local residents are often angry and emotional about their community being turned into a radioactive dump. And they have every right to be. 
Let us be clear about one other thing as well. Science does not explain the selection of Sierra Blanca, either. In the early 1980s, the Texas Waste Authority screened the entire State to find the most scientifically appropriate site. Their engineering consultants, Dames & Moore, concluded that the Sierra Blanca site was unsuitable for a nuclear dump because of its complex geology. But, lo and behold, that was the site that was chosen. 
You will hear again and again from colleagues on the other side that this siting decision is a purely local matter. It is not. The most obvious reason is that it is up to the Congress to ratify this Compact between Texas, Maine, and Vermont. Without the Compact, it is unlikely there will be a dump. Without the upfront payments from the other States, where is the construction money going to come from? And by the Texas Waste Authority's own projections, the dump will not be economically viable if Maine and Vermont do not sign up in advance. Texas does not generate enough waste. 
There are other reasons why this debate rises above the purely local level. If the Texas Compact passes the Senate, it is entirely possible that Sierra Blanca will become the low-level radioactive waste dump for the entire country. Backers of the Compact say that that is not their plan. They say no other States besides Maine and Vermont will ship waste to Texas. If that is the case, then I propose a solution. And I am hoping there will be support for this. 
Let the Senate agree to an amendment I want to offer, which is just like the Doggett amendment that passed the House, limiting the Compact to Maine and Vermont. Now, it seems to me, if the argument is being made that the only waste that is going to come to Texas is from Maine and Vermont, then let us just pass that amendment. And let us be clear about it. Then the debate is over. 
But we cannot shirk our responsibilities by pretending that this is nothing more than a State or local affair. The Sierra Blanca dump is unlikely to be built if the Senate rejects this Compact. But if the Senate approves this Compact, Sierra Blanca may become the Nation's premier dump site for low-level radioactive waste. It is that simple. 
The Senate vote will largely determine whether or not a grave injustice is inflicted on a community that deserves no such thing. It would be easy for all of us to turn our backs and just ignore this issue. But there is no way for the Senate to wash its hands of this business. For good or ill, we bear moral responsibility for what happens to the people of Sierra Blanca. This is a wrong that richly deserves to be righted. And we have the power to do just that. 
Mr. President, again, let me just make it clear that this is an issue of environmental justice. It is a David versus Goliath fight. There are lots of big guns in here that are pushing for this waste dump site. But we have one thing on our side. My colleagues have said, `Rest assured, this will only be waste from Maine and Vermont that will go to Texas.' I say, if that is the case, please support the Doggett amendment. It has already passed the House of Representatives. Then we can go forward. 
I will have one other amendment which just says that if we approve the Compact, but it turns out that it can be proven that this has a discriminatory effect on a community of color or low-income people, then they have the right to go to court. If those amendments pass, then this Compact will pass the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I do believe that the people of Sierra Blanca and hundreds of minority communities just like them from around the country have not been given their due. But we can make the system work. I am firmly convinced of that. Sometimes justice needs a 
second chance. Sometimes it needs a little push. And over the next few weeks, I think we are going to give justice a second chance on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I am hoping that these amendments will be accepted. I believe that would be the right thing to do. I think there should be strong bipartisan support for that. If that does not happen, then I am prepared to use all of the hours on the floor of the U.S. Senate that I have at my disposal as a Senator--and I will use those many hours--to talk about environmental justice in this country. 
Over and over and over again, we essentially take this waste and we dump it, right on the heads of low-income people. Over and over and over again, we look to the communities of color, we look to poor communities, we look to the communities that are not the heavy hitters, that are not well connected, and this is where we put it. 
This happens all across the country. I can bring to the floor of the Senate study after study after study that show that. I can marshal the evidence. I am hoping that we will agree that this Compact will be something we can pass, if we make it clear that the waste can only come from Maine and Vermont. If not, I think for the first time on the floor of the U.S. Senate we will have a really--maybe not the first time--but we will certainly have a very thorough and important debate, I think, about environmental justice.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Finally, Mr. President--I know other colleagues are on the floor. I just looked back and I saw Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, who I think has been the best labor Senator maybe in the history of the country. Maybe along with Senator Metzenbaum. 
It was Saturday night, and I promised myself I would do this. I want to make this a part of the official Record of the U.S. Senate. Saturday night, on the Iron Range in Eveleth, MN, there was at a gathering to honor a man named Frank Strukel who has been one great labor organizer. He is struggling with ALS, which is commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease. His friends from all over the State of Minnesota came to honor him. He should be honored. 
I see my colleagues--Senator Ashcroft, who happens to be a good friend, even though we do not always agree on issues. But one thing we do agree on is we respect people who work hard on things that they believe in. We respect people who live by the words they speak. Frank Strukel was that way. Frank Strukel is that way. 
I am hoping and praying he will somehow figure out a way to defeat this disease. He said that night he is going to be with us for a long time. I hope and pray that is the case. I promised him that I would say on the floor of the Senate that Frank Strukel has been one heck of a hell-raising labor organizer. And he has been just that. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. I say to Senators who are out here for the debate, I shall not take long. 
I rise to support the nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be the next Surgeon General of the United States and Assistant Secretary of Health. Dr. Satcher is a man above reproach, whose life path has brought him here today to serve as the 17th Surgeon General. We should not delay in confirming this nomination. 
What is it that makes Dr. Satcher such a wise appointment for Surgeon General of the United States? Look back over this man's life, for the fabric of a person is woven over the course of a lifetime. Dr. Satcher's fabric is tight knit, vibrant, trustworthy and strong. 
Where does he come from? Is it from his childhood, growing up in rural America in a poor family with poor access to medical care, nearly dying at the age of 2 from whooping cough? Is that what makes him such an outstanding spokesperson for childhood immunization, for childhood nutrition, for preventive health? Is that what makes him such a powerful role model for children to follow their dreams? 
Or is it from the tragic loss of his first wife, the mother of his children, at a very young age from cancer? This man knows the tragedy of disease, not just on an academic level, not just on a professional level, but also on a very personal level. 
Or is it from his professional, academic and public service careers that truly do make him very special? This is a man who has used his considerable skills to serve those people in our country who were quite often the poorest of poor and, in particular, I have in mind poor children all across our Nation. 
After graduating from Case Western Reserve Medical School, his life has been spent caring for patients, teaching students and promoting public health, and he has done it well. His most recent position has been as Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In his 4 years as Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Satcher had--a little bit of evidence--spearheaded initiatives that have increased childhood immunization rates from 55 percent in 1992 to 78 percent in 1996; improved the Nation's capability to respond to emerging infectious diseases; laid the groundwork for a new early warning system to detect and prevent foodborne infections; expanded the CDC's comprehensive breast and cervical cancer screening program from 18 States to all 50 States; and under Dr. Satcher's stewardship, the CDC has directed its attention to the causes and consequences and prevention of an epidemic which has long been a concern of my wife Sheila and of concern to me, and that is the epidemic of domestic violence against women in our country. 
Mr. President, I frequently come to the floor to talk about fairness, what is the right thing to do, what is the fair thing to do. And today I want to talk about fairness; yes, to Dr. Satcher, but even more so to fairness to the people in our country who are waiting for leadership from this Surgeon General; fairness to the families and children of inner cities I have visited all across America who are waiting for a spokesperson to tell them how to improve some of the unsafe conditions that they live under, how to improve their health care for themselves as parents and for their children; fairness to the residents of rural America who are medically underserved and are waiting for new ideas to make health care accessible; fairness to the youth of America who have been waiting for a clear and credible voice to lead them away from tobacco addiction before they light their first cigarette; and fairness to the victims of domestic violence and cancer and drug and alcohol abuse who are waiting for Dr. Satcher to speak from his bully pulpit about preventing these terrible tragedies. 
Mr. President, it is not fair for us to delay any longer Dr. David Satcher's nomination. We have the responsibility to vote. We have the wisdom, or should have the wisdom, to vote for this man who can do so much for our country. Elementary justice demands that the United States Senate vote for confirmation of Dr. David Satcher as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health. I yield the floor.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998. I am joined today by Senator Kennedy and Senator Harkin as original cosponsors of this measure. This legislation outlines a comprehensive strategy for providing critical assistance to refugees, asylees, and parolees who are torture survivors in the U.S. and abroad. It also protects asylum seekers from being involuntary returned to a country where they have reasonable grounds to fear subjection to torture. This legislation provides a focus and a framework for a newly re-energized debate about where torture survivors, and our response to the practice of torture by other countries, fit within our foreign policy priorities. 
Late in the 103rd Congress, I introduced with Senator Durenburger the Torture Victim's Relief Act, which laid down a bipartisan marker on the issue. I reintroduced it in the 104th, along with Republicans and Democrats alike, pressing forward on several fronts. 
I hope that enactment of this legislation will be a watershed in the movement to garner broader public and private support, both here and abroad, for much-needed torture rehabilitation programs. Specifically, the Torture Victims Relief Act would authorize funds for domestic refugee assistance centers as well as bilateral assistance to torture treatment centers worldwide. It would also change our immigration laws to give a priority to torture survivors and provide for specialized training for U.S. consular personnel who deal with torture survivors. 
Finally, the bill would allow an increase in the U.S. contribution to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Torture Victims, which funds and supports rehabilitation programs worldwide. In 1997 this fund contributed about $3.4 million to nearly 100 projects in more than 50 countries. I believe that continuing to expand the U.S. contribution to the fund is necessary as a show of genuine U.S. commitment to human rights, and I will continue to push until these programs receive the funding they need and deserve. 
Mr. President, the practice of torture is one of the most serious human rights issues of our time. Governmental torture, and torture being condoned by officials of governments, occurs in at least 70 countries today. We need look no farther than today's headlines about Algeria, Turkey, Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, China and Tibet to know that we will be dealing with the problems that torture victims face for many years. 
In many countries torture is routinely employed in police stations to coerce confessions or obtain information. Detainees are subjected to both physical and mental abuse. Methods include beatings with sticks and whips; kicking with boots; electric shocks; and suspension from one or both arms. Victims are also threatened, insulted and humiliated. In some cases, particular those involving women, victims are stripped, exposed to verbal and sexual abuse. Medical treatment is often withheld, sometimes resulting in death. 
In China, torture of detainees and prisoners is not uncommon, as exemplified by Chen Longde's case. In 1996, one month after his conviction without trial, Chen leapt from a two-story prison walkway in an attempt to avoid repeated beatings and electric shocks from a senior prison official as punishment for his refusal to write a statement of guilt and self-criticism. 
Richard Oketch was tortured by the Ugandan military. He was imprisoned for a total of a year in various military compounds near his home. His hands were shackled to his feet, he was denied food and sleep, and he was beaten regularly. Oketch managed to flee Uganda and eventually, with the help of the United Nations, he made it to the United States. However, the emotional scars of watching his family members and dozens of friends slaughtered left him for a time, unable to function in society. 
Today Oketch holds a master's degree and works as a program specialist 
for the St. Paul Public School. He credits his transformation to the treatment he received at the Minnesota Center for Victims of Torture. There Oketch received the services he needed to deal with his grief and become an active member of his community. Unfortunately, Oketch's story is the exception, not the rule. Most torture survivors, even those who are granted asylum in the United States, never receive the treatment they need. 
We can and must do more to stop horrific acts of torture, and to treat its victims. Treating torture victims must be a much more central focus of our efforts as we work to promote human rights worldwide. 
Providing treatment for torture survivors is one of the best ways we can show our concern for human rights around the world. The United States and the international community have been increasingly aware of the need to prevent human rights abuses and to punish the perpetrators when abuses take place. But too often we have failed to address the needs of the victims. We pay little if any attention to the treatment of victims after their rights have been violated. 
This commitment to protect human rights is one shared by many around the world. In 1984 the U.N. approved the United Nations' Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The U.S. Senate ratified it in April of 1994. Although Congress has taken some steps to implement parts of the Convention, we have not yet taken action to provide sufficient rehabilitation services in the spirit of the language of Article 14 of the Convention which provides that the victim of an act of torture has: `the means for as full a rehabilitation as possible.' 
We have also failed to adopt implementing legislation for Article 3 which states that `No State Party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.' Without legislation implementing this article, it is possible for the United States to return someone to a country even where there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be subjected to torture. This legislation would help ensure that the U.S. is fulfilling its obligation under the Convention Against Torture. 
There also exists a great need for the rehabilitation programs supported by this legislation. Without active programs of healing and recovery, torture survivors often suffer continued physical pain, depression and anxiety, intense and incessant nightmares, guilt and self-loathing. They often report an inability to concentrate or remember. The severity of the trauma makes it difficult to hold down a job, study for a new profession, or acquire other skills needed for successful adjustment into society. 
In Minnesota, we began to think about the problem of torture, and act on it, over ten years ago. The Center for Victims of Torture in Minneapolis is the only fully-staffed torture treatment facility in the country and one of just a few worldwide. The Center offers outpatient services which can include medical treatment, psychotherapy and help gaining economic and legal stability. Its advocacy work also helps to inform people about the problem of torture and the lingering effects it has on victims, and ways to combat torture worldwide. The Center has treated or provided services to hundreds of people since its founding in 1985. 
Some of the often shrill public rhetoric these days seems to argue that we as a nation can no longer afford to remain engaged with the world, or to assist the poor, the elderly, the feeble, refugees, those seeking asylum--those most in need of aid who are right here in our midst. The Center for Victims of Torture stands as a repudiation of that idea. Its mission is to rescue and rehabilitate people who have been crushed by torture, and it has been accomplishing that mission admirably over the last ten years. It is a light of hope in the lives of those who have for so long seen only darkness, a darkness brought on by the brutal hand of the torturer. 
I would like to thank the distinguished human rights leaders who helped craft this bill, including those at the Center for Victims of Torture in Minneapolis and others in the human rights community here in Washington and in Minnesota. Without their energy and skills as advocates for tough U.S. laws which promote respect for internationally-recognized human rights worldwide, the cause of human rights here in the U.S. would be seriously diminished. I salute them today. We must commit ourselves to aiding torture survivors and to building a world in which torture is relegated to the dark past. My hope is that we can help bring about a world in which the need for torture treatment programs becomes obsolete. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill, and I urge its timely passage.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I speak from the floor of the Senate as a Democrat but really to all of my colleagues, and to the President, as well. 
I think that President Clinton's State of the Union Address was, indeed, an important step forward for our country in some of the initiatives that he outlined. When the President talked about education and talked about child care and talked about health care, I think what he said resonated with people throughout the country. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that people are less interested in denunciation and more interested in enunciation. They really want to know what it is we stand for and whether or not we are thinking seriously, all of us, even if we have disagreement on some of these issues, about where our country needs to be. 
In that sense, what the President talked about was an important step forward. First, a response to what some of my colleagues had to say on the floor of the Senate, and then a response to some of the President's initiatives and to Democrats. On the Republican side, I think the argument that has been made, that I have heard colleagues make on the floor of Senate--and I summarize what any number of different Republican colleagues have said--in many ways amounts to the argument that when it comes to the most pressing issues of people's lives, there is nothing the Government really can or should do. This is not an appropriate role for the Government to play--to assure that there is affordable child care for working families, to assure that there is affordable health care, to invest in more teachers in our schools, reducing class size, and so forth. Quite frankly, that argument is a great argument for people who own their own large corporations or are wealthy, but it doesn't work for most of the people in the country. Most of the people in Minnesota and most of the people in the country are very focused, as I have said on the floor of Senate, as to how they can earn a decent living and how they can raise their children successfully. 
The President's proposals speak to that, at least part of the way. But what concerns me about what the President said, and I give credit where credit is due, what concerns me about the way in which Democrats are speaking about these proposals, is I think that we can do much better. This is our opportunity. The business cycle is up. We all talk about economic performance. This is the time where we can really make some of these critical investments. 
Mr. President, what I worry about is that we give the speeches, there is a lot of hype. We talk about the importance of early childhood development, we talk about the importance of education, we talk about health care, but we do not invest enough resources to put this on a scale where it is really going to make a significant difference. If we don't do that, if we have such a downsized politics and policy that we only reach a tiny fraction of those people that we are talking about, those children, those working families, then I think it invites mutiny because it becomes just symbolic politics. 
Let me give a few examples. Mr. President, as far as I can determine when we talk about child care, without going into all the statistics, and we think about families with incomes of $35,000 a year and under, we will probably reach, with the amount of resources the President has talked about investing in early childhood development, about 2 out of 10 children who could benefit--2 out of 10 children. If it is so compelling, and if the evidence is irreducible and irrefutable that we have to get it right for these children by age 3 otherwise many of them will never do well in school and will never be prepared for life, then why are we only investing in 2 out of 10 children? 
After-school program. Again, an important initiative, but as I look at the number of children who could benefit from this, and I think about my travel in some of our inner-city communities and rural communities, much less the suburbs, we will be reaching, with the President's proposal, about 1 out of 10 young people or children that are eligible. If it is important to have good positive things going on for young people in our communities after school, why is it only important to reach 1 out of 10 young people or children that would be eligible? 
Now I know what I am saying is counterintuitive because in a way I'm in the tiny minority on this, but I think we can do much better. I will introduce child care legislation and I will talk about 5 out of 10 children, that we can at least reach half the children that really deserve to have nurturing child care, that deserve to have the highest quality child care. Why are we only talking about affordable child care that is only affordable for about 20 percent of the families that need the assistance? Why are we not making sure that every child in the United States of America, when he or she goes to kindergarten, knows how to spell her name, knows the alphabet, knows colors, shapes and 
sizes? Why can't we make sure that we make the investment in the public sector, private sector and volunteers and communities, that every single child comes to kindergarten, ready to learn? The President's proposal is a step in the right direction but we can do much better. We can do much better. 
A second example, health care. Mr. President, I'm all for expanding Medicare, but the current proposal that the President has outlined makes it impossible for most citizens between the ages of 55 and 65 to be able to afford the premium. Most won't benefit. Second of all, I don't know why--I guess I speak more to Democrats, my party--why have we abandoned the idea of comprehensive health care reform, universal health care coverage? Why are we not talking about a strategy for our country whereby the next century, next millennium, each and every citizen will be able to benefit from dignified, humane, affordable health care? Why, Democrats, have we backed away from this? 
I'm going to introduce legislation that will have a national progressive framework, a defined package of benefits. Remember, colleagues, remember what we talked about a few short years ago, that every citizen should have health care at least as good as what Senators and Representatives get? I believe that. I think all of us should believe that. It will also make sure that States agree that it will be affordable and it will also have strong consumer protection, but then it leaves it up to States as to how to get there. There will be Federal grants for each and every State that agrees to reach, within the next 5 years, universal coverage. Different states can do it different ways. We can decentralize it. But we ought not to give up on the goal of humane, affordable, dignified health care for each and every citizen in our country. The American people believe in that. It might be that the insurance industry, which has so much clout here, doesn't believe in it, but the majority of people in our country do, and Democrats and Republicans, we ought to be on their side. We ought to be on their side. 
The third example, Mr. President, which is near and dear to my heart, call it counterintuitive politics because we don't talk about it very much but I think we should. I have traveled all across the country. I have had a chance to meet with a lot of people in poor communities. I want to raise the minimum wage. I think we should do that. It is a matter of elementary simple justice. I am proud to join Senator Kennedy in this fight. We will raise the minimum wage 50 cents a year for the next 3 years and then index it. If people work full time 52 weeks a year 40 hours a week they ought not to be poor in America. If you had health care and child care, you really would be making a difference in terms of family income. 
Mr. President, I also visited communities, be they rural or urban, where there are no jobs, even with the economy being where it is, even with official unemployment at record low levels. I go to inner-city Baltimore or inner-city Chicago or Minneapolis, I can go to Appalachia, rural Appalachia, I can go to rural Minnesota, and in all too many cases the jobs are not there, or the jobs at decent wages are not there. Why don't we make a commitment to making sure that people find employment? That is dignity. 
We have communities where there are compelling needs--there is elder care, there is child care, there is housing rehab, there is community crime prevention, there is teacher's assistance, there is environmental cleanup, all sorts of work to be done and people who can't find any jobs. I will introduce a bill that will provide people--we have now a 5 million job gap between people that want to work and jobs vacant--provide people with a transition whereby they have a job for a year at a decent wage with these benefits, and then can transition to private sector. We need to get more private capital in these communities. But when you have people in our rural areas, our ghettos and our barrios who have worked and worked on community-building jobs and have the dignity and build up some of the skills, then private sector gets more interested in these communities. But right now in a lot of communities in our country, people are crying out, where are the jobs? 
Mr. President, we can do much better. We have to make these investments. I am saying to my colleagues today on the floor of the Senate that as we go into the next century there are some contradictions we cannot live with. There are some contradictions in this city, Washington, DC, right here in this city, and all across the country. We have to make sure that we are investing in communities. We have to make sure we are investing in children. We have to make sure we are investing in education, and not just in education for some children, not just affordable child care for some children, not just health care for some citizens. If we are going to argue that these are priorities, then we have to back the rhetoric with the resources. We have to make the investment. 
Mr. President, I worry that at the very time where we have the best chance to make this investment--at a time of real optimism, at a time when I think people in the country feel good and know that we can do better, that justice, fairness, opportunity, building communities and building leadership are things that we can do--we are going to miss the opportunity by making speeches but not following up the speeches, by not really meaning what we say, and not really making the investment. 
President Clinton, thank you for pinpointing some of these initiatives. Republican colleagues, maybe in areas like child care we can come together. I hope we can. 
But for the President and all my colleagues, we can't outline problems and say we are committed to making a huge difference and then not make the investment that is anywhere near the scale of what needs to be done to make a difference. We can do much better than what the President outlined in his address for children, we can do much better for education, we can do much better for health care, and we can do much better when it comes to tackling problems with race, gender, poverty, and children in America. 
I appreciate what the President has outlined as a first step, but we ought to be doing much better here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. We ought to be doing much better. This is our chance to make an enormous difference. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I want to talk about the President's speech last night. Let me start out with where I disagree with some of what he had to say, and then let me talk about what I think were some of the sharp differences between Democrats and Republicans. That is not to say I am not interested in bipartisanship, but I think, frankly, if there are differences between the parties that make a difference, and people see a real debate and it is important to their lives, that will be all to the good. 
I think the President is dead wrong in what he had to say about welfare reform. I never called it reform because I think that takes for granted the very question in doubt, as to whether or not it is really reform. That there are a million or 2 million or 3 million fewer women and children--those are the welfare recipients on welfare today--than several years ago does not necessarily represent reform. A reduction of the caseload, reduction of people who are receiving assistance, has nothing to do with whether or not you have reduced poverty. It is reform when we have reduced poverty. 
I will just say for the record that, as I have had a chance to travel around the community, and a lot of poor communities in our country, there are several things which I found which are very troubling. I do not believe I do any damage to the truth when I say this, and think all Senators need to take note of it. First of all, it is simply true that there are 3- and 4-year-olds at home alone. It is simply true that there were long waiting lists for affordable child care, long before welfare reform, and many of these children are not receiving nurturing, important developmental care at the most critical years of their lives. 
This is wrong. 
It is also true, as I said the other day, that there are first and second and third graders who, when they go home, there is no parent there. I think it is poignant. I think it is wrong that there are fewer children playing outdoors now because when many of these kids go home they go into a housing project and they are told to go inside, not take any phone calls, not answer the door. That is happening in the United States of America. We need to take note of that. 
I think the President is also wrong because we don't know where these mothers are. We don't know what kind of jobs they have. And what is really astounding to me, Madam President, is at the State level we are not collecting the data. I think, as responsible policymakers, since 4 years, 3 years, 2 years from now, depending upon the State, all of these women and children are going to essentially be receiving no assistance, they are going to be cut off from all assistance, don't we need to know whether or not they have reached economic self-sufficiency? These parents, mainly women--do they have jobs that pay a decent wage? Do they have health care coverage? Can they afford child care? Where are their children? We need to know that. That is where I disagree with the President's analysis. And I will have some amendments almost on the first piece of legislation that comes to the floor of the Senate where I will try to get the Senate to address these problems. 
Second, I think we have to do much better in higher education. I was a college teacher for 20 years and I believe that we didn't expand assistance gaining the best bang for the buck. The way of targeting the assistance to those students in 
most need would have been to dramatically expand the Pell grant program. And if you are going to have tax credits, they have to be refundable. If you don't have tax credits that are refundable and you have a student from a family earning less than $27,000, $28,000 a year--which, by the way, is the income profile of many, many community college students--it doesn't do you any good. You have no tax liability. You can't cash flow paying your tuition because you get it too late to pay your tuition, and you are not eligible anyway. So if we are going to talk about making higher education more affordable let's, for gosh sakes, talk about these working families. 
That is disagree. 
Agreement: I think the President's focus on education, on early childhood development, affordable child care, on health care, was extremely important. Let me make but a couple of points for my Republican colleagues. As I listened to some of my Republican colleagues talk about the President's speech last night, I felt like what they were saying is: Oh, this is just Government all over again. Americans, when it comes to these pressing issues of your lives, there is nothing the Government can or should do. 
Madam President, if you own your own large corporation and you are wealthy, then that's fine. But for most of the working families in this country, affordable child care is a huge issue. For most of the working families in this country, making sure that your children get a good education and a commitment to public education and lowering class sizes and having more teachers and having more teaching assistance is hugely important to you. If you are from a working family in our country, you want to make sure, vis-a-vis an increasingly corporatized and bureaucratized health care system--listen, managed care can be good or bad. It depends upon who manages the managed care. But the fact of the matter is, the nine largest insurance companies own and control well over 60 percent of the managed care plans, and for them the bottom line has become the only line. 
So of course we want to make sure that people have access to the care they need. Of course we want to make sure that nurses and doctors can provide that care. Of course we want to make sure there are some independent appeals processes for ordinary people in our country. Of course we want to make sure that there are some basic consumer protections. And I think the President is right on the mark. What I am worried about, it is a challenge to colleagues on both sides of the aisle, is that the Congress will sure enough pass a bill. It will have a great acronym. It will sound great and it will have that made-for-Congress look, because there will not be any teeth in it, enforcement teeth. 
By the way, one way in which I would love to amend some of what the President was talking about last night, and I think we could get bipartisan support for this, is we ought to think about --Families USA has talked about ombudsmen, you know, through nongovernment organizations, through nonprofits, where people would have somewhere to go so they can have basic information about what their rights are as consumers. We absolutely ought to do that. We absolutely ought to do that. It's a simple proposition. Either we are here to represent big insurance companies or we are here to represent doctors, nurses, nurse's assistants, other caregivers, and consumers. 
The third point I want to make has to do with jobs. I said it the other day on the floor of the Senate. I will summarize. 
I will say it again. No matter where I go, whether it be low-income communities, poor communities, middle-income communities, it doesn't matter--and for that matter upper-income communities. People are focused on how to earn a decent living and how to give their children the care they know they need and deserve. I am going, for a moment, to talk about low-income, since we don't talk that much about low-income, poor people. I will tell you that there are two challenges here. One, the President talked about raising the minimum wage. Senator Kennedy and I have been out on the floor. We talked about the legislation we have introduced, 50 cents a year for 3 years and then indexing it. I will tell you that is extremely important. Because it is wrong when people work full-time, all year round, and they are still poor in America. That should not be the case. When people work, play by the rules of the game, they ought not to be poor. 
My second point, however, is different. It doesn't do any good to raise the minimum wage if people live in communities where there is no work at all. We have communities in our country, ghettos and barrios in rural areas, where there is no work. And we really do need to figure out ways of combining our initiatives while at the same time providing some job opportunities for people to build up some skills and then be able to transition to private sector employers. If we are going to rebuild crumbling schools--and we should, God knows, when students go into schools that are so uninviting, with ceilings falling in. Imagine, could we do our work if the heating didn't work? If the plumbing didn't work? If the air conditioning didn't work during the summer? If we didn't have access to Internet? If we didn't have access to the best books? Could we do our work? A lot of students are going to school in decrepit buildings, unsafe, that tell those students we don't value them. 
If we are going to rebuild crumbling schools, invest some money in that infrastructure, I think we ought to also make sure that a certain percentage of the jobs go to the adults, the fathers and mothers of those children who live in these communities. Because these are communities that are ravaged by high levels of unemployment. Let's combine rebuilding the schools with some job training and jobs for some of the parents in the community. 
If we are going to reduce class size we can talk about 100,000 more teachers, but there is also a role for teaching assistants that can help a teacher in a classroom. That could provide employment for people who live in these communities without any jobs at all. So I would like to see us have more of a focus in this area. To a certain extent I am talking about people who all too often are faceless and voiceless here, but I think it is extremely important, as a matter elementary justice, that we focus in this area. 
Finally, Madam President--I hope I have stayed within 10 minutes--an issue that you care a great deal about, an issue that I wish all of us would care a great deal about, even if we disagree on the specifics. I do not know what other people find, but I tell you I think an awful lot of people in our country, I am sorry, I think it is well over 50 percent, are just disillusioned and disaffected with politics. It is terrible. I think people think that both parties are owned and controlled by the same investors. 
I think that people think that when it comes to their concerns and their hopes about themselves, their families, their communities, their loved ones, these concerns are of little concern to those of us in the Congress. I hate that. 
I have two Republican colleagues on the floor with me from Wyoming and from Colorado, both of whom I respect. It does not matter if we disagree on issues, this is one thing we do not want to have happen. I mean, we do not want people to just kind of become so disillusioned that participation becomes less and less. We lose our democracy. 
So, Madam President, the final issue the President talked about--I hope we can move some campaign finance reform. We cannot get all the big money out of politics. I wish we could. But if we could at least pass some reforms that would give people some confidence we are serious about trying to get some of the money out of politics and make politics more responsive to the concerns and circumstances of their lives, we would be taking a big step forward. 
I look forward to the debate. I hope we have a lot of debate. I do not want it to be acrimonious. But I think differences between the political parties are healthy. I think if the differences make a difference to the people we represent, it is even better. The sooner we get substantive, the sooner we have bills out here on the floor, the sooner we have the debate, and the sooner we get on with the work of governance, the better I will like it as a Senator from Minnesota. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in this past Sunday's New York Times magazine, `When Naptime Is Over, The placid public mood is an illusion. Real Issues rumble beneath the calm and could soon send a wake-up call,' by Robert Reich, former Secretary of Labor, be printed in the Record.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to just speak briefly. I think we are all back. As the Senator from North Dakota said, I think most of us really are focused on the legislative work, Democrats and Republicans. I think that people want us to be focused on our work. But our work is connected to our conversations with people in our States, what people have said to us, and trying to connect what we do as legislators to the betterment of the lives of people that we serve. 
Mr. President, I was impressed with Secretary Reich's piece because I have found in my travels in Minnesota and around the country that while all of the macroeconomic statistics look good--for that I am grateful; the GDP and other indicators of economic performance, the official levels of unemployment, a record low, so on and so forth--that in many ways we have a paradox which is that we also, at least since we started collecting social science data, we have the most stratification in our society that we have ever had. 
We have the most glaring inequalities, and I think we have been moving to two Americas. It is not the other America that Michael wrote about in a very important book in 1963 about poverty, which I know the presiding officer has been concerned about, but it is two different Americas. 
You have one America with mounting access to all the things that I suppose you could say make life richer in possibilities, and you have another America struggling to make ends meet. 
You have one America that is barreling down the information superhighway, and you have another America without even the rudimentary skills to participate in our economy or to participate in our polity or to participate in our society. 
You have one America with the economic resources to purchase the security of gated communities, living in gated communities, and you have another America that is beset by the decay of some of our very important social institutions which we have to rebuild if we are to rebuild communities, libraries, hospitals, and schools. 
You have one America that is focused on a booming stock market, and you have another America that is faced with the insecurities of a job market still with all of the downsizing and the latest news about AT&T, I think, laying off 18,000 employees. 
You have one America that every summer sort of plans a trip to Asia or Europe, and you have another America where the discussion is, `How can we scrape up enough money to take the family to a ballgame?' 
Mr. President, I find that, in just touring the cafes in Minnesota--I want to draw from my data, which is now less social science data and just conversations with people. You know, most people in the country--poor people, middle-income people, professional people, it does not really matter--from really almost all walks of life, I think first and foremost, are very focused on how they can earn a decent living and how they can give their children the care they know their children need and deserve. 
To me, that translates into lots of specific conversations. I could talk a lot about health care. But there is one conversation I cannot forget. It was with a woman. I met her a year ago. It was very sad. Her husband is about 40 and found out he had cancer and was given a couple months to live. I met them about 2 months ago, and she reintroduced me to her husband, who is now in a wheelchair. 
She said, `You know, Senator, the doctors said that my husband had only 2 months to live, but he's a real fighter. And I want you to come on over and say hello.' You know how that happens when we are out and about. Of course, I did and was pleased to talk to him. Then she took me aside and said, `Every day it is just a nightmare. I'm constantly on the phone trying to find out what my insurance companies will cover, what they will not cover. It is a constant battle.' 
Mr. President, I think, therefore, health care is very much on the agenda. I do not have time to talk about all the specifics of policy, but I am very interested in making sure it is not just bottom-line medicine. I am very interested in all of us, Democrats and Republicans, making sure there is some consumer protection and also that the caregivers are able to give the kind of care they went to medical school or nursing school to be able to give. 
I am very interested in our really thinking about a strategy, going into the next century, about how do we obtain universal coverage, comprehensive care. And I think it can be a decentralist thrust with States figuring out ways to do it within a national framework, within a package of benefits, affordable, and with consumer protection. That is a bill I look forward to introduce. 
I think we can do better. I loved working with Senator Domenici on mental health. I tell you, there is an area I am really looking forward to do work on as a legislator and that Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell is going to be working with me on. That is 
in the whole area of the Substance Abuse Parity Act, trying to make sure that people--it is just wrong. People who are struggling with alcoholism, for example, where they get detox treatment once or twice, then there is no longer any coverage. 
We can do much better. There is a tremendous amount of discrimination here. We can do much better as a nation. I look forward to working on that legislation. 
Mr. President, above and beyond health care, I would like to talk just a little bit about jobs, and jobs with decent wages. I have had a chance to travel. It has been the best work I have done outside of Minnesota. 
I would love to travel with you, I say to the Presiding Officer, because I think as a Senator from Indiana you have focused a lot on these issues. We may have different approaches, but you have just a tremendous commitment to this. 
I have traveled in a lot of low-income communities from Letcher County, KY, where my wife's family is from, to Appalachia to Chicago to Baltimore to East L.A., to Watts to urban and rural Minnesota to the delta in Mississippi. 
There are two questions people ask in these communities. One of those questions is, `Where are the jobs that we can be trained for and that we can find to support our families on?' 
I think raising the minimum wage--I was speaking with Senator Kennedy about this--is absolutely on the mark. I think we must do it. I think it is a matter of economic justice. It is also true, however, as William Julius Wilson, in his fine book about a year and a half ago, makes the fine point that in some communities and ghettos there is the disappearance of work, there is no work. 
So the question is, how do we build the human capital and make sure there are jobs that are community-building jobs? And how do we link that with the private sector? How do we ultimately make sure people are able to get transitional jobs for a year to build those skills, to build community? And we can then at the same time have the job training and track the private-sector capital in those communities. 
I think it is a real priority, if we are concerned about these issues of race and gender and poverty and children. They are all far more correlated and interrelated than some of us want to admit. 
Another area I want to talk about is the President's initiative on child care. Two points I would like to make. 
Again, I do not do justice to the policy debate which we will have, but at least I want to just try to survey this. 
I think the President has really laid forth some good proposals. I think we can do more and should do more, and I want to talk about that. We have to make sure that the tax credits, if that is the way we go, are refundable so families with incomes under $28,000 who did not have a tax liability can benefit. 
I think the after-school care is extremely important. But you know what? I read in the paper--and maybe, Mr. President, you are a part of this that Senator Chafee and others were talking about--how it is we also can target resources to families where one parent stays at home. I think that is an excellent idea. 
I met with so many couples in Minnesota where one of them will say, `You know, Senator, one of us is not working. We understand why both parents work, but we made the decision not to. We forgo the income. We think one of us should be at home during these early years. And why not have some of the funding stream go toward providing us with some assistance?' 
I think that is an excellent idea. I hope we can really kind of combine efforts and do something about early childhood development. It is so important. 
The medical evidence--Mr. President, you have held some hearings--it is irrefutable and irreducible. We have to do well for these children. They are all God's children. And if we do not do well for these children--the private sector, public sector, community based--by age 3, many of them will never be ready for school. They will never be ready for life. And I cannot think of a more important investment. I want to talk some about that as well. 
Mr. President, I will finish up because I only reserved 10 minutes for myself. I just say to my colleagues, there is so much work to be done, so many problems. 
I was in East Grand Forks the other day. Last year we were on the floor talking about the floods. It was heartbreaking. James Lee Witt has just done a great job. I so appreciate what he has done for Minnesota. And FEMA came through. But you know what? We lost a third of our housing stock from the flood in East Grand Forks. There are seniors on fixed incomes, low-income people. They cannot find housing. We are going to have to build that housing. There is going to be State money. Maybe we can leverage Federal money. 
There are many real problems, many important issues that face families in Minnesota and all across the country. I have delineated some of them. 
I urge my colleagues, get out on the floor, do the work in committee, bring the bills and the amendments out here. Just do the work. 
I can't resist this, since the Chair happens to be one of my very good friends and is about to tell me I am out of time, I look forward to debating Senator Coats out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have a couple of questions that I may want to put to my colleague in just a moment. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts touched on two concerns that I want to speak about for a brief period of time. The Senator mentioned welfare. Earlier when I was speaking I didn't talk about the welfare bill. But I want the Senator to know that as we see the reports that this has been a huge success because there are 4 million fewer people receiving welfare assistance, I think there has been a lot of confusion. Welfare reform doesn't mean that there are fewer people on welfare. It doesn't mean you reduce the number of people receiving assistance. It means you reduce poverty. That is what it is about. It works if you are reducing the poverty for these families which are 90 percent women and children. 
When I have been traveling around the country it is heartbreaking. The Senator talks about after school. There are 3- and 4-year olds home alone right now. That should not be the case because mothers are told to work. There are also preschoolers who are in very ad hoc arrangements with a relative for this week or that week, then somebody else the next week. We don't have affordable child care. In East LA in Los Angeles there is a waiting list of 30,000 for affordable child care. The President will be speaking about that tonight. Mr. President, there are first- and second-graders. 
I met a woman in Los Angeles who broke down crying because she is so scared because her first-grader goes home alone--she is at work--to a very dangerous housing project, and is told to lock the door, and take no phone calls. There are children who don't play outside right now. 
So when the Senator from Massachusetts talked about child care, I just want to emphasize the fact that welfare reform only means reduction of poverty. It means that children are in safe places receiving good child care. That is not happening. 
Mr. President, I also want to point out that there are too many mothers who in our community colleges who are now told, `You cannot pursue your education. You have to work.' The job is $5.15, and if the minimum wage isn't higher one year later they will be worse off. 
I am going to have an amendment for student deferment for those mothers because that is toward economic self-sufficiency, and another amendment that is going to require States to provide to Health and Human Services the data in 6 months as to how many families are moving toward economic self-sufficiency because you just can't eliminate people from assistance and cut off assistance if people do not have the jobs and decent wages. 
Mr. President, I wanted to ask the Senator this question. The Senator from Massachusetts was speaking to an issue that I hear about everywhere I go, and it sounds like the President is going to be speaking to it, which is that I think people in our country believe that if you play by the rules of the game and you work 40 
hours a week or thereabouts 52 weeks a year you ought not to be poor in America. That is what this is about. The last time we had a debate on the minimum wage the Senator from Massachusetts just insisted that the Senate would address this issue. Does the Senator intend to make this such a precise priority for his work that one way or another all Senators are going to be voting on this? Are we going to have it on the floor of the Senate? Are we going to have the debate? Are we going to have a vote on it so all Senators can be held accountable to working families, or not?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor. I am pleased to hear that because that is part of what I am here for as a Senator. 
Let me ask the Senator from Massachusetts one final question. We don't just look at polls. But does the Senator have, in terms of what people in the country have been saying about raising the minimum wage 50 cents a year over the next 3 years--and we index it after that--is there broad public support that is a matter of simple elementary judgment?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator asked about Minnesota. Just two final points. 
One, I was speaking on the floor earlier and I said that I think most families are focused on how you earn a decent living and how you give your children the care you know they need and deserve. I think the minimum wage bill is an important step in that direction along with whatever we can do on affordable child care and health care. That is the key to family income in this country. 
I spoke earlier about the record of inequality. Secretary Reich had a very important piece in the New York Times about it. But now we see, Mr. President, a merger with education because, as a matter of fact, I say to my colleagues and my friend from Massachusetts what I find when I travel around Minnesota--and I was a college teacher for 20 years--is that many students are taking 6 years to graduate and not 4 years because now students are working on the average of 25 or 30 hours a week at two minimum-wage jobs. 
So we now are talking about a piece of legislation that speaks to the issue of how families can have more income and also how students can afford their higher education. Many of these students are 18 and 19. But let's not trivialize the teen part. They are young women and young men who are working hard to be able to go to school. You had better believe that this minimum wage bill is really of critical importance to these young people as to whether or not they are going to be able to complete their education and do well financially. 
So the Senator is absolutely correct. There is the strongest correlation to education and affordable education which I think all of us agree is an absolutely crucial issue. 
Mr. President, today I am co-sponsoring a bill introduced by my colleague and friend Senator Ted Kennedy, cosponsored by a number of others, a measure which I consider to be one of the most important items we can pass and enact this year--the `American Family Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998.' Our bill would increase the minimum wage by 50 cents a year during each of the next three years. After that, it would index further increases in the minimum wage to increases in the cost of living. 
This 3-year increase of $1.50--raising the federal minimum wage to $6.65/hour by September 1 of the year 2000, and pegging it to inflation in succeeding years--is the most immediate and practical step we can take to deliver to American working families a message of economic justice and principle. The message is this: if you work hard and play by the rules in America, you should not live in poverty. Unfortunately, that is not necessarily the case today for many working Americans with families. We need to address that problem. 
Full time work at minimum wage generates an income of approximately $10,700 a year. That's $2,600 below the poverty line for a family of three in this country. Minimum wage is not a living wage in America today. Even after the most recent increase, the federal minimum wage is worth far less in real dollars than it was in the 1960s and 1970s. 
Remember, the minimum wage disproportionately affects women. Sixty percent of those earning the minimum wage are women. Teachers' aides, child care providers, service-sector employees--some of the hardest working people in America, performing crucial tasks. Many of these women are single heads of households with child. One of the quickest ways we as a Congress could take a step toward real gender equity with regard to pay would be to pass an increase in the minimum wage and send it to the President. I am sure he will sign it. That would immediately improve the economic situation of millions of working women, many with families. 
Increasing the minimum wage will benefit those who need it most in America--adults, women, working families. Seventy-five percent of those currently receiving minimum wage workers are adults; 60 percent are women; 50 percent work more than 35 hours a week; 82 percent work at least 20 hours a week. 
Look at a few numbers which tell a story. 
The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities recently released a report showing that income inequality grew in 48 of 50 states since the late 1970s. The decline in real incomes of the poorest one-fifth of families with children in America averaged 21 percent, or $2,500. 
Since 1968, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, grew by 115 percent while the purchasing power of the minimum wage declined by 30 percent. 
To reflect the purchasing power it maintained in 1968, today's minimum wage would have to be at $7.33/hour, not $5.15. So even a carefully charted increase to $6.65/hour will not make up the entire difference, but it will put us back on a road to responsibly representing our constituents. 
For nearly the last two decades, the bottom 20 percent of income earners in this country haven't experienced growth like most Americans. Instead, they have lost 9 percent in real family income growth, while the top 20 percent have gained more than 26 percent. 
Our bill is about justice. In recent weeks and months, I have traveled around this country: East and South Central Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago, the Mississippi Delta, Appalachia, as well as in my home state of Minnesota. I have repeatedly seen the struggles of hard working, dedicated people who want to improve their lives, but they can't find jobs that will pay them a livable wage. 
Now increasing the minimum wage will not compromise the economy and it will not harm the falling unemployment rate. Consider that in September 1996, just one month prior to the minimum wage increase from $4.25 to $4.75, the national unemployment rate was at 5.2 percent. By December 1997, two months after the second annual increase to $5.15, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent. And retail trade jobs, where a disproportionate amount of low wage workers are employed, increased slightly. Job opportunities in this country are not compromised by this legislation. In fact, the very importance and value of job opportunities to all Americans is exactly what is enforced by this legislation. 
Today's economy continues to perform well. Yet the minimum wage--part of that same economy--has progressively fallen back. In 1996, we started to pave the right path to justice by increasing the minimum wage, but more must be done. 
So I stand in support as the first co-sponsor of this bill and urge Democrats and Republicans alike to support Senator Kennedy's initiative and to support the American workforce by passing the Family Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to take this time Sunday afternoon as we approach the end of this session to talk about some unfinished business for the Congress and I think for the Nation. I really was moved, and I do not usually use that word, by the eloquence of my colleague, Senator Durbin, from Illinois. As I came in, I heard Senator Durbin talk about children and talk about early years and talk about early childhood development and talk about whether or not we as a nation are going to make a commitment to affordable child care. 
I want to talk about a really difficult issue for the Senate, for the Congress, and I think for the White House, and when we come back for me this will be one of the first items of business. I want us to have discussion and I would like to see whether or not we would be willing to perhaps take some important action. 
I am talking about the bill that was passed which was called welfare reform. Mr. President, some of what was in that bill represented over $50 billion of cuts in the name of deficit reduction in the major food nutrition program in the country, food stamps--20 percent cut for families, most of them working families, most of the recipients children. And the other part was the cuts in benefits to legal immigrants, some of which has been corrected, some of which has not. 
What worries me--and I have traveled the country and spent quite a bit of time in low-income communities. I haven't just focused on welfare, but I have been to the delta in Mississippi with Congressman Bennie Thompson; I have been to eastern Kentucky, to Letcher County, Whitesburg, KY; I have been to Chicago in housing projects, and, of course, I have been in Minnesota, both urban and rural, and I have been to L.A., East L.A., and Watts. One of the things that worries me is that I see in many articles and too much of the media coverage and certainly too much of what I hear from both Democrats and Republicans in Washington that welfare reform has been a success as defined by reduction of caseload. Any Democrat, any Republican, or any fool can knock people off the welfare rolls. That has nothing to do with reform. The only way reform can be defined is not by reduction of caseload but by reduction of poverty. Are these families, in the main headed by women and children, better off? 
I heard my colleague from Illinois talk about child care, and if my colleague was here I would tell him about some just very emotional experiences that I have had, meeting with some of the women who have now been told they are to work, and they work. 
But their concern is about what happens to their children. You know, just because they are poor, just because they are welfare mothers, doesn't make them, or doesn't make their children, any less worthy, any less important. 
In Los Angeles, for example, in L.A., one city, they have a waiting list of 30,000 families for affordable child care. That is before the welfare bill. The question I ask colleagues is, where are these children? Fine, the mothers are now working. Do we know where the children are? Where are they? Who is taking care of them? Is it developmental child care? Is it just custodial? Or are they even in harm's way? We don't know. But we should know. We passed the legislation. 
I met a woman, and this story of this one mother unfortunately is the story of other mothers. She said to me, `I want to work.' By the way, almost all the people I meet want to work. That's a big thing to people in our country, to be able to work and make a decent wage and support your family. And also to be able to give your children the care you know they need and deserve. But I am meeting some of these mothers. We told them we would sort of delegate this to the States and they would work. 
Here is what they say to me, what this one mother in L.A. said. I then visited actually where she lived, public housing in east L.A. She said to me: `I want to work but I am so frightened because my first grader goes home alone every day. I worry about what happens to her from the time she leaves school to when she gets back to the apartment'--public housing. `There are gangs, there is violence. I tell her to go into the apartment, lock the door, and don't take any phone calls.' 
I would like to ask Senators, how many of you would like for your first graders, whether they are your children or your grandchildren, to go home alone? Actually, to go home to wherever you live, much less in the neighborhoods and communities that are so dangerous. In the debate that we had on welfare reform, did anybody ever talk about these children? I never heard a word. 
We talk a lot about early childhood development, which is very important. We talk a lot about after-school programs for teenagers, which is critically important. But what about these first and second graders? I think there are too many children in our country right now, because of what is happening around the country, who are in danger. And I think it is our responsibility to know what is going on. Speeches do not suffice. 
When I was in Letcher County, KY, I spent quite a bit of time with Carroll Smith, who is the county executive, Republican--county Judge, which is like the county executive; just a great, great guy. It was interesting, though. He and others were saying to me, did anyone ever mention the word `rural' when you all passed that bill? Because in the absence of access to capital and our seeing economic development in our community, we don't know where the jobs are going to be. 
The Wall Street Journal had--I haven't even had a chance to read the article from cover to cover--a very long, extensive piece about Delta, MS, where lots of people can't find jobs, or have to drive 60, 70 miles. Again, you have two things going on here. No. 1, there are not the jobs where people live in rural America. No. 2, the jobs that quite often these women are getting maybe pay $6 an hour. They are going to be worse off than they were before, because there will not be health care after a while, and they don't know what to do by way of child care. 
It seems to me that one of the things that we need to do is at least call on the States to provide us with an evaluation, maybe every 6 months or every year, on how families are doing toward attaining the goal of economic self-sufficiency. Because if we don't do that, 4 years from now all these families are off all assistance. Don't you think, before we have some tragedy, we ought to at least know what is going on? I am going to have an amendment, a piece of legislation which I will bring to the floor of the Senate and we will have that vote. 
Mr. President, I go to the communities. It has been very moving. I hope to get a chance to write a long piece about what I have learned from people. But I don't find that the issues that people in low-income communities are talking about are really different than issues that other working families are talking about. The first question is: Where are the jobs that pay a decent wage? This is still one of the most important challenges for most families in our country. It is an important challenge in poor communities: Where are the jobs? And we are going to have to have an urban jobs program if we are serious about reducing poverty and making sure that families have a chance. Also, we are going to have to do a lot better by way of making sure that, if people work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they are not poor. If people play by the rules of the game and they work hard, they ought not to be poor. That is where child care fits in. That is where health care fits in. And not just for low-income families, but for the vast majority of families in our country. 
I heard my colleague from Illinois speak. I was so pleased 
to hear what he said. But I would like to challenge both Republicans and Democrats, because I think that what is going on here is we have a debate that, in a way, may take us nowhere, or at least certainly not connect very well with a lot of people in our country. 
On the one hand my friend Jeff Faux has written a very interesting piece where he argues this. I will take a piece of what Jeff says. On the one hand, for example, we have the majority party, the Republican Party, which argues--at the risk of getting the Chair angry at me--which argues, when it comes to some of these most pressing issues, for example affordable child care, there is nothing the Government can or should do. My argument is that is a great philosophy if you own your own large corporation and you are wealthy, but it doesn't work for most of the people in the country. On the other hand, you have the Democratic Party that says we are all for the children, we are all for education, we are all for job training. But, do you know what? Politically there is not anything we can do either. We just have to cut taxes because politically that is the only way we can make it. In which case neither party has a whole lot to say to the very families we are talking about, at least if you get beyond speeches and conferences. 
We have had enough speeches. We have had enough conferences. The question is whether or not we are going to go beyond the speeches and the conferences and dig into our pockets and make the kind of investment that we need to make as a nation. I think the question for all of us is how can we renew our national vow of equal opportunity for every child in America? That is the goodness of our country. That ought to be the central goal of public policy here in the Congress. I make a commitment, as a Senator from Minnesota, to bring that kind of legislation out on the floor, working with others, with the financing, with the investment, so this isn't empty rhetoric. We ought not to separate the budgets we introduce from the words that we speak. 
Finally, let me make one other point. My training is as a political scientist--I was a college teacher before I became a U.S. Senator--not as a political economist, although I am interested in political economy. There is something very interesting and very important going on in our country, which is now we have reports about record low levels of unemployment. The GDP looking great. Productivity is up. But real wages of most families are down. The economy of American families is not measured by GDP, it is not measured by all these official statistics. It is measured by real family income. It is measured by whether or not people can purchase the things that make life richer in possibilities. It is measured by opportunities. It is measured by security or insecurity. And it is measured by our expectations for our children and our grandchildren. And by that criterion, a whole lot of families could be doing better and we could be doing better as a nation. 
One of the issues that I think is a living-room issue in America, a kitchen-table issue, that we are going to have to have the courage to take on, is health care. We can have patient protection--I am all for that. We can have provider protection--I am all for that. We can try to control some of these large insurance companies that own and control most of the managed care plans--I am all for that. But the fact of the matter is, we have now moved from 40 to 44 million people or thereabouts without any health insurance since we first started talking about this 3 years ago; more than twice that number of underinsured, and the vast majority of people in the country, not just low-income--either people are not old enough for Medicare, and Medicare doesn't cover prescription drug costs, it doesn't cover catastrophic expenses, or people aren't poor enough for medical assistance and they are not lucky enough to be able to work for an employer who provides them with good health care coverage. 
We ought to have humane, dignified, affordable health care for every man, woman, and child in our Nation. For me, next session, that will be my priority--with the financing, clear with people in the country how you pay for it. But I am telling you, large insurance companies don't like it. And there are a whole bunch of other powerful interests that don't like it. But the majority of people in this country know that this system is in big-time crisis. It is time we get back to this issue as a Congress. 
I really do think that, as we think about what we have done and what we have not done--I will just talk a little bit about what we haven't done in the few minutes I have left. I think these standard of living issues are the critical issues. I think, unfortunately, Jeff Faux is right, neither party is telling the story that gives people any confidence that much is going to happen that is good for them. And I think we could do better, all of us. 
And in addition, the one other issue that we did not get the job done on, and it is critically important, is campaign finance reform. When I go into cafes in Minnesota, this is one thing I don't gloat about. I am not even pleased to say it, but it is true. Because it is aimed at me. It is aimed at all of us. The vast 
majority of people I talk to in cafes believe both parties now--they just sort of view the Government as being controlled by wealthy financial interests. They just feel locked out. They feel like it is for big players and heavy hitters. And, you know what, all of us have to raise money. That's what we have to do. That's not the point. I did. We all do. That's the system right now. 
We should change this. We didn't, not this time. We come back to it next year. But this is a real important issue and it is not that people don't care about it. They care about it deeply and desperately. And I think they want to believe in the political process. They want to believe in Government. But we are going to continue to see a tremendous amount of cynicism and apathy and disengagement and disillusionment unless we get as much of this money out of politics as possible. We know what the criterion is. We have talked about it enough. It is time to really move forward. It can't just be like a piece of legislation where we maybe do one thing but then all the money shifts somewhere else. Then people will just be even more disillusioned. I think this is a core issue. 
There are a lot of good things all of us could do here. A lot of good things get trumped by big money in politics. 
Mr. President, I will conclude--how much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just conclude by thanking all the conferees on the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill, especially for all the women and men in the Parkinson's community who worked so hard to make sure that we have some clear directive to NIH about making sure that there will now be some real investment of resources in research to find the cure to Parkinson's disease. It has been one of the greatest lobbying efforts I have ever seen here. It was citizen lobbyists, people who struggle with this disease, who once upon a time were kind of embarrassed to be public and be out and about. People have been there. 
All of you in the Parkinson's community, you have set a really good model for the Nation. Because if we had more people like you coming to Washington, DC, it would be a better Congress. 
We need to get a lot more ordinary citizens coming to Washington or meeting with us back in our States. I just hope more and more people will be like that. It was a really fine victory. 
Mr. President, I presume then there will not be an opportunity--my colleagues are on the floor as well--we are not going back to fast track, is that correct?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Voting Rights of Homeless Citizens Act of 1997. I am proud to stand alongside the distinguished House sponsor of this bill, Representative John Lewis. 
Mr. President, over the course of the last century, Congress has systematically removed the major obstacles that once prevented many of our citizens from voting. Not too long ago, only land-owning white men had the privilege of participating in our democracy. Women and minorities were prohibited from casting the ballot. More recently, people had to pay a poll tax or take a test in order to qualify to vote. 
Before the civil rights movement, there were areas in the southern part of this country where the vast majority of the population was black, but there wasn't a single registered black voter. In 1964, three young men gave their lives while working to register people to vote in rural Mississippi. Many people over the course of our history have sacrificed their lives in order to expand voting rights for all Americans. 
In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson proposed that we `eliminate every remaining obstacle to the right and opportunity to vote.' Eight months later, this Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, making it possible for millions of Americans to participate in the political process for the first time. 
Our Nation has made even more progress since then. The motor voter law made voter registration more accessible to working people. But our historic strides have not taken us far enough. The time is long overdue to ensure that every American has the opportunity to exercise this fundamental right. It is reprehensible that there are still American adults who are unable to partake of the most important right of citizenry. 
The purpose of this legislation is to give the power to vote to homeless citizens of this country. The bill would remove the legal and administrative barriers that inhibit them from exercising this right. No one should be excluded from registering to vote simply because they do not have an address. But in many States, the homeless are left out and left behind. This is wrong. This is against the grain of this great nation. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in opening the political process to every American--even those without a home. I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring and supporting passage of the Voting Rights of Homeless Citizens Act of 1997.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill that will help atomic veterans--veterans who were exposed to ionizing radiation while serving on active duty. Atomic veterans are not only America's most neglected veterans, but they have been deceived and treated shabbily for more than 50 years by the Government they served so selflessly and unquestioningly. 
Mr. President, it is hardly accidental that I chose to entitle this bill the `Justice for Atomic Veterans Act of 1997.' Atomic veterans have been seeking justice almost since the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The U.S. Government has a long overdue debt to them and I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring that this debt is paid at long last. 
With the full cooperation of my distinguished colleagues Senators Bond and Mikulski, the Senate in July passed an amendment to the VA-HUD appropriations bill which serves as the basis for this bill. That amendment, which was in the legislation that the President signed recently, provided for CBO to estimate the cost of legislation that would add 10 radiogenic diseases to the list of presumptively service-connected diseases for which atomic veterans may be compensated by the VA. The amendment also requires the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee to hold hearings on expanding the list of radiogenic diseases that are presumptively service-connected within 60 days of enactment. To facilitate consideration by the Veterans' Affairs Committee and to secure the support of my colleagues, I'm introducing this bill. 
Mr. President, before I get into the substance of my bill, I want to discuss why I decided to introduce it. First and foremost, I must stress that much of what I know about atomic veterans I've learned from members and families of the Forgotten 216th. The Forgotten 216th refers to the 216th Chemical Service Company of the U.S. Army, which participated in Operation Tumbler Snapper--a series of eight atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the Nevada desert in 1952. About half of the members of the 216th were Minnesotans. Almost 4 years ago, they contacted me after then-Secretary of Energy O'Leary announced that the U.S. Government had conducted radiation experiments on its own citizens. I will never forget my first meeting with members of the Forgotten 216th. It was quite an emotional experience for them as well as for me. For the first time in public, they revealed what went on during the Nevada tests they participated in over 40 years ago, as well as the tragedies and trauma they, their families, and former buddies had experienced since then. 
Since that first dramatic meeting, I've met often with the brave and patriotic members of the Forgotten 216th and their families. They have been and are my mentors. I'm very proud of these extraordinary Minnesotans who have fought hard against great odds for just treatment for atomic veterans and their families. 
Because I believe that their experiences and problems typify that of atomic veterans nationwide, I want to tell my colleagues more about the Forgotten 216th. After you hear their story, I'm confident you'll agree with me that it is imperative that all of us work to ensure the Forgotten 216th and other veterans like them are never forgotten again. 
Mr. President, when they took part in Operation Tumbler Snapper 45 years ago, they believed their Government's assurances that it would keep them out of harm's way, but they have come to believe they were used a guina pigs without concern for their safety. 
Many members of the 216th were sent to measure fallout at or near ground zero immediately after a nuclear blast, exposing them to so much radiation that their Geiger counters went off the scale while they inhaled and ingested radioactive particles. They were given minimal or no protection, sometimes even lacking film badges to measure radiation exposure and provided with no information on the perils they faced. Furthermore, they were sworn to secrecy about their participation in nuclear tests, sometimes denied access to their own service medical records, and provided no medical followup to ensure they'd suffered no ill effects as a result of their exposure to radiation. 
Tragically, many members of the 216th have already died, often of cancer. Moreover, many of their children and even grandchildren have been born with serious and rare disorders, even after they'd had healthy children prior to exposure to radiation. Their claims for VA compensation were denied, often because they were alleged to have been exposed to radiation doses too low to cause disabling illnesses. Since they'd inhaled radioactive dust near Ground Zero shortly after nuclear blasts, they were and are justifiably skeptical about claims that their exposures were insufficient to cause radiogenic diseases. Can anyone really be surprised that these men now refer to themselves as the forgotten 216th?

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on November 7, 1997, the Minnesota State University Student Association [MSUSA] will celebrate its 30th Anniversary of representing Minnesota State University students. 
MSUSA is an advocate organization which was formed in 1967 as an informal coalition of student leaders. Today, it represents more than 60,000 students at Minnesota's state universities in Bemidji, Mankato, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Moorhead, St. Cloud, Marshall, and Winona. 
MSUSA is an independent, nonprofit corporation funded and operated by students. In order to fulfill its main objectives--affordable, quality and accessible State university education--students have taken an activist approach to establish affordable tuition and child care facilities, increase student work study wages, simplify transfer between institutions, improve cultural diversity, and advocate fair State and Federal financial aid programs including those in the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. 
In assisting State university students achieve their goals and voice their concerns, MSUSA provides liaisons to the Governor's office, the legislature, the board of trustees of MnSCU, the Minnesota Higher Education Services Council, the inter faculty organization, Congress, the administration, and the U.S. Department of Education. 
One of MSUSA's most outstanding activities is the Penny Fellowship Program, which encourages students to take a leadership role in serving their communities by performing internships in public and community service. Other noteworthy programs include the MSUSA newspaper, the Monitor, which has the largest circulation of any State system student organization, and the MSUSA Cultural Diversity Project, which fosters understanding and cooperation of students from all cultural backgrounds. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to recognize and congratulate the current officers of MSUSA, who are: Francis Klinkner, State chair from Mankato State University; Garret Melby Aanerud, vice chair from Moorhead State University; and Frank X. Viggiano, executive director. Their hard work on behalf of Minnesota students has led them to many successes, and I'm sure their continuing effort will mean a better-educated and a more productive Minnesota.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from 
North Dakota for his very important leadership in what is really a historic debate. 
Let me say at the beginning that I don't think this is a debate where two positions are either we have walls that we put on the border of our country or we are involved in an international economy. We are a part of an international economy. 
That's a false dichotomy. The question is, Are there any rules that go with this? 
Let me, first of all, start out with one of the major reasons I oppose the motion to proceed to S. 1269, this reciprocal trade agreement of 1997. 
I oppose it on the principle of democracy and representative accountability alone. I am opposed to fast track for that reason alone. It seems to me that we ought to understand that what we are talking about is a trade agreement which will crucially affect the quality or lack of quality of lives of the people that all of us represent, that will affect our domestic laws, everything in the world to do with wage levels, with consumer protection, with environmental protection, and it is difficult for me to understand how we could surrender our rights as Senators to an unlimited debate and the right to amendments to an important piece of legislation, indeed, to some legislation that will come before us, other agreements that will come before us up to the year 2001 that we have not even seen. Before we have even seen these agreements, we are supposed to agree to a procedure whereby we can't come to the floor and fight for the people we represent, we can't come to the floor and try to improve a trade agreement and make it work better for working families in our States. I would oppose this agreement just on this principle alone.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is the role of national governments to establish the rules within which companies and countries trade. That is what trade agreements do. They set strict rules. If, for example, a country does not enforce respect for patents, trade sanctions can be invoked. 
Mr. President, you can bet that U.S. companies get right in the face of our negotiators to make sure that the rules in these agreements which protect their interests are ironclad and will be strictly enforced. That is what companies do. You can be absolutely sure that U.S. companies would laugh in the face of negotiators if they were told that their concerns were legitimate but could be pursued just as seriously in less enforceable side agreements. 
My point, Mr. President, is that it is fine to represent the interests of the companies. We should do so. But we are also elected to represent other people in our country, not just large multinational corporations. We are elected to represent the majority of people. 
I say, Mr. President, that we should take a very strong interest not only in representing the majority of people in our country but also in representing a lot of people, ordinary citizens, wage earners, ordinary people in the countries we trade with. Because if they do not make enough money to demand the products that we produce, then we are not going to do well. 
Mr. President, I think this fast-track agreement, which extends on to NAFTA and GATT, is deeply skewed toward large corporate interests. That has been our recent experience with trade agreements. And I want to talk a little bit about what has happened with NAFTA. 
NAFTA has been in operation for 3 years. And we heard a lot about what NAFTA was going to do for all of us. 
We have an opportunity now to look at the results with NAFTA. They include loss of jobs, suppression of wages, and the weakening of food, safety, and pollution laws. 
Mr. President, if we repeat these mistakes, we are only going to condemn ourselves to replicate some of NAFTA's worst measurable consequences. Let me draw for colleagues from a respected Economic Policy Institute report. This report was issued in September of this year and titled `NAFTA and the States: Job Destruction is Widespread.' EI's study concluded that `an exploding deficit in net exports with Mexico and Canada has eliminated 394,835 U.S. jobs since NAFTA took effect in 1994.' The report argues that this job loss contributed significantly to a 4-percent decline in real median wages in the United States since 1993. Minnesota, according to this report, lost about 6,500 jobs due to the NAFTA-related trade deficit between 1993 and 1996, contributing to about a 3.8 percent drop in real median wages. 
Mr. President, last month the Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair Economy published a study which tracked the performance and actions of a number of companies which belong to a major corporate coalition which is advocating passage of fast track. The study found that the 40 companies which are members of the America Leads on Trade coalition, from whom all of our offices have received pro-fast-track materials regularly, cut jobs in 89 U.S. plants under NAFTA. The study also documents that almost 13,000 workers who were laid off by members of this coalition, America Leads on Trade, qualified for NAFTA retraining assistance. And while jobs were being cut by these firms, these firms' profits soared and the salaries of their CEO's were significantly higher than those of executives in other leading firms. 
Mr. President, again, looking at the record with NAFTA, according to Public Citizen in a report released in September of this year, U.S. food imports have skyrocketed while U.S. inspections of imported food have declined significantly. The report charges that `imports of Mexican crops documented by the U.S. Government to be at high risk of pesticide contamination have dramatically increased under NAFTA, while inspection has decreased.' 
Mr. President, our experience with NAFTA can't be dismissed. Jobs and wages in the United States have gone down. We have this paradox over the last 20 years of workers' productivity going up but real wages going down. Wages have gone down in Mexico, too, despite the fact that some workers in Mexico are performing high-skill, high-productivity labor. Our trade balance has dramatically worsened with respect to Mexico. This is all in the last 3 years, post-NAFTA agreement, and the number of U.S. firms that have not only relocated to Mexico but just as importantly have threatened to relocate to Mexico have effectively held wages down. Mr. President, this is a classic tactic used in any effort to organize--companies just simply saying, `We will go to Mexico.' 
Violations of fundamental democratic rights--we care about those rights--as well as basic human and labor rights continue to occur regularly in Mexico. And a NAFTA side agreement has not significantly improved Mexico's environment--the environment degradation goes on at the Maquiladoras--nor have they done anything to raise the wages or living standards of the people. When I visited the Maquiladora I thought the environmental degradation was horrifying. I could not believe little children that I saw working in the plants. When I talked to people, they were quite often terrified to even talk to a U.S. Senator for fear of losing their job. 
Mr. President, I simply will say it one more time, we should be engaged in trade agreements, we should be a vital part of an international economy, and we are, but we can do it without injuring people in communities in our country and we can do it without injuring people in communities in other countries if we have the inclusion of enforceable labor rights and environmental provisions right in the agreements themselves. We don't have any like that in this fast-track proposal. 
Mr. President, I said at the beginning that I wouldn't support this agreement on the principle of democracy alone. To lock ourselves into trade agreements up to the year 2001--other countries in Latin America, Caribbean countries, Asian countries--without even knowing what those agreements will entail, to not be able to come out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and introduce amendments to fight for people in your State or South Carolina or Iowa or Washington or any other State, I think denies us as Senators what is really the most cherished and I think most sacred responsibility we have, which is the responsibility to be out here fighting for people. 
These trade agreements affect the quality of life of people in Minnesota and all across the country. I believe that in the absence of, as a part of this trade agreement, clear fair labor standards and environmental standards and human rights standards, these trade agreements will continue to do exactly what NAFTA has done--depress the living standards of people in the United States and people in other countries, lead to further violation of human rights in other countries, not do one positive thing about environmental degradation, and ultimately it will be a good deal for large multinational corporations and a very bad deal for the people in Minnesota and the people across the country. 
Mr. President, by way of conclusion, I oppose this agreement because of the fast-track procedure alone. I think it is profoundly antidemocratic. I oppose it because of the empirical evidence that has come in about NAFTA. It is quite clear to me this will lead to a depressing of living standards of people in our country and people in other countries. And finally, Mr. President, I oppose this agreement not because I am not an internationalist. I am the son of a Jewish immigrant from Russia. I am an internationalist. We are in an international economy. I want our country to lead the way. But I want the United States of America to lead the way as an economic power in this international economy by advocating our values. Our values respect human dignity, our values respect human rights, our values respect protecting children's lives, our values respect the environment, and our values respect fair labor working conditions for people. That is what is lacking in this agreement. That is why I am in such profound opposition to it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to address the direction of our country's relationship with China. Right now, the Clinton administration is busy with the state visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. A state visit is the highest, most formal diplomatic event hosted by the United States. The champagne will flow, and flattering toasts will be made. 
I disagree with this red carpet treatment, Mr. President. There is no question that United States-Chinese relations are crucial and important for both countries. It is wrong, however, for the United States to host a state visit for President Jiang Zemin until we see significant progress made on human rights in China. Instead of a ceremonial visit, we should be holding a working visit with the Chinese leadership, focusing on the critical issues that exist between our two nation, like human rights, weapons proliferation, and trade. 
China continues to wage a war against individual freedoms and human rights. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of dissidents and advocates of political reform were detained just last year. They included human rights and pro-democracy activists, and members of religious groups. Many have been sentenced to long prison terms where they have been beaten, tortured, and denied medical care. 
Scores of Roman Catholics and Protestants were arrested. A crack-down in Tibet was carried out during the `Strike Hard' campaign. Authorities ordered the closure of monasteries in Tibet and banned the Dalai Lama's image. At one monastery which was closed, over 90 monks and novices were detained or disappeared. 
Harry Wu, a man of extraordinary courage and character, has documented China's extensive forced labor system. His research has identified more than 1,100 labor camps across China, many of which produce products for export to dozens of countries around the world, including the United States. 
Because he criticized his government, Harry Wu was also imprisoned in these camps. For 19 years in 12 different forced labor camps across China, Harry was forced to mine coal, manufacture chemicals, and build roads. He survived beatings, torture, and starvation. He witnessed the death of many of his fellow prisoners from brutality, disease, starvation, and suicide. 
According to Amnesty International, throughout China, mass summary executions continue to be carried out. At least 6,000 death sentences and 3,500 executions were officially recorded last year. The real figures are believed to be much higher. 
Our own State Department reported that in 1996: `All public dissent against the party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administration detention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.' 
Mr. President, that is a chilling, deeply disturbing statement. It cuts to the core values of our Nation. And it was made by our own Government, and this administration. Yet, this week, the administration will welcome President Jiang with pomp and circumstance. These actions indicate that, where China is concerned, what we have is not a policy of constructive engagement, but one of unconditional engagement. 
Let us put some names and human faces to the statistics and generalities we have all heard with regards to China. 
In May 1996, Wang Hui was detained. She was the wife of a jailed labor activist. While detained, she was denied water and other liquids. She tried to kill herself by hanging. According to Human Rights Watch, after being cut down by police, she was punished with severe beating. 
Ngawang Choephel is a Fulbright Scholar from Middlebury College. He studied music, and returned to his homeland to document the ancient music and culture of Tibet. It is disappearing under the heel of the Chinese Government. As a result of his work, he was convicted in February, and sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for espionage. His crime--sending videotapes of ethnic Tibetan music and dancing out of China. 
Last year, Wang Dan was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges of conspiring to subvert the Chinese Government. Prior to sentencing, Wang had already been held 17 months in incommunicado detention. His crime: He was a leader of the Tiananmen movement. 
Two years ago, Beijing sentenced Wei Jingsheng to 14 more years of incarceration for the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and political reform. Wei had been arrested and sentenced after he wrote wall posters on the Democracy Wall outside Beijing. They argued for true democracy and denounced Deng Xiaoping. 
I have read Mr. Wei's work and his letter from prison. I can't tell you how impressed and moved I was by them. As a political scientist, I seldom, if ever, have read such an eloquent and intelligent espousal of democracy and human rights. Making the letters all the more remarkable is the fact that they were written while Wei was in prison or labor camps, mostly in solitary confinement. He has been jailed for all but 6 months of the last 18 years. 
Wei Jingshen is not only China's most prominent dissident and prisoner of conscience, but ranks with the greatest fighters for democracy and human rights of this century. He brings to mind Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela, and, of course, Alexander Solzhenitsyn. I was honored to join many of my colleagues in nominating Wei for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Last week, Mr. Wei's sister came to the United States to tell the administration that he is dying in jail, and that this summit may be his last chance of emerging from detention alive. It is urgent that the Chinese Government release Wei and that he be given the medical care that he desperately needs, but has been denied. 
By agreeing to this state visit without any significant concessions on human rights, like the release of Wei Jingsheng, the Clinton administration squandered its strongest source of leverage with Beijing. 
This is not to say that all dialog between the United States and China or that working level visits are wrong. Instead, I believe that the symbolism of a state level visit is inappropriate given our strong disagreement with China over its human rights record. That is why I cosponsored a resolution with Senators Feingold and Helms to urge the President to downgrade this event from a state visit to working visit. 
The Chinese have said they do not welcome American advice on what they view as a `purely internal affair.' Welcome or not, President Clinton must insist that China's leaders take specific actions on human rights. 
Indeed, I believe strongly that the administration has a moral duty to press a range of issues with the Chinese Government that it may not welcome, but that are of enormous important to the Chinese people, and the United States. 
Specifically, I call on President Clinton to demand: 
The immediate and unconditional release of Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, and other prisoners of conscience held in jails in China and Tibet. 
Improvement in the conditions under which political, religious, and labor dissidents are detained in China and Tibet. This includes providing prisoners with adequate medical care and allowing international humanitarian agencies access to detention facilities. 
Significant progress in improving the overall human rights conditions in China and Tibet. The Chinese Government must take concrete steps to increase freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of association, in order to comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which it signed in 1948. 
Some say that we cannot influence what goes on in China, that the country is too proud, too large, and that changes take too long. I disagree. For years we have pressured the Chinese on human rights, and to let up now is tantamount to defeat for the cause of human justice. Dissidents who have been freed and come to the United States have thanked advocates for keeping them alive, by keeping the pressure on, and focusing attention on their plight. 
As Americans, it is our duty and in our interest to make the extra effort required to promote freedom and democracy in China, and to bring it into compliance with international standards on human rights. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation that the Senate may soon consider. The number of this bill is S. 270; it is the Texas low-level radioactive waste disposal compact bill. 
As my colleagues know, the Congress is supposed to consent to all interstate compacts, which are contractual arrangements between States. In this case, we are asked to give our consent to the shipment of low-level nuclear waste from Maine and Vermont, and potentially other States, to Texas for disposal. I am opposed to this legislation as it is currently written. I want to make clear today what my intentions are. 
Mr. President, we will have further opportunity to debate this legislation in full, and I do not intend to engage the bill's supporters today. I certainly never intend for this to become an acrimonious or bitter debate. But I want to publicly explain my opposition to this legislation and also what I intend to do. 
I do not believe that it is the intention of the bill's sponsors, my good friends from Maine and Vermont, to do anything to harm the citizens of Sierra Blanca, TX, through this compact. My friends from New England are attempting to meet the concerns of their constituents. They just want to get rid of this nuclear waste and they want to figure out how to dispose of it. They want to get it out of their own States. I also understand that no one wants to have a nuclear waste dump in their neighborhood. 
Now, this compact legislation says little about where the waste should go in Texas, other than that the State of Texas has an obligation to find a site. The State legislature in Texas has decided that there indeed will be a site and it will be in a small town in Hudspeth County, TX. My friends from Maine and Vermont, with whom I agree on many issues, and whom I enjoy working with, have not said that their State's nuclear waste should go to Sierra Blanca. But the effect of this legislation is to create a low-level nuclear waste dump site in a dusty little town in Texas called Sierra Blanca near the border with Mexico, about 60 miles east of El Paso. 
Mr. President, I believe that there are many concerns that have been raised about the siting of this dump and the enactment of this legislation, including environmental issues, seismic problems, economic viability, current legal actions, and our relations with Mexico. 
But I want to talk about one issue and one issue only, and hold what may be the first debate we have ever had on the floor of the U.S. Senate that deals with environmental justice, which is a shorthand way of talking about the disproportionate exposure of ethnic minorities and poor people to environmental pollutants. That is to say, all too often, when it comes to where we site these nuclear waste dump sites or where we put an incinerator, we tend to locate them in communities where there is a disproportionate number of people of color or poor people because they don't have the political clout. 
Why do I raise the issue of environmental justice on a bill that professes to do no more than grant the Congress' consent to a compact between Maine, Vermont, and Texas for the disposal of nuclear waste? Because it is this bill which will enable Maine and 
Vermont to indeed ship nuclear waste to Texas--and I understand why they are trying to do it--but also because Texas has made it very clear where it intends to locate the dump site. That dump site, not surprisingly, is located in an area of west Texas that is populated disproportionately by poor Hispanics. This happens over and over and over again in our country. When we want to figure out where we are going to put the nuclear waste, we look to where the poor people live, to where communities of color without the economic clout live, and that is where we put it. 
Is the proposed location of the dump in a poor community simply a coincidence, I ask my colleagues? Was it chance that the dry, sparsely populated county in Texas tentatively chosen for the dump site is 66 percent Hispanic with 39 percent of the people living below the poverty level? There certainly were other scientifically acceptable sites for the dump, so why did the Texas Legislature choose this spot, the sixth poorest county in Texas, with a high minority population, a low median household income and a sludge dump? 
The answer to these questions is simple. We in this body understand the answer to this question all too well. It was politics. The community living near the site singled out by the Texas Legislature did not have the political clout to keep it out. While all the other candidate sites were able to deflect the dump, Sierra Blanca, in far western Texas, a poor community, a Hispanic community, did not pack the political punch of the communities near the other possible sites. 
Another question that has arisen is, why am I, as a Senator from Minnesota, involving myself in the decision of the Texas Legislature to select a particular Texas site for a nuclear waste dump? For this reason, colleagues: It doesn't just happen in Texas, it happens all over this country. Poor and minority communities, unable to protect themselves in the political arena, find the old plumber's maxim is as true as ever: `Waste flows downhill,' both figuratively and literally, and if you are at the bottom of the socioeconomic slope, the pollution lands on you. 
That is what this is all about. That is what this cry for environmental justice is all about. I predict that eventually environmental justice will become a huge issue in the Congress. To repeat, it is the old plumber's maxim that `waste flows downhill, both figuratively and literally, and if you are at the bottom of the socioeconomic slope, the pollution lands on you.' 
I am standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate today to say that enough is enough. Until more of us say enough and we face up to the environmental injustices that we may contribute to in the granting of our consent in legislation such as this, poor and minority communities will continue to suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation in our country. We are in desperate need in the United States of America of a meaningful dialog on environmental justice. I believe Americans understand the need for fairness, and I want Americans to understand that we have to address environmental justice whenever we think about how to deal with problems like waste disposal. All our actions have moral implications, and what we decide on legislation like this can ultimately harm our most vulnerable citizens. 
I intend, Mr. President, to have a full debate on environmental justice. I want Members to explain why we should overlook the environmental justice implications of our actions in this instance. I want to talk about how this situation is symptomatic of many situations that we face in our country today. I want the U.S. Senate, as a body, to reflect on the consequences of pollution on poor and minority citizens all across the United States of America. I also intend to offer an amendment which adds one additional condition to Congress' consent to the compact. That condition is essentially that Congress grants its consent as long as the compact is not implemented in a way that it discriminates on the basis of race, color, national origin, or income level. Specifically, it will be designed to allow people who don't have the chance to fight fairly in the political process to make their case in the courts. I want to give poor and minority people, communities of color, a chance to fight this out in the courts. 
That is the very point of environmental justice. When the political process fails, environmental justice means trying to level the playing field, sometimes forcing conflict into a more evenhanded forum in this country. In this particular case, that would be the courts. I am sure, Mr. President, that none of our colleagues would argue that it is acceptable to discriminate against people by locating a nuclear waste dump site in their community. That being the case, it is a simple matter to say that if the location of the compact dump discriminates against people on the basis of their race or economic status, Congress will not consent to this compact. That will be the amendment I will bring to the floor if this compact is brought to the floor. I think this will happen and we will have this debate, and I think it will not be an acrimonious debate, but it will be one of the first debates we have ever had in the Senate on environmental justice or environmental injustice. 
I would like to make one point crystal clear. I am not rising in opposition to compacts. My amendment does not pass judgment on the compact this bill attempts to create. Rather, it is designed to give the citizens of Sierra Blanca, a poor Hispanic community, another tool to have their voices heard above a political process that would just as soon ignore them. I hope my colleagues will recognize our obligation to the people of Sierra Blanca and to all our citizens in taking a stand for environmental justice. 
Mr. President, I look forward to this debate. I will bring to the floor documents and other information for discussion. I will raise important questions as a Senator. It will be a civil debate, but I feel very strongly about this. What has happened to the people of Sierra Blanca, or what might happen to them, is all too indicative of what happens all too often to those communities that are the poorest communities, communities of color that over and over and over again are asked to carry the disproportionate burden of environmental degradation. It is not fair to these citizens. It is not fair to their children. It is not fair to their families. It is not fair to their communities. I believe this is a fundamentally important question that we have to address as an institution, as the Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. For the moment, I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to comment on what is a challenge unique in human history that we face as a nation, and I am talking about global warming. It is unique because we have to make important decisions without a visible crisis staring us in the face. 
In the 1970's, we had the long gas lines, we had two oil price shocks, the taking of hostages by a revolutionary mob in Iran, and that spurred our Nation to reduce its reliance on oil. And in the 1960's and the 1970's we had the dark clouds of particulates and the smog that smothered urban areas which moved us to clean up the air. Today, we are faced with a potentially greater threat, but it is not a visible threat. We are talking about something that is going to happen, something that is going to affect our children and their children, and the question is what are we going to do? It is a challenge for my State of Minnesota. It is a challenge for our country. It is a challenge for the whole human race. It is also a challenge about leadership. I am talking about the problem of global warming, the problem of climate change. 
In 1992, for the Earth summit, President Bush made a commitment to return greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000, and we have not lived up to that commitment. We have not honored that commitment. I believe the President, in 1993, made a similar commitment that we would reduce our greenhouse gases to the 1990 level by the year 2000. 
I believe that the President's announcement today will fall far short of meeting this challenge--but I certainly want to say to the President and to the White House that I appreciate their efforts to try to move this process forward as we move toward a very important international gathering in Kyoto. 
For more than a decade, the scientific community has investigated the issue. Initially, its reports called for more research, better modeling techniques, more data. But in December 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of more than 2,000 scientists from more than 100 countries, concluded that there was a discernible human impact on global climate. In 
June, more than 2,000 U.S. scientists, including Nobel laureates, signed the Scientists' Statement on Global Disruption, which reads in part that the accumulation of greenhouse gases commits the Earth irreversibly to further global climate change and consequent ecological, economic and social disruption. 
Mr. President, I believe as a Senator from Minnesota that we have reached a point where unduly delaying action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is foolhardy and it is tantamount to betrayal of our future generations. We know what this is going to do. The consequences can be catastrophic for our country and for the world, and I believe that the President and the United States of America have to do better in addressing this challenge. 
What has saddened me about this debate is that I believe we should be below 1990 levels certainly before the year 2010. I believe our country should make a commitment to meeting these kind of targets. I think the evidence shows that as opposed to being on the defensive, we should be proactive, and the very bridge the President talks about building to the next century is going to be a bridge that combines a sustainable environment with sustainable energy with a sustainable economy. I think the country that is the most clean country is going to be the country with an economy powered by clean technologies, industries and businesses. It is going to be a country run with an emphasis on energy efficiency and with a renewable energy policy. It is going to be a country which will generate far more jobs in the renewable energy and clean technology sectors, which are labor intensive, small business intensive and community building sectors. 
We have an opportunity as we move into the next millennium to really create a new marriage between our environment and our economy. We are all but strangers and guests on this land, as the Catholic bishops have said. We have to take action now. What the President is calling for is not likely to be enough to address this challenge and the task before us. We can do better as a nation. We can be more respectful of our environment while still growing our economy. 
In the Red River Valley, the people of North Dakota and people of Minnesota went through a living hell this past winter and spring. We don't want the floods in the Red River Valley to be 5-year occurrences. And there will be other catastrophic consequences from global warming. For my State it could be agricultural devastation; for my State it could be deforestation and lower lake levels in the Boundary Waters, an area that we love, a crown jewel wilderness area in northern Minnesota. 
The more important point, however, is that not only for ourselves but for our children and grandchildren we need to take much stronger action. We have to stand up to some of the powerful forces that are saying no to a meaningful treaty. We have to lay out a proactive, positive agenda which makes it crystal clear that energy efficiency and renewable energy and clean technologies will create many more small businesses and many more jobs for our country. This marriage between our economy and our environment would respect the environment, respect the economy, and would give us an energy policy that is much more productive and positive, while helping us to build and sustain our communities and our country. 
I am disappointed in the position the President seems to have taken on targets and timetables for climate change action. I hope as we move forward toward an international treaty, our country will take a stronger negotiating position. We need to be the leaders of the world in meeting what I think is perhaps the most profound environmental challenge which we have ever faced. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for his strong words. He has been a very strong reformer in the Senate. 
Mr. President, let me try to not repeat the arguments that have already been made on the floor and instead draw from conversation that my wife Sheila and I have had with people in cafes in Minnesota. We had the opportunity, in August, to spend about a week just dropping in cafes in the morning around breakfasttime and lunchtime and just talking with people and listening to what people had to say. I say to my colleagues that one disturbing conclusion from these discussions with people is that I think many people in our country, certainly many Minnesotans, are now pretty well convinced that way too much of politics, way too much of Government is dominated by wealthy people and special interests, that too few people have way too much wealth, power, and say and that too many people--that is to say the majority of people--are locked out. 
Mr. President, in the cafes in Minnesota, quite often people would say to us: When it comes to our concerns, Paul and Sheila, about affordable child care, jobs and decent wages, and affordable health care, about the power of insurance companies, the way in which we are denied coverage, about the concentration of power in banking, about the concentration of power in agriculture, about affordable education, when it comes to our concerns, we don't think our concerns are of much concern in the Halls of the Congress. 
I think the main reason that people have reached this conclusion is that they are so disillusioned about all the ways in which they see big money dominating politics. Indeed, I think that is the ethical issue of our time. 
Mr. President, so that nobody has any illusions here, I don't think that people view this as corruption as in the wrongdoing of individual officeholders, but they view it as systemic. They really believe that there is an imbalance of power where the wealthy few and powerful interests pretty much dominate the political process. Mr. President, you know what? I think they are right. I don't think it is just a perception. I think they are absolutely right. 
If you believe in representative democracy, then you believe in the idea that each person counts as one and no more than one. We don't have that any longer. We have auction block democracy, Government going to the highest bidder. People are disillusioned. That is the meaning of the last election, where over 50 percent of the people in the country didn't even vote. The party of the disaffected is the largest party in our country. Therefore, I don't understand, for the life of me, why my colleagues on the majority side introduced an amendment--the majority leader introduces an amendment which basically destroys this campaign reform effort. 
Now, Mr. President, I want to thank Senators McCain and Feingold for their very strong leadership. I think this is the most important issue before us. I think it is the core question; it is the core issue. Every year since I have been here in the Senate, I fought it out on these reform issues because I really think this goes to the very heart of whether or not we really have a democracy or whether we just have a pseudodemocracy. What we have before us really is not the 
McCain-Feingold original formula, but the extra-mild version, which I don't think has enough zing in it, but at least it represents a step forward. With the McCain-Feingold effort here, we have a ban on soft money contributions to the parties. This is the sort of unaccountable money, if you will. We have in addition, some real standards on this issue advocacy--and this has been gone over, which is a terribly important part of this legislation--and by the way, if you ban soft money to the parties and don't do anything about the issue ads, really psuedofake ads, the money will just shift there, and in addition, you have some standards dealing with tighter standards dealing with independent expenditures. So it is a step forward. That is why we should pass it. 
My hope is that it will whet the appetite of people in the country for more because the truth of the matter is, in the spirit of compromise, the one provision that was actually dropped--that is why we have McCain-Feingold extra-mild now, it had do with us, with reducing the amount of money spent in campaigns in Senate races. I mean, I thought that was the most important part that we would somehow reduce the amount of money spent in exchange for discounts when it comes to access to TV time or direct mailing, you name it. 
Now, Mr. President, I mean, I think the criteria ought to be, let's stop this obscene money chase, let's stop the obscene amount of money all of us have to spend and the time we have to spend raising money. Let's lessen the special interest access and influence. There is way too much of that. The vast majority of people really are locked out of this process, and let's try and have a level playing field, where challengers have a shot at winning. By that criteria, the McCain-Feingold bill doesn't go far enough. But if this piece of legislation is passed--and that is why it is such an important bill, even this stripped-down version is so important--people in the country, I think, will say, look, the Congress has finally taken some action. This is a step forward. 
People aren't fools. People aren't going to see this legislation as the be all and end all. They are not going to see it as Heaven on Earth, as ending all special interest access; they are not going to see it as ending the huge amounts of money spent in politics. But people will see it as a step forward. I say to my colleagues that what we have here when it comes to the majority leader's amendment--quite frankly, I am surprised that some of my colleagues in the majority party have essentially followed the lead of this amendment. I hope they won't. If we have a vote that is going to be very revealing. 
If in fact people vote for this Lott amendment and continue to insist that it became part of a reform bill knowing that it is, as everyone has said, the `poison pill' amendment, then we may very well have no reform bill passed at all. 
So this becomes a vote which tells people in the country where all of us stand and on what side each party stands on when it comes to this fundamental question of reform. 
If we come here this afternoon and what we have happen is that we have the Lott amendment out there--I don't know why we can't have a separate vote on the Lott amendment. I thought we would. I think we can vote it down. If that doesn't happen, then there is no cloture, and then we go to the McCain-Feingold bill and we can't get cloture, that is blocked by Senators in the majority party, then what happens is we again reach an impasse, and people in the country become disillusioned. 
As a Democrat, I will just say to the Members of the majority party that, frankly, I think people will be very angry. I think they will not appreciate this amendment. I think they will not appreciate the effort on the part of the majority leader to kill campaign finance reform. But I would say, not as a Democrat but as a Minnesotan, as an American citizen, ultimately we all lose. If we do not take advantage of this moment in time where we can pass a reform bill, albeit it still doesn't do enough, then we will be making a huge mistake, and this will just add to the disillusion of the people in the country. 
The good news is that we can pass a reform bill. I hope we do. I hope we do not squander this opportunity. The good news is that all around the country there is a lot of energy for reform. 
I introduced a bill with Senator Kerry which is a clean-election, clean-money option which essentially gets all of the private money out of politics. It is really strong. People in Maine have supported it. People in Vermont have now supported it. There are going to be initiatives around the country on this. There is a lot of energy in States all across the country. So I think people in the country are going to continue to put the pressure on. 
But we ought not to miss this opportunity to do something good. We ought not to miss this opportunity to at least begin to make some changes in the way in which all of this money is spent on politics. We ought not to miss this opportunity to pass the McCain-Feingold bill and give people in the country a clear message that we hear them. We ought not to miss this opportunity for reform. We ought not to miss this opportunity to reassure people in the country that we are committed to a political process that is more open, with more integrity--and not just the heavy hitters, the big givers, the invested and the well-connected running the show. We better not miss this opportunity. 
I say to my colleagues in the majority party that I hope some of you will have the courage to vote against this Lott amendment, if we have that chance, or have the courage to join us and pass the McCain-Feingold bill, which would be a historically significant step in the right direction in leading our country toward more democracy, toward more participation and more involvement as opposed to this awful system we have right now which absolutely needs to be changed. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank both my colleagues, Senator Kohl from Wisconsin and Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell from Colorado, for their fine work. 
Let me, first of all, say, Mr. President, I understand this is a conference committee report, we will have a vote on it and there are many, many good things in this bill. I understand the good work of all Senators. I also want to express my personal gratitude to Representative Bernie Sanders in the House and Senator Harkin for a provision, with the support of my colleagues, that they now have in this bill which really puts our country on the side of taking some action against coerced child labor in other countries. I think it is a terribly important provision, and I am very pleased to see this provision in this conference report, Mr. President. 
So it is with a little bit of regret that I speak against this bill. I intend to vote against it, though, again, I want to make it clear why because there are a lot of good things in the bill. 
When we had this bill before us in the Senate, I had sent a letter out to colleagues saying that I thought it was not appropriate for us to take a pay increase, cost-of-living increase, salary increase, whatever you want to call it, which I would raise our salaries to about $136,000. I sent a letter to all my colleagues, and then we in the Senate voice voted for the proposition that we would delete that pay increase. So the Senate took a position when we voice voted that we are not going to have a recorded vote because there is unanimity, there is a consensus in the Senate, that this cost-of-living adjustment for Members is not the right thing to do. I regret to say that in the conference committee we did not keep this pay increase out of this legislation. So now we are here today with the pay increase. 
Now, a filibuster is beside the point. There is much in this bill that is very good. It is going to pass. I understand that. But I want to go on record as a Senator from Minnesota about this pay increase, not to talk about the process, though I must say I think my colleagues have done a pretty good job of not being recorded for or against this pay increase. 
To me, there is something more important. That is why I speak in the Senate this morning and why I am going to vote against this conference report. I hope other Senators will as well. I put the cost-of-living increase or pay increase for Senators and Representatives in the context of the debate that we have had on the floor of the Senate over the last several years. I have traveled in the country and spent a lot of time in poor communities, and I cannot even begin to tell you the number of Head Start teachers who tell me how important early Head Start is, how it would make so much difference if they could have a chance to work with kids when they are 1 and 2 years of age to give them a head start. We have a pittance of funding for that. We say we do not have any more money for it, and yet we give ourselves a salary increase. 
I cannot begin to describe the conversations that I have had with people all across the country about child care, affordable child care, which by the way is not just a problem for low-income people, but is a problem for middle-income and moderate-income families as well. 
Again, we have made precious little investment in children for child care but we give ourselves this salary increase. 
I was at the University of Iowa on Monday and there I found a focus on Pell grants. I can't tell you how many people in the higher education communities say, `Look, by doing so little by way of expanding Pell grants--yes, you did the tax deductions and tax credits--you are still not dealing with the students most in need.' Expansion of the Pell grant is by far the most effective way to do this. We say we cannot do it, but we give ourselves a salary increase. 
Mr. President, most poignantly of all, or at least most poignant to me, we voted not long ago for some $50 billion in deficit reduction, and the two major programs that we targeted were, first, the Food Stamp Program, which is the major safety net program in this country when it comes to nutrition for children; and second, benefits for legal immigrants. Now, we have restored some of the benefits, though, again, we still have eliminated food and nutrition assistance for legal immigrants, and by the year 2002 there will be a 20 percent cut in food assistance for children. 
Over 50 percent of the cuts we have made come from the Food Stamp Program, which is the major food nutrition program in this country and is our major safety net program. This is the program that has led to a significant reduction in malnutrition and hunger among children, and yet we said that in the name of sacrifice and in the name of deficit reduction and in the name of tightening our belt that we would cut the major nutrition programs for children in America, and at the same time we are now about to vote for a conference report that gives ourselves a salary increase, putting our salaries over $136,000 a year. 
I don't think a salary increase is appropriate, Mr. President. I just don't think it is appropriate. That is my own view. I have had a chance to come to the floor of the Senate and express that view honestly, openly and directly. I expressed that view in the letter I sent to my colleagues before this ever came out of the Senate. I sent another letter to conferees saying, please stick to the Senate position. We had a unanimous vote in the Senate to stop this pay increase and yet we still now have the increase in this piece of legislation. 
I just don't see the justice of it, colleagues. I don't see how we can cut basic benefits to the most needy and vulnerable citizens in this country--food and nutrition benefits for children in the name of belt tightening, sacrifice and deficit reduction--and at the same time give ourselves a salary increase, putting our salary over $136,000 a year. I don't think it is appropriate. I don't think it is the right thing to do. 
As good a job as both colleagues have done on this piece of legislation, I will vote against this bill and I hope other colleagues will as well. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. This is less in the spirit of a question, but I want to make it clear to my colleague, because I appreciate what he said, I have no objection to increases for other programs for children in the Government, and I understand full well some of the important programs in this piece of legislation. 
That is not my quarrel. My quarrel is the proposition that we did not eliminate the pay increase for ourselves. And I think we should have included increases for the other programs I spoke about.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to pick up on some comments made by the Senator from California. First of all, I express my disappointment that we are really not debating this campaign finance reform bill. There are a lot of games that are being played right now. 
What we have--my colleague from California was saying there is no reason to talk about filling up the tree and poison pill provisions--but what we have going on here is an amendment introduced by the majority leader that has an Orwellian title called the Paycheck Protection Act. It is really kind of a union label working people gag act. In any case, it is a killer amendment and has no business being on this bill. 
Senator Daschle, the minority leader, has said if the majority leader wants to have a debate on this division provision, we will deal with it separately. We will agree to a debate on it. We will have amendments and we will deal with it. 
But what is going on right now is that this amendment and this effort to fill up the tree means that there is no way in which other Senators can introduce amendments. For that matter, I don't see us having much of a debate. I am hopeful we will get back to this debate. 
I want to be clear with people in the country that the fact that you have a campaign finance reform bill hanging out there on the Senate calendar, I guess starting at the end of last week and yesterday, Monday, doesn't necessarily mean we have really a high-quality debate. I am not even going to speak that long because I want to wait for colleagues to come out here on the other side and have a full-scale debate on this piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, we are very close to passing a reform bill. In many ways I am pessimistic because I think this amendment that the majority leader has introduced is an amendment which may very well destroy our chances for passing reform legislation if it passes. On the other hand, I think people in the country are pretty smart about this. I think they see it for what it is. My hope is that there will be a few more Republicans that will join Senator McCain and Senator Collins and Senator Thompson and Senator Specter and we will have the ability to defeat this amendment and then go on to the McCain-Feingold bill. 
I am willing to admit people have different views about how to solve this problem. I am convinced this is the core problem. I don't think there is a more important issue. I think people in the country know it. The problem is that people hate this system and they know it, and I think they believe that Government too often responds to the interests of the wealthy and powerful and not them. I think they are probably right. Even though I think individuals here in the Senate and the House have a highly developed sense of public service, people can agree to disagree, but systematically you have a huge imbalance of power because this whole political process has become too dependent on the heavy hitters and the investors and the givers and the people who have a whole lot of money. That tilts the system in a very dangerous direction toward the very top of the population, and it leaves the vast majority of people out. 
It also means we have a very, if you will, distorted debate on issues. I don't think it is any accident that ultimately when it came down to how we did deficit reduction, a good part of many of the areas we made reductions in affected vulnerable people, low- and moderate-income people who are not the big givers. I don't think it is any accident we left most of the tax loopholes and tax deductions alone, because then we would have had to take on the big givers. I don't think it is any accident that there are a whole lot of questions that deal with concentration of power. I will take the telecommunications industry, since I think we made a big mistake when we passed that piece of legislation. I think the flow of information in a democracy is the most precious thing we have, but in a way this whole issue of concentration of power gets taken off the table. 
I don't think it is any accident when we were debating universal health care coverage very fine Senators would say to me, `There is no way we can take on the insurance industry given the power of the insurance industry.' 
This is very corrupting in a very systematic way--not in an individual way, but in a very systematic way. I just say I think if we don't get the job done or if we don't at least get half the job done or if we at least don't get a quarter of the job done, I think people will be disillusioned 
and they will have a right to be. We will have given them every justification, every reason for being disillusioned with us. 
Now, Senator McCain and Senator Feingold are both close colleagues and good friends. Senator Feingold is my colleague from the State of Wisconsin. We have all worked together on these reform issues. I was proud to be one of the original cosponsors of the bill with Senator Thompson. What we had was an original--it's a little like hot sauce; we have the McCain-Feingold original formula, and we have the McCain-Feingold extra mild, which is the new formulation. The extra mild is meant to get us past the filibuster and any diversion from the majority side, and I hope it does. But I have to say that I don't even think the extra mild has enough zing in it. I know this is a good-faith effort to move us forward. 
Let me talk in very concrete terms about what all this means for people in the country. I will get back to this in a more extensive way when we have the debate. What has already been dropped out, I think, is a shame. I think Senators Feingold and McCain are disappointed, but they are trying to move forward on some reform. What has been dropped out of this is the agreed-upon spending limits, reducing the amount of money that is spent in exchange for discount broadcast advertising time and direct mailing expenses. 
In other words, the very part of the legislation that actually would have reduced the amount of money spent in our races, Senate and House races, has been taken out. Actually, the one provision of this bill that I think would have led to a more level playing field has been taken out already. I think that is a shame. The reason that I got so involved in this whole debate about reform from the word go was because I just think an obscene amount of money is spent. The reason I got involved was, back in 1989 and part of 1990, it was so disillusioning to me to have just about everybody I talked to tell me I didn't have a chance to win because I didn't have access to the money. That is all people would talk about. 
Actually, the provision of this legislation that directly deals with our raising money and our spending money in our campaigns and the connection to how we vote--even though I think all of us hope there is no connection, it certainly looks that way to people--has already been taken out. What is in this piece of legislation that I think is important--there is one provision I disagree with. In the aggregate we have now raised the amount of money individuals can contribute from $25,000 to $30,000 a year. I would not raise individual contributions at all. I think that just intensifies the problem of those people who have the big bucks being able to contribute more. Most people in North Carolina or Kansas or Minnesota cannot afford to contribute $100 a year much less collectively $30,000 a year. 
But we are now down to, as I said, an extra mild version. It doesn't have enough zing in it, from my point of view. But I understand it would represent a step forward if we keep it intact. Part of that deals with the unregulated money, the soft money, that goes to parties. I think it is terribly important to prohibit that because obscene amounts of money have been spent. We really saw that in the Presidential election. It essentially has become such a loophole that it has made people utterly disgusted with the system. A lot of what people have read about and heard about on TV has to do with soft money. 
There's a second part which my colleague was talking about, independent expenditures. It's the issue advocacy ads, which are terribly important to talk about because this is a huge loophole. If this gets stripped out of this piece of legislation, we will be making a huge mistake. I don't need to tell the people in Minnesota who followed the last election because there was about a million dollars spent on issue ads. They essentially run these ads on television and they bash you if you are a Democrat or a Republican--it depends who is doing it. They just don't say vote against you. There is no spending limits at all. So a huge 
problem, again, is with the unregulated money, which can be the soft money, which means that people can be contributing huge amounts of money to this, obscene amounts, which is used to buy elections. 
What this piece of legislation says is you can't do those ads. It becomes express advocacy if you do it in a 60-day period prior to the election and you use the name of the candidate. This is the bright-line test, which makes a whole lot of sense. You can't have perfection here. But if you drop that provision--and I know a lot of colleagues want to drop that provision--then what you will do is stop the soft money to the parties; it is just like Jello, you push in and it will all shift over to these issue advocacy ads. You will have all sorts of groups and organizations, and some you might like and some the Chair might like, some the Senator from North Carolina might like, some I would not like, but that is beside the point. You are going to have the same unregulated, obscene amount of money, no accountability, being spent in these elections, adding to the disillusionment of the people and used, by the way, for these attack ads, where they have been raising millions of dollars figuring out how to rip their opponent to shreds or how to prevent themselves from being ripped up into shreds. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent like this, and it does not add one bit of information for one citizen in the United States. No wonder people hate this system. We ought to really try to build a little bit more accountability into this. 
Well, Mr. President, these are important provisions that we are talking about here. I think that this represents a huge step forward. Mr. President, what I would worry about--and I will sort of finish up this way--is these three scenarios, and when we get into the debate, I can go into all of them in more specifics. One scenario is that we have the majority leader's amendment. It really is, as my colleague said, extraneous to this legislation. We can have a separate debate on it later on. It is really essentially a union gag, worker gag amendment. It is harsh. It should not be on this bill. If it passes--and I think we can have the votes to defeat it--then we reach a huge impasse. I suppose that people can think we have a clever strategy here. But most people in the country know this is nothing more than an effort to waylay the whole reform effort. It won't work. We are only a vote or two away from defeating it. I think we can have Republicans and Democrats join together to do that. 
The second scenario I worry about as well, which is an already stripped-down version of McCain-Feingold, you will have the 60-day accountability on the issue ads taken out. You will raise campaign contributions and you will wind up with a piece of legislation that will have a fine-sounding acronym, that made-for-Congress look, but as a matter of fact, it will just shift the amount of money, spent in a different way. It will be an obscene amount of money. It will still undercut democracy. You will still have all of this money spent, and when people in the country find out that not much really has changed, they will be furious, discouraged, disengaged, and none of us benefit. I hope that doesn't happen. 
The third thing that could happen is that the McCain-Feingold, what I called extra mild, the new formulation, will pass. Again, there is not enough zing in it, from my point of view, but I think it would represent a step forward. I mean, the provisions in the McCain-Feingold extra mild would be a step forward. It would be a reform effort. It would build some more accountability into the system. It would lessen some of the money that was spent, and I think it would give people some confidence that we are serious in this Congress about trying to change this system, this mix of money and politics, which so severely undercuts democracy. 
Now, a final point, if I have 2 minutes left. There is a whole lot of energy around the country at the State level. I mean, Vermont just passed a clean money election option. Maine passed it. I know that Massachusetts is going to deal with this question. This is an effort that I love. I have introduced a bill with Senators Kerry, Biden, and Glenn which basically says we are going to get all of the private money out, the big dollars out, and I think ultimately this is the direction we have to go in. I will tell you something. People around the country at the State level are saying yes to that. 
So, colleagues, people are serious about reform. This is one of those moments in time. As the Senator from Minnesota, I am very discouraged that we are not out here debating this. Let's finish this appropriations bill that my colleagues from North Carolina and California are managing, the D.C. appropriations bill, and let's have the debate on campaign finance reform. Let's not have amendments out here that are nothing less than an effort to destroy this reform effort. Let's debate the stripped-down McCain-Feingold measure and get on and pass the reform bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. The relocation provisions contained in section 115 state that residents shall be relocated to areas that are generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced person's dwelling. Is it your understanding that a comparably desirable area would be one that is not subject to unreasonable adverse environment conditions, and one which offers similar access to public utilities, facilities, services, and the displaced person's place of employment?

Mr. WELLSTONE. That will be fine. 
Mr. President, I first of all want to start out with some praise for my colleague, Senator Coats, from Indiana and for that matter, Senator Lieberman. I think they speak with a great deal of conviction and eloquence on this matter. I think both of them are very committed to the idea of equal opportunity for every child in America. There is no question about that in my mind. 
Mr. President, I too think that there has to be a way that we reinvigorate or renew our national vow of equal opportunity for every child. And I think that education is key to that. 
But, Mr. President, let me just say at the beginning that there are a whole lot of things that we can and should be doing that we are not doing if we are serious about it. And that is sort of the context that I look at this proposal for the District of Columbia, which I will get to in a few minutes. But let me start out, if you will, with a kind of nationwide focus. 
First of all, Mr. President, I have been traveling the country and I have been spending time in communities where people are struggling economically. I spent time with quite a few poor people around our country. 
I am struck by the fact--and I have said this on the floor of the Senate before--that in all too many cases you walk into schools and the ceilings are caving in and the toilets do not work, the buildings are dilapidated, the lab facilities are not up to par, there are not enough textbooks. And with all due respect, quite frankly, until we make the investment in this area, just in infrastructure so schools are inviting places for children, we are not doing that much for kids. 
A voucher plan, be it a demonstration project in the District of Columbia for $7 million or anything else is just a great leap sideways or backward. 
Mr. President, Senators and Representatives have had the opportunity to put some investment in rebuilding crumbling schools in America, and we voted against it. If we are serious about equal opportunity for every child--my colleague from Connecticut spoke about this with a great deal of eloquence--then we ought to just follow the direction of all of the studies that are coming out about early childhood development. It is not surprising that kids are not doing well in these different tests, in the way in which we measure how children are doing in our schools. 
I try to be in a school every 2 weeks in Minnesota. There are so many children that come to schools that have never been read to. There are so many children that come to school that don't know the alphabet, don't know how to spell their name, don't know colors, shapes, and sizes, and we are doing precious little by way of investing in early childhood development. 
Now, I don't know how in the world my colleagues believe that the children we say we care a great deal about, and they do, are going to do well unless we make a commitment here. The answer to the problem is not a voucher plan. The answer is to make the commitment to early childhood development. 
Deborah Meyer, a great urban educator from New York, said, `We can have a debate about tests, we can have a debate about standards, we can have a debate about how we measure this, but there is no debate about the need for you all to get busy investing in the dilapidated schools.' We tell children we care next to nothing about them when the schools look the way they are. 
The judge's court order in Washington, DC, which dealt with getting the asbestos out of our schools, there could be judges issuing these orders in just about every major city in the United States of America, and we haven't invested the resources in this, and we are now saying that the answer is vouchers? 
Mr. President, if we are going to talk about equal opportunity for every child, maybe we ought to take a look at what happens to children before they go to school and what happens to them when they go home. Some of the cuts we have made in nutrition programs--and we have made rather deep cuts in nutrition programs; we are going to cut the major food safety program, the major safety net, which is the Food Stamp Program, by 20 percent by the year 2002 all in the name of welfare reform. 
Or, Mr. President, the cuts we have made in affordable housing. Has anybody looked at some of the homes, some of the apartments, some of the housing that these young children live in? And we are cutting funding for affordable housing. We have a lot of kids that are living in shacks. We have a lot of kids that are living in rat-infested apartments. We have a lot of children that go cold during the winter. 
My colleagues are trying to make the argument that the voucher plan is the way we are going to make sure that these children do well. We do hardly anything to change the concerns and circumstances of their lives outside of the schools. We do hardly anything by way of early childhood development. We do next to nothing when it comes to rebuilding these crumbling schools. And then we turn around and say what we want to do is have a voucher plan. 
Mr. President, my colleague from Connecticut said that he had been in some schools. I have been in some of the schools. I know Senator Coats has. I don't know anybody that has done more travel around the country than Jonathan Kozol who wrote `Savage Inequalities: Children in America's schools.' 
I read from page 83: `In a country where there is no distinction of class,' written of the United States 130 years ago, `a child is not born to the station of his parents but with an infinite claim to all of the prizes that could be won by thought and labor. It is in conformity with the theory of equality as near as possible to give to every youth an equal state of life. Americans are unwilling that any be deprived in childhood the means of competition.' 
It is hard to read these words today without a sense of irony and sadness, denial. Means of competition is perhaps the single most consistent outcome of the education offered to poor children in the schools of our large cities, and nowhere is this pattern of denial more explicit or more absolute than public schools in New York City. Average expenditures per pupil in the city of New York were under $5,500, and in the suburbs you have funding levels that are above $11,000 a year, and some cases up to $15,000 a year. 
All across the country, too much of the education the children get by way of teacher recruitment and teacher salaries, by way of facilities, by way of teacher training, by way of support services, is dependent on the property tax--huge inequalities--and we think that the voucher plan is the way to deal with this problem? 
My good friend Jonathan Kozol wrote another book called 
`Amazing Grace,' poor children and the conscience of America. It is a difficult book to read. It is devastating. It is about children in New York City in the Bronx. Mr. President, the thesis of the book is that no country that really loved children would ever let any group of children grow up under these conditions. 
Looking at the housing in the neighborhoods, the rat-infested housing, looking at the pollution, looking at the number of children suffering from asthma, looking at the lead content still in the paints in the apartments, looking at families without jobs, without jobs that pay a decent wage, looking at children that are malnourished, looking at a school that doesn't get its fair shake of resources, why don't we make those commitments if we want to make sure that every child has the same chance? The voucher plan nationally and this voucher plan in the District of Columbia is not the answer. It is not a step forward. It is a great leap backward from the kind of commitment we ought to make to children in our country. 
Mr. President, I said to my colleague from Indiana and I meant it sincerely, we don't need to be starting to put public money into private schools. We have some of the best public schools in the world. We have some of the best public schools in the world. Go out to some of our suburbs and look at those schools. They are great schools with great teachers with great facilities. What we should be doing is making all the public schools that good. That is the commitment we ought to make. 
One-third of America's schools, serving 14 million of America's 52 million students, are considered deteriorating, according to the Department of Education. Ten million students don't have access to computers; 50 percent of the teachers have no experience with technology in the classroom; 50,000 teachers enter school annually on emergency basis, without a proper teaching license; and within the next decade, thanks to a retirement in the baby boom, we will need 2 million new teachers, and we are now on the floor of the Senate discussing an amendment that would provide resources to private schools. 
Mr. President, Horace Mann said it best in 1830, 170 years ago:  
Choice is not a new idea . . . the newness is who pays for it. As a nation, we are rightly absorbed with improving education. We cannot do it by isolating its problems, and pretending to leave those problems behind to be dealt with by those least able to solve them. The problems of our public schools lie deep in the American experience--poverty, racism, decades of public apathy, drugs, and growing inability of the family, the church, and the neighborhood to nurture many of our children. These problems--and not the attractively sounding solution of private school choice--need to be addressed. 
Mr. President, that is exactly the argument that I just made. Horace Mann just happens to be someone of quite a bit more stature. He was right in 1830 and the same argument applies today, nearly 170 years later. 
You can't take public funds, you can't take public funds, and my colleague Eleanor Holmes Norton informs me that indeed this $7 million comes out of the D.C. budget, you can't take public funds, precious funds, and funnel them to private schools. You have fewer dollars helping kids in math and science, you have fewer dollars in terms of raising the standards of achievement, you have fewer dollars for teacher training, and you have less prevention of drugs and violence in the schools. This is not the time to be making such a decision. 
Mr. President, I want to also point out that there is a Senator from the District of Columbia, a shadow Senator, Paul Strauss, and it is a shame that he doesn't get a chance to be more directly involved in this debate. He has been by my office a lot. He cares about this. I think this has some problem to do with the whole question of lack of representation. 
I think we ought to remember that people in D.C, and my colleague from Connecticut said it was 1981, but by a ratio of 8 to 1 vote against the voucher initiative. If you want to argue that was a long time ago, take a look at the D.C. Board of Education which unanimously opposes the provision. `Private school vouchers is not where the voters of this city want to put their money,' D.C. School Board member Karen Shook reminds us. `To have Congress impose this on us after we soundly voted against it runs counter to democracy.' 
These are elected members to the school board. They voted unanimously one way, and we come to the floor of the Senate and impose a whole different other view. I thought we were interested in local initiative. I thought we wanted local communities to have more decisionmaking power over their children's lives and what happened in their communities. 
Mr. President, I think that if we are going to be talking about improving education, the answer is right before us. We have great schools in our suburbs. We have some great schools in some of our cities. Make all the public schools that way. Make sure that we have a system of financing of schools so that not one school in America, not one school in America, is dilapidated, not one school in America has a roof that is caving in, not one school in America is ladened with asbestos, not one 
school in America has teachers that have to take money out of their pockets and buy textbooks for their students because there isn't enough resource to do so, not one school in America is a school without heat or without air-conditioning during the hot summers. Let's make that commitment. Let's make the commitment to early childhood development. Let's make the commitment to support services for students. Those are the kind of commitments we make, and then we can have all of the public schools being great schools. The voucher doesn't do that. 
Karen Shook, the vice president of the D.C. Board of Education and former Chair of the D.C. Finance Committee said, `Students in the District of Columbia go to school in 100-year-old buildings that have never been renovated.' Why don't we renovate the buildings? The city has a $600 million need to repair schools, yet it has no capital budget. As for social services for troubled youth, `only one counselor is available for every 400 students' in the D.C. public schools. 
As D.C. parent and PTA leader Alieze Stallworth points out: `The majority of children are going to remain in the public school system. What happens to them?' 
Mr. President, I could go on and on. There are other colleagues who want to speak. But let me be clear about this, take the $7 million, and for $7 million we could establish `Success for All,' a proven research-based reading program for disadvantaged students, for every elementary school in the District of Columbia. Put the $7 million into that. 
We could link 116 public schools in the District of Columbia to improve reform efforts such as New American Schools. Put the $7 million in that. 
We could put in place 140 after-school programs based in public schools to help 14,000 children otherwise home alone after schooldays, after school ends each day. Put the $7 million into that. 
We could provide brandnew textbooks for every elementary and secondary school student in every single the District of Columbia school. Put the $7 million into that. 
We could buy 66,000 new hardcover books for the District of Columbia's public libraries, or we could buy 368 new boilers for D.C. schools and protect all the students who go cold during the winter. Put the $7 million into that. 
I am going to be very clear about it. I will try to end on another note. I think that my colleagues are onto something important. I think this amendment is a huge mistake. I think it actually represents a retreat from living up to our national vow of equal opportunity for every child. I think the focus ought to be on all of our schools and all of our children. We ought to make sure that every school in this country, including the schools in the District of Columbia and a lot of other cities in the country, and rural areas as well, are as good as the very best school in some of our wealthy suburbs that have all the resources and teachers that they can hire and all the teachers they can retain and all of the support services and all of the rest. That is the direction we ought to be going in. 
The voucher plan represents a retreat from that. But I want to say to my colleagues on the floor of the Senate, these Senators, with this amendment, are operating in good faith. They are not operating in bad faith. I probably should not end this way because I am so strongly opposed to the amendment. But I really do want to sort of talk about two points that I think they are making that are important. One of them is that, although, again, the per pupil expenditure in the District of Columbia, as I look at these figures, which has been declining now, is now down to $5,923 for fiscal year 1998, that is not nearly as much as the surrounding suburbs. So I don't think we should go overboard on these figures, given the concerns and circumstances of children's lives and, in many ways, a bigger challenge to educate some of the children in the D.C. school system. Nevertheless, I think it is quite appropriate to say, when are we going to cut through this bureaucracy and when are we going to make sure that these dollars that are out there really connect to the education of children? 
I think what my colleagues are trying to say is that they have grown very impatient, they are getting tired of waiting. I share that impatience. I just would do it a whole different way. I would put a lot more investment than I think they want to in what happens to kids in the early years, investment in good programs for kids when they get out of school in the middle of the day when not such good things happen. I would put a whole lot more investment in teacher training and a whole lot more investment in making sure that the best facilities and resources and the schools are inviting places. That is where I would go. I would figure out ways--and I think the District of Columbia is starting to do it--of really making this bureaucracy accountable. I would not be condemning the public school teachers--and they are not doing that. I get angry because I think some of the harshest critics of the public school teachers could not last 1 hour in the classrooms they condemn. 
I spoke the other night at Howard University. In the audience was a public school teacher, and she said it is really hard to go on. They feel so beaten down from all of the bashing. I think these public school teachers do a marvelous job. I understand my colleagues' impatience. 
Second, I think it is true that some of the private schools, and some of the Catholic schools in particular, in some of our innercity communities are schools where, when children come to school every day, they know they are loved and some very important things are happening. They are doing some things in their schools that we are not doing nearly as well as we should do in some of our public schools. It can't be said that children in our public schools, or in near enough public schools, feel as if every day they are loved and they are supported. There are some important things going on in the Catholic schools. There are important things going on in some of these other schools that I think make a huge difference. 
But, Mr. President, this voucher plan, in the context of what is happening nationally, and even in the context of what is happening in the District of Columbia, however well-intentioned it is, I think does not represent a step forward. I think it represents a great leap backward from equity. It represents a great leap backward from the idea of truly equal opportunity for 
every child, and it represents the beginning of a great leap backward from a commitment to public schools, where all of the schools and all of the children represent the best of America, which is opportunity, which is good education, education that fires up young people, that gives them hope that they can do well in their lives. That is the direction we ought to go. This voucher proposal, in the District of Columbia or anywhere else, doesn't take us in that direction. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for all of the hard work that they have done on S. 830, the FDA Modernization and Improvement Act of 1997. Senator Jeffords has provided his leadership in bringing this legislation forward, and my other colleagues have worked to negotiate agreement on provisions where there was concern. I would like to thank Senator Coats, who was true to his word that he would work with us to come to an agreement on third party issues, and Senator Gregg, who worked to reach a compromise on the national uniformity provision. 
It is my belief that we can provide medical products to consumers in a more timely manner through many of the provisions in this bill, while retaining significant consumer protections. Many of the provisions in S. 830 will take a significant step toward addressing Americans' concerns with the FDA. The legislation would improve the predictability, timeliness and focus of the regulatory process for medical products. The legislation would also improve communication and collaboration between the FDA and the regulated industries. I strongly endorse the view that these objectives can be met and unnecessary regulatory burdens can be minimized without compromising the quality of the reviews. 
My colleagues and I have worked very hard on bringing forward needed reform proposals with respect to the review and approval of medical devices. We have negotiated many of the original provisions in the bill to the point that we have reached agreement on them, and can join together in supporting them. We have taken into consideration the comments and concerns of consumers and industry in order to present a bill that will improve the review and approval processes. 
As you know, I have always been and will continue to be a strong consumer advocate. I think that S. 830 provides many things for consumers and will help to bring them medical therapies that are safe and effective in a more timely fashion. This is especially true with respect to devices. This is the part of the bill on which I have focused the bulk of my attention, and I do think that a large number of concerns that I and some of my colleagues, in particular Senator Kennedy, had have been addressed. 
There has been a great deal of discussion and debate about section 404 of the bill, which deals with labeling for intended use of devices. This issue is highly technical, but it is clear that all of us have the same goals in mind: First, to provide a degree of consistency in the way devices are reviewed by individual reviewers, so that reviewers do not try to second guess an honest manufacturer with respect to the intended use of a device, and second, to prevent the very few companies who might try to avoid presenting the FDA with adequate data about safety and effectiveness from having their devices classified and brought to market under the 510(k) process. I do not believe that the provision in this bill prohibits the FDA from exercising its authority to not find a device substantially equivalent to its predicate device when there are technological differences that raise new issues of safety and effectiveness. But obviously, there are differences of opinion with respect to this provision. Since we all agree on the goals that we are trying to achieve, I think that there must be a way of clarifying the authority of the FDA in a way that is satisfactory to everyone. 
The Reed-Kennedy amendment offered one option, but this option is not the appropriate one. Several other suggestions for language to clarify this have been offered, but none capture what we are all trying to do. Rather than reiterate all of the arguments that were stated in the debate over the past several days, I will ask that my colleagues who are appointed as conferees work together to ensure that this provision is worded to make clear that it will penalize anyone who tries to get around the law, but will not penalize those who are complying with the intent of Congress and the law. 
Madam President, as I have said before, I think this is an important piece of legislation. It is clearly important that we reauthorize and improve PDUFA, and that we work to bring safe and effective medical therapies to the public in a timely manner. Again, I would like to thank my colleagues, especially Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy and their staff members for all of their efforts on this bill. I would also like to thank the consumer groups for their input, and the administration for its assistance in the negotiations process. I trust that the conferees will keep the importance of this bill in mind as they negotiate to bring the final legislation to the floor for passage.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I really am in strong opposition to the amendment of my friend--and he is a friend--from Arkansas. I find it hard to understand why we would be creating additional hurdles, as this amendment does, for communities to work together to restore and protect rivers and riverfronts. I think that is what this debate is all about. We have a President who has initiated a program that will help local communities restore and protect rivers without any additional regulation, and Mr. President, for the life of me, I don't know why we would want to support an amendment that would delay the start of this program, and which I think really would have no obvious benefit for our country. 
Mr. President, while the Congress does have an oversight role--and I acknowledge that--this amendment, I believe, is a misplaced effort to involve all property owners in the designation process, that would really create a whole new cumbersome process and give some form of veto power to a single property owner who might decide to object, for whatever reason. So I think the amendment, however good-intentioned, is mistaken. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that this amendment is about stopping the American Heritage Rivers Program, not protecting property owners from some imagined Federal takeover of their property. The Senate is supposed to be a voice of reason. I think by perpetuating the myth that the Federal Government is somehow engaged in a land grab or a power grab through this program is a dangerous game, and I think it is one we should be very cautious about entering into. 
Let me speak, in the last couple of minutes, about Minnesota. We have some fine rivers in the State of Minnesota and many communities who want to see this program go forward. One of those rivers, I think most of my colleagues are acquainted with, is called the Mississippi River. It flows right past the State of my friend. I don't need to tell my colleagues how important this river is to the Nation, how important it is to our Nation's culture, our history, and our economy. I will tell you that in Minnesota we have mayors from communities such as Bemidji, at the headwaters of the Mississippi and from Minneapolis, St. Paul, South St. Paul, St. Cloud, Anoka, Wabasha, Winona, and others, working with mayors in other States along the Mississippi to develop their nomination for this program. 
So we have a lot of communities seeking designation of the Upper Mississippi River to improve access to Federal riverfront revitalization programs, and who are fully respectful of property rights, like other local governments across America who want to compete in this program. I think that if this amendment was passed, it would place an insurmountable roadblock in front of the aspirations of local communities in the State of Minnesota and across America who are trying to make improvements and make the most of their river resources. Let me repeat that. I think if the amendment passed, the biggest problem is that it will create an insurmountable roadblock for a lot of our local communities who are doing their level best to make improvements and make the most of their river resources. That is the problem. 
I applaud the President's work. I applaud this initiative, this program, and I hope my colleagues will vote against the 
Hutchinson amendment. I will certainly strongly support the Dodd-D'Amato motion to table. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators DeWine, Jeffords, and Kennedy, in introducing the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1997. This bipartisan bill is a major accomplishment for Americans who need Federal assistance to acquire skills to qualify for good jobs. 
The bill also is a major accomplishment for my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, Chairman of the Labor Committee's Employment and Training Subcommitee, whom I commend for bringing us to this point through numerous valuable hearings and a rigorous, cooperative drafting process. A number of Minnesotans testified at our hearings. Groups from Minnesota and from around the country have been consulted and listened to. I thank both Senator DeWine and Senator Jeffords for the openness of the process. As always, I would also like to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Kennedy. His deep experience and commitment have helped make this an excellent bill. 
As leaders for our respective parties on the Subcommittee and on the full Labor Committee, the four of us may not always agree on issues facing America's working families. But we agree on this bill. It will fundamentally improve our Federal system of job training, adult and vocational education, and vocational rehabilitation programs. 
The bill will help coordinate, streamline and decentralize our Federal job training system. It will make that system more accountable to real performance measures. It gives private sector employers--the people who have jobs to offer and who need workers with the right skills--a greater role in directing policy at the State and local level, which is where most decision-making power resides in this bill. And it moves the whole country to where Minnesota has already moved decisively: to a system of one-stop service centers where people can get all the information they need in one location. At these one stops, people then will have the ability to make their own choices, based on the best information, about which profession they want and ought to pursue, about the skills and training they'll need, and about the best place to get those skills and that training. I have visited one-stop centers in Minnesota. They work. 
In addition, and this is very important, our bill achieves the things I have mentioned above without neglecting the need to target resources from the Federal level to those who need them most: to disadvantaged adults and youth, and to dislocated workers. 
That is crucial. This bill does not overreach. It does not block-grant all Federal job training, adult education and vocational education progams to governors. It retains crucial federal priorities, then allows State and local authorities to decide how best to address their needs. That is why I believe this Congress will succeed where we did not during the last Congress. We'll pass this bill, reach an acceptable conference agreement with the House, and send major, important legislation to the President for his signature.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I can only add a little bit to what the Senator from Arkansas has just said. I wish he would not be leaving the Senate. I have told him that a hundred times, but I will say it one more time. 
Mr. President, as a Senator from Minnesota, I rise in support of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. I am troubled we are out here on the floor, again defending the Federal role in really supporting the arts in communities all across our country. Some of my colleagues are arguing that, with their block grant proposals to States, they really support the NEA. This will just get the money to States in a more efficient manner, a more timely manner. But these amendments do nothing more--and I think everybody should be aware of this before they cast their votes--than cut off the lifeblood of the National Endowment for the Arts. That is exactly what these amendments do. I think that is the purpose of these amendments. 
There is a bitter irony to the timing of these amendments, because Jane Alexander has done such an excellent job of reorganizing the endowment. I come to the floor to recognize her fine work and to support the NEA. When Ms. Alexander was confirmed as Chairwoman of the NEA, she made a commitment that she was going to work closely with the Congress, that she would take necessary steps to reorganize the Endowment, and she has done that and, as a matter of fact, I think her effort has been nothing short of heroic. She has, through her leadership, helped form and lead a 
NEA that touches the lives of all citizens, regardless of their age, their race, their disability, their economic status or, I might add, their geographic location. Jane Alexander has been blessed with a lifetime of creativity and accomplishment and she has blessed our country with that creativity. She has done a marvelous job of bringing the arts into our classrooms and into every corner of our Nation. 
Now, again we are out here having to defend the NEA. The budget is pathetically low. We could do much more to fire the imaginations of children all across the country. Yet we have another attack on the NEA, out here on the floor today. 
In my State of Minnesota, the NEA has given support to the American Composers Forum, the Minnesota Alliance for Arts and Education, Gray Wolf Press, the Duluth Superior Symphony, the Rochester Civic Music Guild, as well as the nationally renowned Dale Warren Singers, the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, and the Guthery Theater. 
In addition, because of support from NEA, national theater and dance groups have visited many rural communities all across the State of Minnesota. The NEA has supported some wonderful partnerships in Minnesota, including a partnership between the Minnesota Orchestra Association and the science museum, which has created an interactive work between actors, the full orchestra, and fifth and sixth graders. That is what this is all about. 
One grant we are especially proud of that really goes to Minnesota, but goes to the whole Nation--and one of the most important things about these grants is the way in which a grant can go, in this particular case to the Minneapolis Children's Theater Company--and what they have done is this grant has supported the development and production of a new work which is called the Mark Twain Storybook, which has toured 35 communities in 9 States, from Fergus Falls, MN, to Mabel, MN, to Skokie, IL, offering a total of 73 performances and 5 workshops. 
Sometimes when my colleagues look at funding that goes to particular States, they forget that one of the things the NEA has done under Ms. Alexander's leadership is taking a chance, this particular case on the Minneapolis Children's Theater Company, which is marvelous, and they then take that on the road and reach out to 9 States, 73 performances, 5 workshops. This is enriching work. 
I just would like to make the point that the block grant amendments are not friendly amendments. As I say, they undercut the very heart of what NEA is about, which is national leadership of the arts in our country. We as a national community make a commitment to the arts. We understand how important the arts are to enriching the lives of all of our citizens. We make it one of our priorities--not much of a priority, because we have had attacks on the NEA over the past few years and it is so severely underfunded--but, nevertheless, we as a national community understand that we make a commitment to leverage the funding and to get it to organizations to, in turn, get it to communities all across the country. 
The block grant proposal takes us in the exact opposite direction. I really do believe that the timing of these amendments is just way off. One more time, I just want to repeat for colleagues that regardless of the words that are uttered and regardless of the intentions of colleagues, I think the effect of these block grant amendments is to just cut off the very mission, the very lifeblood, the very richness, the very importance of what the NEA is all about. 
We are only talking about $100 million. It is an agency that has been severely undercut because of attacks of past Congresses. But I will tell you something, people in the country have rallied behind the NEA, I think in large part because of Ms. Alexander's leadership. We have an agency that is bringing the arts into classrooms and bringing arts into the communities all across our country. We have an agency which has done a marvelous job of being in partnership with local communities and States, doing a really superb job.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I think these amendments represent a different kind of attack. We had amendments to just eliminate the NEA. We may have one of those amendments on the floor now, maybe, to eliminate NEA. We have had amendments in the past to severely undercut the funding for NEA. 
I just don't know what will satisfy colleagues. Jane Alexander made a commitment to us that she would be very tough in her management, she would do the necessary reorganization work, she would take all of her creativity and use that creativity to make the NEA an agency that clearly was rooted in communities all across our country. And for Minnesota, for rural America, the east coast, west coast, North and South--that is exactly what has been done. So I hope we will defeat these amendments and we can as a Senate vote for a commitment which is a national community commitment that we care about the arts, that we are committed to enriching the lives of children, all children in this country, and we are committed to making sure the arts reaches out and touches all of our citizens no matter their income, no matter their race, no matter disability, no matter age. That, I think, is what its mission is all about, and I think the NEA under Ms. Alexander's leadership deserves the strong support of the Senate. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we had an extensive discussion on the Nickles amendment last time. I just want to speak for a very brief period of time about it this morning. 
Pending before a Federal court in New York, scheduled to be considered next Friday, is a motion by the election officer of the 1996 Teamsters election. A judge will make a decision then. And the problem with this amendment, Mr. President, is that it essentially tells the judge what to do. 
I would like to say this morning that in many ways this reminds me of yesterday. This is an overreach. I think we are getting a little bit carried away with our power here. 
My colleague from Oklahoma is a fine Senator. But he is not a judge. It is Senator Nickles. It is not `Judge Nickles.' We don't really have the right to tell a judge what kind of decision he should make regarding the 1989 consent decree. That is for the judge to decide next week. 
Mr. President, it is true that we had an election, and it is true that it was not satisfactory. And, indeed, the investment that we made to make sure it was a clean and fair election lead to a report, and the election officer essentially saying there has to be a rerun; that this has to be done again. That is the way it is supposed to be. An election which is not a fair election means that you have to have another election. That is where we are heading. 
Mr. President, my colleague from Oklahoma has said that the consent decree was neutral as to whether there would be any more money spent on the election--silent on that matter. If so, on the Kennedy amendment, what my colleague from Massachusetts has talked about is right on the mark; that we make a commitment that we will not do anything here that will overturn, or essentially contradict, that consent decree. 
The judge makes the decision in New York next week. What are we as a U.S. Senate doing trying to tell that judge how he should decide? That is an overreach. That is not our business. I think it raises constitutional questions. But I also think it raises another set of questions. I said this last time. I will repeat it in the last minute or two that I have. 
Whatever the intentions of my colleague--and I know they are good intentions--the fact of the matter is that there is a whole lot of people in the country who find the timing of the Nickles amendment to be suspect. I mean it comes in a relatively short period of time after a very successful justice struggle by UPS workers and by the Teamsters. It just looks like payback time. That is, I am sure, not his intention. 
But the point of it is the timing is off. It doesn't look good for the U.S. Senate to be coming out on the floor of the Senate with an amendment like this short on the heels of this great victory for working people. And, in addition, it is an overreach. I mean we should not be telling the judge what kind of decision a Federal district judge in New York makes next week. I don't think it is constitutionally the right thing to do. I think it is probably unconstitutional. I don't think it is appropriate, and I hope that there will be a very strong vote against the Nickles amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I congratulate my colleagues. I am going to vote for this, but it is a close call. I have some sympathy for the comments made by the Senator from Missouri. I would like to, in the midst of people feeling good about this work, sound a cautionary note. There are different ways of measuring accountability rather than just standardized tests. If teachers have to use the standardized tests, it will be educationally deadening, and I worry about the worksheets becoming the primary way we are teaching. 
The second point I want to make, I say to my colleagues, is it is true, we have to have standards in accountability, but if we don't do anything to dramatically transform the concerns and circumstances of these children's lives, we already know which children are going to do well on these tests and which children are going to fail. If I had a criticism to level, it would be more at my party and more at the administration. 
The fact of the matter is, we are investing not anything in rebuilding crumbling schools. Where is the President and the administration on this? The fact of the matter is, we are not even reaching 1 million Head Start students. I was out here on the floor yesterday talking about that. The White House did not even ask for enough money to cover 1 million. Why can't we do more by way of Head Start, early childhood development, reinvest and build schools as opposed to having these dilapidated crumbling schools in this country? What did we do when we cut food stamps, which is the major food nutrition program for children, 20 percent by 2002? 
In all due respect, these tests are a small move in the right direction, but they are use just a technical fix and are just symbolic and do not do much until we finally make a commitment to make sure there is equal opportunity for every child in this country. We are a long, long, long way away from that in the U.S. Senate or the U.S. House of Representatives. I call on the President to show much more leadership when we are talking about children and education.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about S. 830, the FDA Modernization Reform Act of 1997. 
I guess there are a couple of things I would like to say about this piece of legislation. 
First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues who have worked very hard on this. Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, Senator Coats, Senator Gregg, Senator Harkin, and many others as well. 
I also would like to thank Linda Degutis, who is going to be on the floor with me who has been a fellow with our office. These fellow programs are wonderful programs. I think many of us are always looking for additional support and expertise. She has done a marvelous job. 
This bill has traveled an interesting journey. It was in committee markup about maybe a year ago, or thereabouts. I voted against it then. That was a difficult vote for me because it never really came to the floor. But I said then that there was much in this bill that I approved. I wanted to see some changes. But I thought the bill went too far. 
It was frustrating because on the medical device part of this bill our office had put much work into it. We spent about a year and a half, and I think other Senators know what this is like--writing a lot of the provisions. But I thought the legislation went too far. 
There were a number of things in it that are technical sounding. I will not go into all of it. But it was an overreach. It went too far trying to privatize FDA. The one thing you don't want to do is throw the baby out with the bathwater. I really have to keep the consumer protection part. It is quite one thing to say that you want more predictability and more timeliness and more focus in the regulatory process. I am all for that. It is one thing to say that we have to get these products to the market in a timely fashion. I am all for that. But they have to be safe and effective. 
Then we came back to committee. The second time around it was close again because there were some provisions in the bill that I did not agree with. I voted for it. I have tried to work real hard with lots of different people here. I don't think I need to talk about myself because that is not important. I think this has been a pretty darned important collaborative effort. 
We are almost there. I thank Senator Gregg for his cooperation. I think the provisions dealing with cosmetics and preemption of State standards, which would have affected my State in a very negative way, was a mistake. I think that has been worked out. We still may have some work to do yet with NEPA in terms of how this affects environmental impact statements. I believe that will be worked out. There are a couple of other problems that I think we are working on right now. 
But, Mr. President, let me just say that it is my belief that we can do better--that we can provide medical products to consumers in a more timely manner through the provisions in this bill while retaining significant consumer protection. It is my belief as a Senator that this legislation would improve the predictability and the timeliness and the focus of the regulatory process for medical products. 
Mr. President, next week when we bring this bill up, I am going to talk about what all of this means in specifics because this has been about 2 1/2 years of work for me as a Senator from Minnesota. But as long as we are just kind of setting the stage here, if you will, I think the mood here in the Senate is very positive. 
I say to Senator Jeffords again, Senator Jeffords has done a really fine job of bringing people together. I actually think that we brought together not only Democrats and Republicans but others, a lot of people who have been involved with this. I will give full credit to a lot of the consumer organizations who have not agreed with everything in the bill, and they have been fighting hard and they continue to fight hard. They certainly have let me know when they have not agreed with positions I have taken, but they have done it with class, and they have been tough. They should be tough, and they should be critical. And they have been. 
By the same token, I want to make it clear that I think the business community, the industry has been very responsible. At one point in time when the Congress first started talking about FDA reform, I think there were some--this now goes back probably 2 years or so--who really looked at this as an opportunity to privatize FDA, roll back the really important consumer protection provisions. 
I think that is over. It is over for a lot of different reasons. It is over because I think people now in the Congress hopefully understand that people in the country are not interested in not having strong consumer protection. They view FDA as extremely important to them and the regulation that FDA does as being very important to their lives and to their children's lives. 
I also think people have pulled back from that because the of industry--and I want to give a lot of credit to the industry. There are a lot of people in the industry--and I know more about the medical device industry--who have basically every step along the way made it clear that, no, this goes too far; we are willing to compete with the gold standard; we are just asking to get our products to the market in a more timely fashion, but we don't want to give any ground. These products have to be safe and effective. 
To say that there ought to be more predictability, to say that when you have a protocol and you have waited for a year or you have waited more than a year and then all of a sudden you are told the protocol is no good, you had a right to learn about that earlier, you would like to at least have conversation with the agency, is very reasonable. 
Now, we had some provisions in the bill, including when I voted for it in the committee, that I thought still needed to be worked on, changes needed to be made. Again, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and a number of people worked very hard and I think we have really worked very diligently, and a lot of those problems I think we have dealt with. 
So what we have here, Mr. President, I think is an important piece of legislation. We will undoubtedly have that, when we bring this bill to the floor--I say to my colleague, Tuesday, probably, is that correct?

Mr. WELLSTONE. There will be discussion. Some of us are still working on improvements. But overall what this piece of legislation does, I will summarize--and I will talk about it in specifics later. I will talk about it in a fairly technical way next week. But if I had to summarize, I do believe now after tough negotiation, after a lot of people in the country being involved with this on all sides, after Democrats and Republicans I think pulled together on this, with Senator Jeffords--and I am not just saying this because he is in the Chamber--really providing key leadership, Senator Kennedy being in there fighting, with Senator Coats as well, being willing to negotiate; I am proud of our office's roll and other people as well, what we have is a piece of legislation which says essentially, look, there will be more predictability, there will be more timeliness, more focus on FDA's regulatory action, we can get products to the market in a timely fashion, which is important to families and consumers, but we can do it in such a way that we do not sacrifice consumer protection. 
We are almost there, and I think this is going to be a very important reform bill, and I am very proud to be a part of it. 
I thank my colleague for his work.

We have continued to be in tough negotiations and a good number of these problems have been resolved. I guess my style would be to say to the strong consumer organizations, keep on pushing hard to the very end. I think this is emerging as a real solid piece of work, and I am proud to be a part of it.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise today on the floor of the Senate to express my strongest opposition to an amendment which I am sure has been offered in good faith but the effect of which really will be to intimidate advocates of public health and, in particular, I think amounts to an intimidation of the attorney general of the State of Minnesota and, again, the public health community who have hired legal advocates on their behalf and on the behalf, I might add, of the collective public health people in this country. 
Mr. President, let me give a little bit of information about Minnesota's tobacco case, because this amendment does not have a neutral effect. My colleague, Senator Durbin from Illinois, last night pointed this out. In a State like Minnesota we have pored through 36 million pages, 36 million documents, in what promises to be the biggest court case this winter. This will bring to light a tremendous amount of information in all likelihood, I think, dealing with some very serious abuses by the tobacco industry, which could lead to a very far-reaching and major financial settlement for Minnesota and also lead the way for other States. It also could lead the way toward some really dramatic protection for people in this country. This amendment amounts to nothing less than an effort to intimidate advocates of public health and to intimidate the attorney general of the State of Minnesota. 
The $250 per hour or $5 million cap altogether does not take into account, as my colleague from Illinois mentioned last night, different efforts that have taken place in different States. But to me, again, regardless of the motivation, the effect of this amendment is a get Minnesota amendment and, I might add, it really goes after, again, most importantly, advocates of public health. 
I have no idea--I am not a lawyer--what the particular arrangements are between the attorney general and the contract with lawyers who are working with our State, but I doubt very seriously that we, the U.S. Senate, have the constitutional right to directly intervene in that. I do know this amounts to nothing less than an effort to get people to back down. I don't think that will happen, I say to my colleagues, not in Minnesota. 
Let me say a little bit about Minnesota's tobacco case. Minnesota is the first State in the Nation to charge the tobacco industry with consumer fraud and antitrust violations and the second State to seek Medicaid reimbursement. 
It is the only State with a private co-plaintiff, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota. 
Minnesota's outside counsel, Robins, Kaplan, Miller, & Ciresi, has a national reputation for resolving complex litigation battles against corporate giants, including the Dalkon shield case and the Bhopal, India, chemical spill case. 
This case was launched in August 1994. There are 36 million documents. The State has won the majority of pretrial motions and all appeals, including one in the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The State has secured 30 million pages of documents through discovery. Minnesota has the largest collection of tobacco documents in the world, housed in two secured depositories in Minneapolis and London. 
Public documents already cited as evidence in the case have detailed youth marketing, enhancement of the effect of nicotine, admissions of health problems, and other disclosures central to Minnesota's allegations. Most of the evidence remains under seal at the tobacco industry's insistence. 
The court is reviewing tobacco companies' most secret documents, formerly hidden under attorney-client privilege claims, for possible disclosure. That is the current status. 
The Minnesota case is rated by top tobacco stock analysts at Bernstein Research as `the biggest threat' to the industry. 
The trial begins January 1998. 
I think that is what this is all about, at least in its effect. Minnesota's court case is the biggest threat to the industry. We will see a disclosure of information that will be so critical to the health of people all across the country. This amendment amounts to an effort at intimidation toward the advocates of public health who have hired lawyers as their advocates and, again, I think is really aimed right at the State of Minnesota, really aimed right at the attorney general of Minnesota. 
This is a tobacco industry amendment. This industry doesn't want a State like Minnesota to go forward. This industry doesn't want lawyers out there representing the public health community. Let's be realistic about it. The only way you can go through all these documents, the only way you can put together this kind of case, the only way you can go after these tobacco companies, these giants, is by having lawyers working for you. That is what the State of Minnesota has done. That is what the public health community has done. This amendment is an amendment aimed at trying to bring a halt to this process. 
Mr. President, I am not, again, an attorney, but I will raise two or three final points. One, I don't really know how we in the Senate can say to the attorney general of Minnesota or the State of Minnesota, whatever your contractual arrangements are--and I don't even know what they are with lawyers representing your State--we're going to come in and essentially declare that null and void; we're going to supersede that contractual arrangement. I don't even know if we can do that. 
No. 2, I will just tell you that when you are talking about 30 million pages of documents through discovery, this cap is not neutral in its effect on a State like Minnesota, and $5 million compared to what Minnesota might very well be able to accomplish by way of a damage suit, by way of compensation for the people of Minnesota, by way of information for the public, by way of what information comes to those of us in the Congress, by way of what we can do with that information to protect the public health really amounts to hardly anything. 
Finally, Mr. President, there is a world of difference between $5 million and the amount ultimately that that kind of legal counsel on behalf of the public health community will be able to obtain, again, by way of financial compensation and by way of information and by way of protection for the public health, all of which has to do with research and protection of people's health in this country. 
So let us just be real clear about this amendment. This is the tobacco company's dream amendment. That is what this is all about. And that is what this vote is all about. I think my colleagues will be making a big mistake if they do not think that people cannot see through this. 
Just a little bit of chronology here so that people in the country understand this debate right now. And I think they do already. My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, joined by Senator Collins, Republican from Maine, in a bipartisan effort, came to the floor of the Senate--let us just be sort of historical about this for a moment--and said, wait a minute, we had this tax package, and we had this budget bill, and that is what it was supposed to be all about. And lo and behold, somebody slipped in a $50 billion relief package for the tobacco companies that they could use as credit toward any final compensation that they owed to people in this country. 
My colleague from Illinois was very polite. I will be just as polite because I do not really know who did it. He said that the tobacco industry's lobbyists put this in the bill. They did not actually, literally do that. Senators and Representatives did that. Actually, the tobacco companies' lobbyists are very powerful, obviously. We see it again with this amendment. But they are not actually so powerful, as the Chair knows, that they can actually directly write the amendment, literally be the ones who put the amendment in in the conference committee. They cannot actually do that. They cannot actually sit there and pretend like they are Senators and Representatives. Actually some Senator or Representative has to do that.

Mr. WELLSTONE. That is my understanding. 
If I could go on--I think I have the floor--I was going to say to my colleague, it is my understanding also that the tobacco industry challenged that and that they lost in court. 
Then in response to the second question, actually what my colleague from Illinois said was what I was going to say as well. Again, I am not a lawyer, but it is pretty clear to me that it is fine to get the compensation for the copying or whatever needs to be done with all the documents, but somebody has go through those documents, somebody has to read the documents, and somebody has to try to determine what those documents really are saying in terms of culpability, in terms of what might have happened. That is, of course, the work that the lawyers are doing on behalf of the public health community. 
But, Mr. President, since there isn't a third question, let me go back because there are other colleagues on the floor. And 
I will be pleased to----

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond to the third question. Then I will just finish up. But the first question actually raised by my colleague from Alabama raises an interesting question. 
In response to the third question, I say to my colleague from Alabama, I very much appreciate what he said. That is why I was very careful in the beginning saying--I learned a long time ago to assume good faith on the part of other colleagues, to basically assume people are doing what they think is right. I would not suggest that my colleague is a pawn of anybody. 
What I said was that the amendment, whatever the intention, has the effect, will have the effect, of intimidation of the public health community and will have the effect of and amounts to an effort in terms of its effect to intimidate the attorney general in Minnesota and the State of Minnesota. That is exactly true, and in that respect, it is a tobacco company amendment. 
Mr. President, actually--to go back to Minnesota--I find it interesting that what happened apparently is Minnesota went to a contingency fee, and then as a result of that, the tobacco companies challenged this in court. So now we have an amendment on the floor which is another way of essentially trying to deal with this arrangement in Minnesota. I do not think we in the U.S. Senate should be doing this as it affects different States. 
Mr. President, just a little bit of history to bring us to where we are right now. 
So what happened is that unnamed colleagues--I mean, it was not the tobacco industry; they did not actually sit down in the committee and put the amendment in--somebody tucked the amendment in. Old politics, back room politics, you know, it just happens in the dark, just happens behind the scenes. I mean, once upon a time people viewed that as being clever legislators. It just does not work that way any longer. 
So my colleagues come to the floor, and they essentially say, `Look, let's just at least knock that out. That ought not be in there.' That is what this amendment is about. That would be a proposition that we could have an up-or-down vote on. 
When I was back in Minnesota and the stories broke that in the tax bill we had this $50 billion tax break, tax credit, tax giveaway to the tobacco industry, people in Minnesota were saying to me, `Congratulations, Paul. You voted against that tax bill. You voted against that budget bill. You knew, and a lot of other people didn't.' And I said to them, `You know, I've got be honest. I voted against that bill for other reasons. I didn't know. I would love to tell you I was the one person who did and that is why I voted against it, but actually I didn't know.' 
This was just sort of tucked in there. Some Senators, Representatives--one, two; I do not know how many--put it in there. It was very cleverly done. But my colleagues have come to the floor and said, `Look, we didn't know that was in there. This is not the way it's supposed to work. This is not exactly a political process with a lot of accountability. We ought to take it out. We can have an up-or-down vote on that.' 
Now what we have is an amendment with the intended effect to intimidate advocates of public health. I mean, that is not the motivation, but that would be the effect of it. I do not know that it is an intended effect. It probably isn't. But the effect of it would be to intimidate advocates of public health, to intimidate States like Minnesota where we have plowed through, again, 30 million pages of documents. The Minnesota case is rated by top tobacco stock analysts at Bernstein Research as `the biggest threat' to the industry. And I can see exactly what is going on here. 
This is an amendment that is a dream come true for the tobacco industry to try to go after States like Minnesota, to try to make sure that States cannot go through with this. If that is what happens, then we all lose. 
So, Mr. President, let me just make it clear that this amendment, if passed, would have the effect of intimidating the public health community, advocates for the public health community, and States like Minnesota that promised to bring to 
light, in what would be a huge court proceeding, information that will be vital to the public health of this country. 
This amendment is not neutral in its effect. This is a tobacco industry amendment. That is what this is all about. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote no. As a Senator from Minnesota, I am proud that the Minnesota case is viewed as the biggest threat to the industry. I am proud that the trial is going to begin in January 1998. I am proud that, I think, a whole lot of information is going to come to light and we are really going to learn much more about what exactly has been going on within this industry and how it has affected our families and how it has affected our children. 
But, Mr. President, this amendment is a get Minnesota amendment. This amendment, with its caps, is an effort to go after Minnesota, to go after advocates for Minnesota, to go after the public health community, to make sure that we do not have lawyers that are working on this and to make sure that `the biggest threat' to the industry court case may never take place. It is an outrageous amendment. I hope colleagues will see it for what it is and it will be voted down resoundingly. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, and colleagues, I shall be brief. 
I, too, thank the majority leader, the minority leader, Senator Sessions, and Senator Durbin for their cooperation. 
Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and straightforward, and in a way the context for this is Minnesota. But it really affects all of our States. 
This amendment just says that nothing in the act may be construed to interfere with, or abrogate, any agreement previously entered into between any State and private attorney with respect to litigation involving tobacco. 
For example, in Minnesota the case is in a State court. 
What are we doing? I am not a lawyer. But what are we doing here in the U.S. Senate telling Minnesota that its contract with lawyers that are working with the State of Minnesota could be declared null and void? What are we doing saying that to the State of Minnesota, or what are we doing saying that to any State? I thought we had a States rights Congress. This goes just in precisely the opposite direction. 
Mr. President, again a little bit of information about Minnesota, so we know what is at stake here. I mean I am out here fighting for my State of Minnesota. But I think this is important to all of our States. 
I cannot believe that my colleagues want to be in a position of arguing against the proposition that we should pass an amendment that tells the State it has to abrogate its contract with attorneys that are representing that State in State court. That is absolutely unbelievable. 
Mr. President, in Minnesota, against some background, is the first State in the Nation to charge the tobacco industry with consumer fraud and antitrust violations. It is the second State calling for Medicaid reimbursement. It is the only State with a private coplaintiff, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota. 
The case was launched in August 1994. We have won the majority of pretrial motions, and all appeals, including the one that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Minnesota secured 30 million pages of documents through discovery. Minnesota has the largest collection ever of tobacco documents in the world, housed in two secured depositories in Minneapolis and London. 
The Minnesota case is rated by the top tobacco stock analysts of Burnstein Research as the `biggest threat to the industry.' 
I want to talk about what that means--`biggest threat to the industry.' 
We go to trial in January. This trial stands to be important not just for Minnesota but for the whole Nation--not just in terms of financial compensation for my State, for the people in my State, but the discovery, the information that will come to light about past abuses, about what the tobacco industry has known, about marketing techniques, and all of the rest. 
This amendment, which is an amendment albeit for my State of Minnesota but really applies to every single State, just says to colleagues that in whatever action we take let us be clear that nothing that we are doing here can be construed to interfere with or abrogate any agreement previously entered into between any State and private attorney or attorneys with respect to litigation involving tobacco. 
We have a case in Minnesota. It is in State court. What are we doing in the Congress telling Minnesota that it will have to abrogate its contract with attorneys? The arrangement is made with attorneys so those attorneys can represent the public health community, so those attorneys can represent the State of Minnesota and people in Minnesota, so those attorneys can represent all of us who would like to see these documents and this information come to light. I do not think this is constitutional and I certainly think it is inappropriate.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-18-19970910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, it is certainly not true that very little legal work has been done in Minnesota. The tobacco industry has already spent $125 million defending the Minnesota case alone--$125 million. 
Mr. President, it takes a whole lot of resources to uncover a massive, decades-old coverup of fraud and conspiracy. The Sessions amendment that my amendment speaks to is an attempt to shut down the discovery process, to perpetuate a coverup and to keep secret documents concealed for a long time. The effect of this amendment, unless the second-degree amendment passes, is to punish States like Minnesota and Texas and Massachusetts and Connecticut and Washington and others that have invested heavily in exposing the coverup and bringing the industry to justice. 
I do not know all the specifics of the arrangement between the State of Minnesota or Connectict or Massachusetts or any other State and attorneys that are working for the States and for, I might add, the public health community. Without this work, we would not have been able to bring these documents forward. There will not be the discovery. There will not be the information. There will not be the information to people in this country about a whole pattern of abuse. 
But what I do know, one more time, colleagues, is this is in State court. This is an agreement between my State of Minnesota and attorneys. What in the world are we doing interfering and essentially saying to the State of Minnesota you have to abrogate your contract with your attorneys? Whatever you have decided upon, whatever you do in State court, State court is null and void. My State is not a party to this global agreement here in Washington. Attorney General Humphrey has made it very clear that we are going forward. This is an agreement in a State. This is an agreement between a State and attorneys. This is an effort to deal with a very long, unfortunately protracted, period of time of coverup by an industry. This is an effort that takes on a tobacco industry that spent $125 million on this case alone with lawyers defending it. And you are going to vote against an amendment that says `nothing in this act may be construed to interfere with or abrogate any agreement previously entered into between any State and private attorney or attorneys with respect to litigation involving tobacco'? 
I do not know how colleagues can vote against that proposition. Have whatever views you want, but we do not have any business telling the State of Minnesota that in its best judgment and its best effort, and, indeed, what is being called `the biggest threat to the industry,' it has no right to enter into an arrangement with lawyers and to represent the people in Minnesota and represent the people in the country. And we in the U.S. Senate are going to try to vote against the proposition where we go on record saying we are certainly not going to tell a State it has to tear up its contract? 
Minnesota gets to decide that. Massachusetts gets to decide that. Connecticut gets to decide that. Illinois gets to decide that. Kansas gets to decide that. The U.S. Senate doesn't decide that. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

One more time I will say to colleagues, given this ambiguity, we can argue about it over and over again. This amendment is not ambiguous. It just simply says that nothing that we do may be construed to interfere with or abrogate any agreement previously entered into. 
What are we doing, telling the State of Minnesota, which is a State court, whatever you had to do to get lawyers to represent your State and the people of Minnesota and the people in the country, we are now going to pass something that will tear that agreement up--we have no business doing that. I don't think it's constitutional and I certainly don't think it's right. So I'm out here fighting for Minnesota, but for other States as well.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Senator Murray. This has been a labor of love, working with her on this, from the very beginning. I do think it is very, very important. We have had voice votes on this, but we now need to get the Senate on record, and this is an extremely important amendment. 
It is interesting; this amendment essentially says--and I know Senator Murray and I are so pleased that Senator Landrieu has also joined us--to States, look, Arkansas, Minnesota, if you decide what you want to do is request a good-faith waiver, 
not a total exemption, so that you can as a State such as Minnesota in dealing with a family, a woman who has been battered, has been beaten up over and over again and also dealing with her children, say, look, from the point of view of our work force participation requirements of the welfare bill or ultimately from the point of view of how many people there are going to be in terms of what percentage of people have to be off the rolls, we may need a little more time to give support to these families. We may need a little bit more time. One size does not fit all. 
I would like to thank my wife, Sheila. I said to Senator Murray, she has worked so hard on this. I would like to thank her and also the community in Minnesota that has provided us with a lot of support. The fact is when you meet with families, you realize that all too often a woman has been battered over and over again, her children have seen it, and it just may be that she is not able right away to move into a job. 
I just want to thank Jody Raphael at the Taylor Institute in Chicago, who does rather magnificent work. I would also like to thank Pat Reuss, of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, who has been great. 
Jody pointed out--I am not going to quibble on statistics --in some of her work that a real high percentage, maybe 20 percent or more, of these mothers, welfare mothers who have in fact been beaten, are, in fact, if you will, victims of abuse in their homes. This also affects the children who see it. 
So the reason for this amendment is we just want to make crystal clear to our States, all of our States, that they do have clear direction and support from the Federal Government, from the Congress and the White House and Health and Human Services, that Minnesota, Washington, if you want to provide additional support services and you want to make sure that a woman gets those support services, you can ask for a good-faith waiver to make sure you can do that. 
Otherwise--and colleagues need to understand this, and that is why Senator Murray and I come back to the floor again--we are talking about a very dangerous situation. We talk in this Chamber, the words are spoken and we mean it, but sometimes we forget the connection to people's lives. 
If you do not do this, what is going to happen to all too many women is they are going to be in a situation where they are going to be forced into a work situation. They are not able to do it. They are stalked by a former boyfriend or former husband or whatever the case is. They have been beaten up and maybe they can't even come that day for job training. Maybe physically they cannot come. Maybe they are just ashamed to show up. All of a sudden, because women cannot work, given what is going on, given what is happening to them, given what their children are seeing, we are going to say to these women, `You are off of any AFDC assistance. You do not get any assistance at all.' 
Then what happens, colleagues, is they have one choice for their children. They have to go back into that very dangerous home. They have to go back and be with that batterer. 
Now, Mr. President, the shame of it is--and this is why we come to the floor--the Senate has gone on record, what, three times, I ask the Senator, and then every time--I have heard Senator Murray speak about this eloquently so I do not need to repeat her words--and then every single time in conference this just gets knocked out. That is really outrageous. That is really outrageous. 
It is time that we pass this with a strong recorded vote, and this should be a message to the Congress and a message to the White House and a message to Health and Human Services: Please, get the directive out to the States making it clear to States--right now we have, what, I ask the Senator, 26 States?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Twenty-seven States that have been able to go forward. But even Minnesota, which has gone forward, on the basis of talking to the Senator and Sheila, they have still gone ahead with clear direction. They know the amendment has been passed. They know what it is they are supposed to be doing, but they have not really seen it in writing from the White House, from Health and Human Services. We need that to happen. This is what this amendment is all about. 
I conclude by thanking my colleague, Senator Murray. I think it is extremely important that not only women and not only their children, but there are a lot of men who care about this issue in the State of Washington, Arkansas, and all across the country--I think it is very important that people in our country realize you need a strong voice on this issue. 
Senator Murray has been that kind of Senator. I really would like to thank her for all of her leadership and, for that matter, for just her tenaciousness in coming back over and over and over again and not letting up on this, because this is about people's lives, it is about a lot of women who have had to deal with something that we hope and pray none of our daughters and none of our sisters ever have to deal with. We ought to make sure that we provide them with the assistance they need. 
I will tell you, as a Senator from Minnesota, a State which has done a lot of good work in trying to provide support for women and children, and as the husband of my wife, Sheila, who cares so much about this, I am honored to be in this struggle with Senator Murray, and I know we will prevail with a strong vote. 
I yield back the rest of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment would add $525 million to the budget for Head Start. I thank my colleagues, Senator Harkin and Senator Specter, for their fine work. This bill already provides Head Start with a $324 million increase in funding for 1997. The President, the Clinton administration, claims this will allow Head Start to serve 1 million students by the year 2002. 
The Head Start Association has said rather loudly and clearly that, in order for Head Start to actually serve 1 million students by the year 2002, it would need another $525 million this year and every year until 2002. Therefore, I offer this amendment to increase Head Start's funding by an additional $525 million to reach that goal of 1 million. We ought not say we will reach that goal unless we make the commitment. 
In order to reach this goal, the offset that I propose would be by a rescission from this year's appropriation for the Department of Defense. I could talk about a whole lot of different waste in the defense bill, but just to give but one example, the B-2 bomber most recently has been reported to be unable to fly in the rain and the snow by the General Accounting Office. It, itself, is slated to receive $586 million from the Senate, and $928 million from the House. Though this amendment is not about the debate on the B-2, I understand the Senate has basically said no more B-2's; I think on the House side they have talked about moving forward. 
The Head Start Program currently serves 740,000 students. Head Start, roughly speaking, serves 30 percent of the eligible population of 4- to 5-year-olds; and only 18 percent, if we were going to talk about right after birth until age 5. That means Head Start does not have the money to serve more than 2 million eligible 4- and 5-year-olds and roughly 4 million children from right after birth to age 5. There is no way that this amendment does enough, but it would make a difference. In my State of Minnesota, the money for Head Start covers 9,000 Minnesota children who are eligible out of a population of, roughly speaking, 25 million children. 
I want to be clear about this. I know I will be up against a point of order and I do not expect to win on this amendment. This amendment says that there is still plenty of waste in the Pentagon budget--the B-2 bomber is one good example. On the House side it barely passed any increased funding, a plane that cannot fly in the snow or in the rain, but there are other examples as well. I am just saying, when we look at hundreds of billions of dollars for the Pentagon, couldn't we transfer $525 million to make sure we reach our goal of covering 1 million children? 
But there are two parts to this amendment. The first part is, if we are going to say White House, or we are going to say U.S. Senate, that we are going to make sure that 1 million children are covered, let's not make it symbolic. 
Let's do what the Head Start Association itself says we have to do to make sure we at least cover 1 million children. That is what this amendment says. 
Mr. President, let me go on and say one more time that Head Start altogether leaves out 4 million children-plus who could receive a head start. 
Just to focus on what this amendment is about, there are plenty of people who have said there is more than enough waste in the Pentagon budget--administrative waste, going forward with some weapons systems that make no sense whatsoever--but I hardly hear anybody on the floor of the U.S. Senate say that we should make a commitment to Head Start, which is just about that, giving children from families with really difficult circumstances a head start. 
But we are not even going to reach our goal of 1 million children unless we provide this additional $525 million. We can do better, I say to my colleagues. We can do better for children in this country. We can do better for poor children in this country. 
The scandal to all this is that we are not even coming close to covering 30 percent of the overall population that is eligible. On the one hand, we say we are committed to small children. On the one hand, we have all of this research that is coming out about the development of the brain, talking about how the early years are most critical--right after birth to age 3, actually before birth, that a woman expecting a child should get good care. But at the same time, when you look at just not the 4 and 5 year olds, but when you look at early Head Start, which is right after birth to age 3, we are covering just a small, tiny fraction of the children who could really benefit from this help. What my amendment does is try to appeal to the goodness of the Senate and try and say that we can do better. 
Mr. President, I have been honored as a U.S. Senator from Minnesota to have the opportunity to travel in the country and to be in communities where people are really struggling against some pretty difficult odds, I will just tell you, whether it be in Chicago, in a heavily Latino neighborhood on the south side of Chicago and visit with the Head Start Program and you see these beautiful programs and you meet with the staff. 
Mr. President, the men and women who are the Head Start teachers and teachers' assistants barely make above poverty wages, but you see the good work they are doing and you see all the ways in which children in Head Start receive some intellectual stimulation, they get referred to health care clinics so that they can get the health care that they need, so that they can get the dental care that they need. You see the way in which these programs, at their best, give children encouragement. It breaks my heart that we cover such a tiny percentage of children who could really use this help. 
This really can make a huge difference in young children's lives. I have gone to east Kentucky and have spent time in Appalachia and, again, I met, first of all, mainly women who are Head Start teachers. They should be heroines. I asked a woman who has been with Head Start from the beginning, `Why do you do this? You certainly don't make much money.' 
She said, `I do this because I know what I can do for children. I get so much satisfaction from giving these children this encouragement, from making sure I can help these children at a very young age.' 
We know that. We say we are committed to early childhood development. We say we are committed to covering. We say we are committed to covering that. The administration says we have to make sure 1 million children are covered. We don't have enough funding. The Head Start Association tells us we don't have enough funding for actually 1 million students by the year 2002--1 million children--which is just a tiny percentage of the number of children who are eligible. 
Mr. President, my amendment is pretty simple and straightforward. It says let's live up to our words. We have more than enough waste in the Pentagon budget. We ought to be able to transfer $525 million to make sure we live up to our word and/or contract with these children and at least 1 million children by 2002 receive this Head Start assistance. 
I don't know whether or not we are or are not going to have a discussion about the testing and whether or not the Federal Government or an independent group develops tests, but I want to speak about that for a moment because I think it is directly related. 
I want to say two things by way of conclusion. I say to my colleagues, I don't expect to win. I don't expect to get a huge vote because this is a transfer amendment, and I have seen what happens to transfer amendments from the Pentagon to these kinds of needs. But you can travel in this country, go to Chicago, or go to Minnesota, or go to delta Mississippi or go to Kentucky and meet with children and meet with families and see the good work that is being done by people who should be famous and then see how little they have to work with and how, if we would just invest a little more and not come to the floor and fight, more of these children would have a head start. So win or lose, I am going to speak out on this, and I am going to fight for it. 
Mr. President, I also want to say to the President, to the White House and to the administration, I have been thinking long and hard, if we actually have a vote on this in the Senate, about this whole question of testing. I just want to say that I have a certain amount of sympathy, as someone who was a teacher for 20 years, with those who kind of wonder about the standardized tests. Yes, we want accountability and, yes, it is voluntary. 
I will tell you, I have a real concern about the focus on tests as the way we measure accountability when I think that what it could very well lead to is standardized teaching to standardized tests, worksheets which are educationally deadening. 
I will tell you, in Minnesota, every year I read very carefully the profiles of the teachers of the year. Not a one uses those worksheets. They get kids or young people to connect themselves personally to what is being discussed in the classroom. 
I really worry about the direction we are heading in the name of reform. I also have quite a bit of sympathy with those who are saying to the White House and the administration, in all due respect, if you are going to talk about education and you find that people in the country are with you, if you are going to talk about each and every child should have the same opportunity to reach his or her full potential and people in the country are with you, and if you are going to talk about the need for us as a country to renew and reinvigorate our vow of equal opportunity for every child and you see that the people 
in the country are with you, well, then, do you know what? Make a commitment to do something about it. 
In all due respect, just to have some more tests doesn't do a whole lot. If you don't change the concerns and circumstances of children's lives, starting with more of a commitment to Head Start, then we already know who is going to fail those tests. We have a huge learning gap in this country. We know the children who are going to do well, and we know the children who are not going to do well. What good is it to just fail those children again this time on a test? 
If we don't make sure there is a commitment to Head Start and good child care so that children come to kindergarten ready to learn, and if we don't make a commitment to make sure these schools are inviting places for our children as opposed to being so dilapidated and dreary, investment in school infrastructure, of which we have done hardly anything, and if we don't make a commitment to making sure that these children have hope and have opportunity and that there is the necessary funding, then these tests don't do anything at l. They don't do anything at all. They amount to little more than a technical fix.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, on the other hand, I think that I will support this initiative. I have had a chance to talk with Secretary Riley. He is about as gentle a person as there is in Washington, DC. He is so committed to children, and I guess since it is voluntary and we are trying to develop good tests, it can't really hurt a lot. I guess it would represent a very small step forward and, as a college teacher for 20 years, I don't think I am prepared to just sort of say no, thumbs down. 
But I would like to say to the White House, I would like to say to the President and I would like to say to my party, the Democratic Party, we are going to have to do much better. We cannot say that a million children are going to be in Head Start and then not appropriate enough money to make sure that happens. 
We can't say that we are committed to equal opportunity for every child and not adequately fund Head Start and not adequately fund good developmental child care. 
We can't say that we are for children doing much better in the schools and not invest hardly anything. We have invested hardly anything in rebuilding crumbling schools all across America. We cannot make that case. 
If we are not willing to do what is necessary by way of changing the concerns and circumstances of children's lives before they go to school and when they go home and to make sure that these schools have the resources to work with and have the support services to work with, then these tests are just going to fail the same children who are already failing, in which case it is just absolutely outrageous. 
This amendment that I have offered isn't going to win. Maybe this is what you call a message amendment. But I am telling you something, just as Fannie Lou Hamer, the great civil rights leader, said, `I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.' I get a little sick and tired of our not following through the words we speak with some investment. Everybody is for the children except when it comes to digging in the pocket and making the necessary investment. It doesn't seem to me to ask too much to say an additional $525 million to go into Head Start so, as the Head Start Association says, we can at least serve 1 million children. 
Madam President, I just want to make one other point, and then I will reserve the remainder of my time. Again, if I do this the wrong way, it is not going to come across well, and maybe a lot of Senators do this already. I am telling you, I have learned so much from traveling to communities around the country, just looking, learning from people who are in these struggles of trying to earn a decent living, trying to raise their children well, people struggling economically, looking at the poverty in this country and meeting women and men who should be heroines and heroes who are doing great work. It just reminds you of what being a U.S. Senator is all about. 
Today on the floor of the Senate, I am hoping, even if I don't win, to at least push this debate forward. I just get a little bit indignant that the sole focus becomes testing, and we don't put the money into early childhood development. We don't make sure children come to kindergarten ready to learn. We don't do much of anything about investing in crumbling schools. We don't do much of anything about the huge disparity in resources that different schools have to work with. We don't do much by way of encouraging the teachers. 
I will tell you something, some of the harshest critics of public schoolteachers couldn't last 1 hour in the classrooms they condemn. I am just asking my colleagues today to vote for a small transfer from the Pentagon budget to Head Start. There is no reason to spend a whole lot of more money on planes that can't fly in the snow or the rain. I think we can spend the money trying to provide help and support for children right here in our own country. 
Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, while I am waiting, just some facts by the National Commission on Children. 
The first 3 years of a child's life are a time of unparalleled development: physical, intellectual, linguistic, social, and emotional. 
I do not need to use a commission. Let me use my expertise as a grandpa. I mean, we know this as parents and grandparents. We know now what all of this scientific evidence tells us, which is, these early years are critical years. You have to get it right for children. In fact, if we don't get it right for children in our country, all these children--they are all God's children--then by age 3 many of them may never be ready for school or never ready for life. 
The fact of the matter is, I am just saying, take $500 million for Head Start and at least make sure we cover 1 million children. If we were to consider not just the 4- to 5-year-olds, but the 3-year-olds and the 2-year-olds and the 1-year-olds, where it is probably even more important they get that additional help and families that additional support--we are covering maybe 15, 18, 20 percent of the overall number of children that need this help. 
I find it very difficult, frankly, to explain, why don't we fully fund the Head Start program? If we are going to argue the Head Start program gives children--special children; all children--a special head start, and we are going to argue we know these are the critical years, then why in the world are we not investing the money? Why are we not matching our rhetoric with the resources? 
Madam President, I will say it one more time, and then I will reserve the balance of my time. It is just on a personal note. I love the work that the men and women and women and men in Head Start are doing. 
Thank you for your work in eastern Kentucky, thank you for your work in Chicago, in Minnesota, thank you for your work in delta Mississippi; and I am sure it would apply to Maine and every other State in the country. 
There is nothing more important you can do, because I just tell you that when I spend time with my 20-month-old grandson, the youngest, Joshua, I can't believe it--I have said on the floor before--every 5 or 10 seconds he is interested in something new. We are not, but these children are. They are experiencing all the unnamed magic of the world that is before them. 
You can take that spark of learning, and you can ignite it. And if you ignite it in our Head Start programs--some of them do that; many of them do that--then you can take a child from any background to a life of creativity and accomplishment, or you can pour cold water on that spark of learning. And we do that to too many children. 
In the State of Minnesota we could do so much more. We cover 9,000 out of 25,000 eligible children in Minnesota--9,000 out of 25,000. 
Madam President, this is unacceptable. This is unacceptable. We cannot keep saying that we are for the children, we cannot keep saying we are for equal opportunity for every child, we cannot keep saying we are for education, Democrats we cannot keep saying we are for expanding opportunities and just focus on testing. We have to do much more. 
Where is the investment to rebuild the crumbling schools all across the country? Where is the investment in Head Start? Where is the investment in early childhood development? Where is the investment in making sure that standards are met and that all of the children that are in our child care, whether they be centers or whether they be family child care or home-based child care, that standards are met and children are safe and children are receiving not custodial but developmental care? Where are the standards? Where are the resources? Where is the commitment? 
I do not know if anybody is going to debate me today on this. My guess is it would be just to table the amendment or a point of order. But I would like to debate colleagues, whether they be Democrats or Republicans, about why it is we can't do better. 
We just had this budget agreement. And everybody said that the budget agreement was so successful in dealing with the budget deficit. What about the spiritual deficit? What about the children deficit? What about the education deficit? What about the community deficit? We have not dealt with any of those deficits. 
I just suggest that if we cannot put a little bit more money, at least into Head Start as a start, then we are not doing as good as we could be doing for children in this Nation. 
Now, I grant you, the children who we are talking about in Head Start, these are children that are low income, these are children whose mothers and fathers do not have much by way of economic resources, and they do not have much by way of economic or political clout, but we ought to do better. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Our States are looking for clear direction from the Congress, from the White House, and from Health and Human Services. 
This amendment is very important. I hope we will have a resounding, strong vote.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both managers of the bill for their fine work on Head Start. But I think we can do better. If we reach the goal the President set forth, and we say that we are for really serving 1 million children, then the Head Start Association says we need an additional $535 million to do that. That would be 1 million children. I might add that if we are talking about the early years, 1 million children is but a tiny percentage of the children that could be served by this program. 
So I think we could do better. This just says let's get it up to what the Head Start Association says they need to make sure that we cover the 1 million children that we say we are committed to covering. This $535 million would come from the Pentagon budget. There is plenty of waste in that budget that we can talk about. 
I hope that this amendment will get a good strong vote.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that we are passing this bill to reauthorize Small Business Administration programs. I commend Senators Bond and Kerry, the chairman and ranking member of the Small Business Committee, respectively, for their work. It is an excellent bill, providing adequate loan-guaranty authorization levels for SBA's two principle credit programs--the 7(a) and the 504 programs. The bill also expands and makes permanent the microloan demonstration program, which is extremely important. All three programs are popular and successful in Minnesota. Our committee held a number of hearings this year to prepare for this reauthorization bill, and as usual we have worked in a productive, bipartisan way. 
Our committee passed a very good bill, highlights of which I will mention momentarily. I would first like to note, however, two items which I am grateful could be included in the managers' amendment. The first is a provision clarifying SBA's policy regarding collateral in the 504 Program. 
The 504 Program is an excellent program. It operates through collaboration between certified development companies (CDCs), private lenders and small business borrowers. 504 loans are for larger projects than SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loans. They generally are for property, plant and equipment purchases. It is the only SBA program with job-creation and economic development as its explicit primary objective. I am proud to point out that Minnesota CDCs made 359 loans worth $122 million last year, tops in the nation for the third or fourth year in a row. 
I appreciate steps that were taken by SBA officials in a recent policy guidance on this matter of collateral. That policy guidance assures certified development companies that collateral is only one factor evaluated in the credit determination of a small business in the program. Furthermore, the guidance establishes that collateral in addition to a subordinate lien position on the property being financed will be required only on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Administrator. 
The provision now included in this bill relating to collateral simply codifies that SBA policy guidance in statute. I thank the bill's managers for including the provision at my request in their amendment. As I mentioned to my colleagues on the committee during our markup of the bill, it is occasionally necessary for Small Business Committee to save SBA from itself when it comes to policy proposals concerning its loan programs. Not too many years ago, SBA wanted to eliminate all subsidy and appropriation for the 7(a) program. We on the committee and in Congress were right in preventing them from doing so. 
Subsidy rate questions in the 504 Program remain somewhat unresolved. The simple fact is that demand for the 504 program has been down significantly this year. It is down even after we discount for the burst of activity last September, just before new fees went into effect, putting many deals that normally would have been done this year into last year's volume. I am pleased to say that the program's subsidy rate, which a witness from Minnesota told our committee earlier 
this year is `out of whack,' is now finally being seriously examined by the Administration despite the existence for some time of evidence that it has been based on methodology or calculations that keep the subsidy rate too high. That matters because it appears that the new fees which we have had to impose on borrowers and lenders, required by the high subsidy rate, suppressed demand for the program, exactly as both the Chairman and I said we feared might happen. 
That is the main reason for the amendment, which would keep collateral for 504 deals valued at market value. That is rather than at liquidation value, as had at one point been suggested by some within the Administration. The amendment does not change current SBA policy. Rather, it prevents a suggested change, which in my view would certainly have led to a further weakening of the 504 loan guaranty program. 
Here is the issue. Under current SBA policy, in a project valued at $1 million, 90 percent of the value of a 504 project can be financed by a CDC and a bank together in the form of loans. The remaining 10 percent is required to be provided as equity by the assisted small business. Loan collateral is limited `generally to the assets being financed.' This allows the program to offer attractive, 90-percent loan-to-value financing. It seems like a good deal, and it is, for borrowers and lenders. 
But it's also a good deal for taxpayers because this program creates jobs with no appropriation. That's why I want to keep that policy working the way it is. If we had allowed the Administration to change that policy, by switching to a `liquidation value' approach for collateral, as had been suggested by some within the Administration, then assisted small business people could have been required to provide up to $300,000 of their own equity as collateral, on top of the $100,000 equity already required. When demand for this program already is being suppressed by high fees brought on by high subsidy rates--whether justified or not--this new blow to the program could have seriously harmed it. The National Association of Development Companies, which represents CDC's around the country, told some of us it felt the program could have been `destroyed.' So I am pleased we could address this concern in the bill. 
The second provision I would like to mention immediately is a matter upon which I am pleased to have collaborated with Senator Abraham. The managers also have included this provision in their amendment. It will allow microloan intermediaries to use up to 25 percent of the grants provided to them by SBA for the provision of technical assistance to provide such technical assistance to prospective borrowers--that is, not only small enterprises which are already borrowers, but to prospective borrowers, as well. I appreciate the inclusion of this provision, which allows needed flexibility on the part of microloan intermediaries. Minnesota has four microlending intermediaries, and staff from those organizations have told me how important it is that they be allowed sometimes to counsel and assist potential entrepreneurs prior to the time they are ready to become an actual borrower. In fact the very purpose of the technical assistance during this period is to allow the businessperson to reach the point in his or her business where credit is needed and he or she might become a borrower in the program. 
The bill reauthorizes most SBA programs for an additional 3 years. The loan guaranty authorization levels are adequate in my judgment. In the case of both the 7(a) and 504 program, they exceed industry requests. The loan authorization level for the microloan program meets the Administration's request, although I had hoped to achieve a higher level for technical assistance grant funding. As I mentioned before, the microloan program nonetheless is expanded and made permanent in this bill, steps which are justified by the program's very beneficial performance. As an original cosponsor of the legislation which first created the program, I am proud that Minnesotans who utilize it are among the nation's leaders. The very small firms which receive very small loans through the microloan program often have a big impact in their communities. 
The bill will allow SBA programs to continue to be among the most popular and effective business programs operated by the federal government. I know they are popular and well used in Minnesota, where I am also proud to point out that we have one of the finest SBA district offices in the country, if not the finest. The bill also addresses a concern which many small businesses across the country have brought to our attention. That is the issue of Federal Government bundling of procurement contracts. The bill takes steps to help ensure that small firms can compete for Federal contracts, and that the Government's use of bundling is strictly warranted when it occurs. 
Mr. President, I hope the House of Representatives also will act soon on their version of the bill, and I look forward to voting for passage of a conference report so the bill can be sent to the President. Thank you.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, this is not an amendment, and I know the managers are not here. It is not really a debate I am trying to generate here. I thought I would take a little bit of time, while I have the floor, to thank the managers of the bill for their work. Really, I think they have done a very, very impressive job, especially when you consider what they have been able to put into this bill. 
These amendments that I have introduced have more to do with what is not in the bill, and we will be debating that later. I want to also thank the managers of the bill for including an important item in this appropriations measure. This bill, on the Senate side, it is my understanding, includes the full amount requested by the President for the budget of the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration. 
As the ranking member of the Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I am very interested in this whole area of occupational health and safety. But, today, what I want to do is talk about one aspect of this policy, and that is the sampling of coal mine dust and its relation to black lung disease. Madam President, this is of particular interest to me because of a recent trip that I took to eastern Kentucky. I met with a number of coal miners, and I do think that their story deserves to be told. It is a story that I intend to follow, hopefully, as we in the Congress take further steps to make sure that the Federal Government lives up to its responsibility regarding miners' health and safety. 
Mining has been really one of the most dangerous professions, and the Federal Government has done much to correct or address some of its hazards. But what I want to focus on is the Mine Safety and Health Administration and a request for new staff and money--which we have on the Senate side, it is my understanding--to increase the Federal Government's sampling for respirable coal mine dust. The request is modest, but it is significant; it calls for 24 new full-time employees and $1.7 million. 
Madam President, though it is a small amount of money, I think it is very important that we keep this in conference. Last year, there was an advisory committee appointed by the Secretary of Labor, which recommended that a key step that the Federal Government could take toward eliminating black lung disease would be to increase the responsibilities of the Mine Safety and Health Administration for coal mine dust compliance sampling. Simply speaking, that is a measurement of coal mine dust levels to determine whether or not they are a threat to the miners' health. 
Madam President, the problem is that the majority of the dust sampling is done by the mineowners themselves--that is to say the coal companies. When I was in east Kentucky last week, what I heard over and over again were really miners describing conditions that I think many Senators would feel like they were in a time warp and they were really living 50 years ago. We are talking about too many miners who work in crawl spaces about this high for 12 or 14 hours a day and can't see 6 inches in front of them because of the dust level. So the problem is, when you depend upon the companies to actually do the measurements of the dust levels, there is a pretty obvious conflict of interest. As a Senator, I am not naive to these conditions. Most of my work has been in communities around the country, starting in Minnesota, with hard-pressed people. 
I met a woman--to expand this discussion--whose husband had begged the company over and over again to please give him some relief from his particular work situation. He was afraid he was going to be electrocuted. Basically, the position of the company was: Look, if you don't like the job, leave. When there aren't a lot of $20-an-hour jobs, people don't have much of a choice. She spoke. She was 27 years of age. Her husband was electrocuted. He lost his life. 
I met other miners suffering from black lung. I met one woman, and she is the only woman who is a deep mine miner. I said, `Aren't you afraid * * *'--the common complaint is that most of the mines are nonunion, and if people complain, they lose their jobs. I said, `Aren't you afraid * * *'--since there were TV cameras in Hazard, KY--I said, `Aren't you afraid that you are going to lose your job?' 
She said, `I don't think I will because I am the only woman miner. I don't think they will let me go. I feel like I am speaking for a lot of other miners that aren't here.' 
I said to her and to the other 12 or 14 miners sitting around talking, `Look, I have to ask you this question. Can you tell me very honestly and truthfully, if all of your friends and coworkers could be here, without fear of losing their jobs, would they be saying the same thing, or are you exaggerating in any kind of way?' 
All of them, starting with this woman miner said, `They would say the same thing to you, except that people are afraid they may lose their jobs.' 
I will tell you, it was a very, very powerful meeting. So this is a small step here to make sure there is some additional money for at least some compliance of the dust sampling. But it is terribly important. 
Let me read from the testimony of Earl Shackleford, Jr., from Wallins Creek in Harlan County, KY. He was 36 years old last year. This was presented last year to the Secretary of Labor's advisory committee on the elimination of black lung disease. He had been working as a miner 17 years, though he is only 36. His testimony indicates that he, his father, his grandfather, and other friends and relatives all suffer from black lung disease. Someone from my wife Sheila's family from Cumberland in Harlan County, KY, also suffered from black lung disease. I will read four sentences from the conclusion of Mr. Shackleford's testimony:  
There is nothing more terrible to me than watching a fellow coal miner smother to death, one slow gasp at a time. There is nothing anybody can do for a dying miner but pray for him. But we can do something for the miners who labor in the mines today. We can make sure that the coal dust they breathe is accurately monitored by a Government that cares about their health and safety. 
Madam President, this bill takes a step toward better Federal monitoring of coal mine dust sampling. I hope we can keep this additional funding in the conference committee. At the same time, I point out that I agree with the recommendation of the Secretary's advisory committee on the elimination of black lung disease, which is that the Federal Government should take more responsibility in this area--perhaps full responsibility--of dust sampling. 
I am going to be working with other colleagues. Eventually, I want to come to the floor and push very hard on this. The story of these Kentucky coal miners cannot be ignored. I had a chance to talk to Senator Ford, who has cared about these issues and about what the miners are facing. The testimony of Earl Shackleford, Jr., and others, cannot be ignored. 
I would like to thank the managers again of this bill for putting money in here for at least some compliance work. I hope we can keep that in conference committee. 
I want to say to colleagues that one of the best things about getting a chance to travel sometimes outside of your State--not necessarily to another country, but in other communities --and for me, focusing on poverty in the country has been a tremendous education and very important. I met a lot of people who should be famous, a lot of strong people who, under incredibly difficult conditions, can still manage to survive and not only survive but flourish. But of all the meetings I have been to and of all the things I have seen--and I have seen a lot of children and a lot of pain, and I have seen a lot of housing that nobody should ever have to live in, and I have seen schools that are just as dilapidated as the schools that we talk about, where you can walk in the hallway and you can smell the stench of urine, and you can go into the bathrooms where the toilets don't even work, I have seen all that and more than I want to see. But this meeting with these coal miners in eastern Kentucky was jolting. 
I asked one of the journalists that was there, off the record, to tell me whether or not she thought they were exaggerating. She said, `Absolutely not.' My guess is that in some of the investigative work that I hope will be done by journalists, we are going to see more reports of these conditions. We are talking about conditions that these coal miners are working under that we thought existed 50 years ago--people not able to see 6 inches in front of them because of the dust levels, which not only means people are gone to go suffer from and die from black lung, it also means, it is my understanding, that when you have that high concentration of dust levels, you have the ingredients for all kinds of possibilities of explosions within the mine. And then somebody will talk about a mine accident as if it were impersonal and random and never should have happened. 
We have a huge problem here because the coal mine operators, the companies, are actually the ones doing the measurement of the dust levels. I don't see how we can really get an independent and accurate measurement of the dust levels and how that affects these miners, unless we do much better by way of expanding the responsibility or at least the resources for the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration. 
I am sure other people in the Senate would say the same thing. But it is very difficult to meet with people and have a couple of people talk about loved ones who were killed in the mines. I still cannot remember. She is 27 years old. Her husband was 28 years old when he was electrocuted. I have met a lot of the older miners who were suffering with black lung. For reasons I don't actually understand the actual motive for being turned down when they applied for disability, which is something I want to know more about. 
But at the very least, I think we have to make sure that somehow the clock has not been turned back 50 years. People ought not to have to work under conditions which are uncivilized. People have every right in our country to be able to focus on how they earn a decent living and how they have a job that pays a decent wage under civilized working conditions. The miners in eastern Kentucky, or some of the miners and the miners that I met with, should not be in a situation where if they should speak up about this, they lose their jobs. The choice for them is whether you do and, if you work, you work under these uncivilized conditions and it is going to take years off your life, possibly kill you, or you don't work and you lose your job. 
I know that some of these issues are just like off the radar screen here in the Senate. But I think really this should be part of our focus. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. As I understand what the Senator from Massachusetts is saying in reply or in response to the Senator from Pennsylvania is that we want to try and finish but there are some other Senators that want to speak and the Senator is right, I would like to speak. 
I think it is a shame we did not have an agreement. We should have. This is a very reasonable second degree, I think, but I want to make it clear to my colleague from Pennsylvania I would like to speak, and I can be relatively brief.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Texas wants to focus on the black-robed judges, but I think his analysis is a bit ahistorical. Rudolph Giuliani, former U.S. attorney, 1988: `To date, the United States Government is bringing the lawsuit to attack and reverse once and for all the major American scandal.' Richard Thornburgh, Attorney General, March 14, 1989--not a black-robed judge: `This settlement, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, culminates 30 years of efforts by the Department of Justice to remove the influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union.' 
This was an agreement with a Republican administration. The second-degree amendment here, the Kennedy amendment, simply says, nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to expenditures required by the consent decree in United States versus The International Brotherhood of Teamsters. My colleague from Oklahoma wants to say there isn't anything in his amendment that goes against this consent agreement. If so, this second-degree amendment should be acceptable. We should not even be having this debate. 
Now, I heard what my colleague from Texas said about the need to not be personal. I won't be. Let me make a different kind of argument. When, all of a sudden and unrelated to the bill on the floor, there is an amendment that goes after a consent agreement that goes back to the actions of a Republican administration, and when that all-of-a-sudden move on the Senate floor follows only a few short weeks from a very inspiring and successful effort on the part of the Teamsters to collectively bargain, and when this effort, unrelated to the bill on the floor all of a sudden comes up just a few short weeks after many people in the country are saying, thank goodness there is a focus on trying to have full-time jobs as opposed to part-time jobs, thank goodness there is a focus on living-wage jobs, thank goodness those of us who are hard-pressed and struggling to earn a decent living and raise our children well are going to have a chance, I think this is the wrong time for such an extraordinary move. 
I don't think we can decontextualize what we do on the floor of the Senate. It would be a little foolish to believe that, whatever the intentions are of colleagues, people in the country, many working families, union or nonunion, won't look upon this effort as just payback. That will be the perception. That is the way it looks in terms of the chronology of this. That is the way it looks in terms of the timeliness of this. That is the way it looks in terms of this action by the Senate, following up on the successful effort on the part of a union to bargain collectively. 
Finally, once again, it is such an extraordinary move to go against an agreement that a Republican administration was a part of and to take this extraordinary, and I think really very imprudent, action. Senator Kennedy's second-degree amendment is reasonable. It just says--and I will finish--nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to expenditures required by the consent decree. Whatever those expenditures are or are not, this amendment just says, look, we don't come out here on the floor--it is not in the dark of night, but all of a sudden--with this kind of major move, and I think this is an extremely reasonable second-degree amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to respond. I know the majority leader wants to respond. 
First of all, if the Senator was listening carefully, I said, whatever the intention, it just seemed to me that it is hard contextually with what we do from what is happening outside the Senate. And I think it is a big mistake to do this. I think many people will view this as nothing less than an effort to retaliate. 
That is my position. Whether or not I am right or wrong, I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania that the proof will be in the pudding. We will see how people in the country respond. We will see what interpretation people put on this. I think it is a big mistake. I think this is a real overreach. 
As I tried to do in this debate, I went back through the history of this. I make it crystal clear. Richard Thornburgh, in this settlement of March 14, 1989, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, said culminates 30 years of efforts by the Department of Justice to remove the influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union. We are saying in the second-degree amendment that nothing that we do should be construed to apply to expenditures. 
Don't overreach, and don't take an imprudent action, and don't try to overturn this. That is profoundly mistaken. 
That is my argument. And that will continue to be my argument, irrespective of what some of my other colleagues believe.

Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct. 
Just one question, because the Senator has been on the 
floor and I have been listening very carefully. It initially started out as a debate. I expressed my concern that I thought whatever the intentions were--I said good intentions--on the part of the colleagues, but that I thought that you really couldn't talk about this except in the context of what has happened with the Teamsters, and I thought this was profoundly mistaken. But now, what the Senator has been doing as a lawyer is--I am a lay person. I have been listening very carefully. As I understand the Senator, what he is really saying is that the most serious part of this above and beyond my concerns is that it really does--as the Senator from Oklahoma said earlier, he didn't see this as being anything in contradiction with the consent decree--the Senator from Maryland is arguing that it is most certainly in contradiction, in which case it becomes a very dangerous intrusion into the judiciary. 
Is that correct? Is that the legal principle here, and the government principle?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say in response to my colleague from Iowa, I think there are Senators who want to speak on it. I don't know whether or not there will be time tonight in order to accommodate different people who want to comment on this amendment. 
But as I understand it, and I will just try to summarize, there are two different sets of concerns I have. One set of concerns which I would repeat has to do not with the intentions of colleagues at all but has to do just with the sequence of events, the chronology. I just think that there is a great deal of discussion about what the UPS workers did. This was a Teamsters strike. There was a focus on the need to have more full-time jobs as opposed to part-time jobs. There was a focus on living-wage jobs. 
The interesting thing is that I think the public really rallied behind the UPS workers. I think that the public felt that what the workers were talking about, what this union was talking about, was how you earn a decent living and how you are able to give your children the care you know they need and they deserve. 
I think that this amendment, the Nickles-Craig amendment, is such an overreach because now what we have, just on the heels of this successful effort on the part of Teamsters to bargain collectively, is an effort--and now I have listened to this; I am not a labor lawyer--but an effort which essentially overturns a consent decree which was extremely important and essentially says we are going to go right to the heart of the judiciary and go back to an agreement which goes back, what, 30 years or thereabouts. I am sorry, this was initially agreed to in--I had it before me. Might I ask the Senator from Massachusetts a moment, the original agreement with the Bush administration was in 1989?

Mr. WELLSTONE. In 1989. I have quoted Attorney General Thornburgh on this. The idea was, look, this was, as my colleague from Maryland has said, an unprecedented situation. We were talking about corruption. We were talking about workers who want to have a fair election. And we finally had, after 30 years, an agreement here. 
Now, this election has not yet been certified. The Kennedy amendment made no judgment about expenditure of money. But the idea of essentially trying to overturn this consent agreement, to interfere directly with the judicial branch, to really preempt what kind of ruling a judge might make before any kind of ruling has been made, and to do this on an appropriations bill, is profoundly mistaken. It is not prudent. So there are a number of Senators who have come to the floor and have raised a whole set of questions. 
The Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, raised some questions having to do with the judicial appointments being blocked here--now, yet, a kind of threat to interfere with the judicial branch of Government--and whether or not this just was not the kind of political interference which is very inappropriate. He made the point that he felt that, as a Senator, if you were going to make a wise decision about this you would have to be in opposition to this amendment. 
Senator Kennedy started out tonight talking about both the context of this, the UPS workers and the successful effort on the part of the Teamsters, and now this--what is this all about? Just raising questions about the timing of it. But, then, more important, or just as important, Senator Sarbanes has been on the floor and he has, I think, provided many of us his view--I certainly include myself, and this was essentially the position I think the Senator from Pennsylvania has taken--which is this is just an overreach. I mean, to just try to overturn or basically contradict or subvert this consent agreement, to interfere with the judicial branch, is a profound mistake. 
So, my colleague from Alabama is correct. The point was that there would be a vote after Senators had a chance to fully discuss this. But, from my point of view, there are now three sets of questions that have been raised that I think are extremely important. Other Senators may want to discuss this as well. Or we might be able to reach some kind of agreement as to how we proceed. But, I think this is something that, if the Senate is a deliberative body, then we need to be very deliberative about this. 
We had an agreement with a Republican administration, the Bush administration, which really dealt with 30 years' history. It was important. It was an effort to root out corruption. We had an agreement that was, I think, a very important step forward. Now what we have is an effort to essentially overturn that agreement. Now what we have is an effort to directly intervene or interfere with the judicial branch. Now we have an effort, which I think on political grounds, and probably on constitutional grounds, though I am not a lawyer, I am not even sure that, from a constitutional point of view--I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania may have raised this question--we should even be doing this, and for that reason there are a number of us who have been out on the floor and have been speaking about this. 
If other Senators want to speak, I have had an opportunity several times tonight to raise these concerns. Senator Sarbanes was on the floor a long time, I think really zeroing in on what the implications of this are, just in terms of branches of Government and separation of powers and what our constitutional system is about, which I think are pretty important questions. And one more time, as a Senator from Minnesota who had a chance to see what these workers were able to do and who strongly supported, I think, the justice, the justice goals of the strike--I have raised concerns about. I don't think it looks good. I don't think it's the right thing to do for the Senate to be involved in such an overreach, taking such drastic action, which I think, unfortunately, certainly looks like--I don't know what the motivations are of Senators--that it is very connected to this UPS workers' strike. 
Mr. President, I will not speak any longer on the floor of the Senate. I will yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. 
Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that will ensure that private health insurance companies pay for substance abuse treatment services at the same level that they pay for treatment for other diseases. In other words, it is meant to guarantee that insurance coverage for substance abuse treatment is provided in a nondiscriminatory manner. This bill, the Substance Abuse Parity Act of 1997, provides this assurance. 
For too long, the problem of substance abuse has been viewed as a moral issue, rather than a disease. A cloak of secrecy has surrounded this problem, as people who have this disease are often ashamed and afraid to admit their problem, for fear that they will be seen as admitting a weakness in character. We have all seen portrayals of alcoholics and addicts that are intended to be humorous or derogatory, and only reinforce the biases against people who have problems with substance abuse. Can you imagine this type of portrayal of someone who has a cardiac problem, or who happens to carry a gene that predisposes them to diabetes? 
Yet it has been shown that some forms of addiction have a genetic basis, and we still try to hide the seriousness of this problem. We forget that someone who has a problem with drugs or alcohol can look just like the person we see in the mirror, or the person who is sitting next to us on a plane. In fact, it is unlikely that any of us have not experienced substance abuse within our families or our circle of friends. 
The statistics concerning substance abuse are startling. In a recent article in Scientific American, December 1996, it was reported that excessive alcohol consumption is estimated to cause more than 100,000 deaths in the United States each year. Of these deaths, 24 percent are due to drunken driving, 11 percent are homicides, and 8 percent are suicides. Alcohol contributes to cancers of the esophagus, larynx, and oral cavity, which account for 17 percent of the deaths. Strokes related to alcohol use account for another nine percent of deaths. Alcohol causes several other ailments such as cirrhosis of the liver. These ailments account for 18 percent of the deaths. 
We know that alcohol and other drugs contribute to other problems as well. Addictive substances have the potential for destroying the person who is addicted, their family and their other relationships. In a 1993 Report to Congress on Alcohol and Health, the Secretary of Health and Human Services stated that `Alcohol is associated with a substantial proportion of human violence, and perpetrators are often under the influence of alcohol.' There are high rates of alcohol and other drug involvement in domestic violence and child abuse. For example, in 1987, 64 percent of all reported child abuse and neglect cases in the city of New York were related to alcohol and other drug abuse. With respect to domestic violence, a study of over 2,000 American couples demonstrated that rates of domestic violence were almost 15 times higher in households where husbands were often drunk as compared to those households in which they were never drunk. And, alcohol has been shown to be present in over 50 percent of all incidents of domestic violence. In addition, substance use itself may result from direct experience with interpersonal violence, as demonstrated by a study of 472 women. This study showed that 87 percent of alcoholic women had been physically or sexually abused as children as compared to 59 percent of the nonalcoholic women in the study. We know that over 40 percent of motor vehicle crash fatalities are alcohol-related, and that many of the alcohol drinkers involved in these crashes have had long standing problems with alcohol abuse. It is estimated that over 25 percent of emergency department visits may be alcohol related, and that alcohol and other drug use accounts for at least 40 percent of hospital admissions. 
Data from the 1996 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, which is conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, provide the following estimates of substance use in the United States:  
ALCOHOL 
There were about 9 million current alcohol, including beer, wine, and distilled spirits, drinkers under age 21 in 1996. Of these, 4.4 million were binge drinkers, including 1.9 million heavy drinkers. 
MARIJUANA 
In 1996, an estimated 10.1 million Americans were current, past month, marijuana or hashish users. This represents 4.7 percent of the population aged 12 and older. 
Marijuana is by far the most prevalent drug used by illicit drug users. Approximately three-quarters, 77 percent of current illicit drug users were marijuana or hashish users in 1996. 
COCAINE 
The number of occasional cocaine users, people who used in the past year but on fewer than 12 days, was 2.6 million in 1996, similar to what it was in 1995. The number of users was down significantly from 1985, when it was 7.1 million. 
HALLUCINOGENS 
The rate of current use of hallucinogens among youth age 12-17 has nearly doubled in 2 years, 1.1 percent in 1994, 1.7 percent in 1995, and 2.0 percent in 1996. 
HEROIN 
There were an estimated 141,000 new heroin users in 1995, and there has been an increasing trend in new heroin use since 1992. A large proportion of these recent new users were smoking, snorting, or sniffing heroin, and most were under age 26. The rate of heroin initiation for the age group 12-17 reached historic levels. 
We know what the problems are, and we can document them. But we have done little to treat the problems or prevent them. In order to decrease the violence, the domestic violence, child abuse, homicide, suicide, the motor vehicle crashes, the cancers and the other illnesses and deaths due to alcohol and drug use, we must treat the alcohol and drug abuse problems. But right now, even if treatment is available and accessible, it is often unaffordable, as many health plans do not pay for treatment for substance abuse at the same rate at which they pay for treatment of other diseases. This seems counterintuitive, given the relationship between substance use and other diseases. It would only seem logical that if we are willing to pay for the treatment of substance abuse, we would decrease costs of treatment for other diseases in the long run, as we would decrease the occurrence of those diseases that are related to substance abuse.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues, and especially Senator Coats, for their courtesy. I was not able to come to the floor earlier, and sometimes if we feel strongly about an issue we will have a chance to speak before the vote. I thank him, and I thank Senator Stevens and others as well. 
I do not know quite where to start. Last night we passed an amendment, and this was work I was fortunate enough to get a chance to do with Senator McCain, and I think we had 97 votes to expand funding for Parkinson's disease. It was an enormous victory. I believe that kind of strong vote will serve us very well in conference committee, and I believe finally we will be able to get some funding. 
There has been so little funding. It has not been fair, and people who have been struggling with this disease have been here for several years now. They have become their own advocates. The only reason we had such a strong vote last night was because of their work. 
My colleague, Senator Coats, was gracious enough to raise his concern through this amendment separately from that vote. He is someone here in the Senate that I believe in. I think he speaks for what he thinks is right. This amendment he introduces in very good faith. 
I will be the opposite of shrill in my opposition. I think the amendment is profoundly mistaken. We have gone through this whole debate about fetal tissue research, and I again want to make it clear that not only have we not seen one instance of abuse, not one example, but we really have very, very stringent and clear protections. A woman may not be approached for consent to donate aborted tissue. The donor may not be paid for donation of the tissue. The donor may not designate who will be the recipient of the tissue. Violations of these restrictions are a Federal felony, punishable by 10 years in Federal prison. 
I say all that because I want to make it clear how strict the guidelines are. I also want to make it clear that I do not think this issue is really about using the labels pro-choice or pro-life, but it has to do with another question, which is whether or not people who are struggling with the disease are going to be able to look to a day where there will be a cure. If this amendment passes, we are essentially wiping out one very promising avenue of research. I think that would be a very crucial thing to do. That is certainly not the intention of the amendment. 
I say to my colleagues, because I have been active in this work dealing with Parkinson's since I came to the Senate, I know something about it, having had two parents who struggled with Parkinson's. I know something about it, having spent a great deal of time with people in the Parkinson's community, that given the strict guidelines and given the fact that we do not see examples of abuse, and given the fact that this really is not about pro-choice and pro-life, and also given the fact that if this kind of amendment is going to be raised it ought not to be focused on one disease, I just hope that my colleagues will oppose this amendment. I think it is profoundly mistaken. 
Now, Mr. President, just forget all of the statistics, except to say, and I think my colleagues will believe me, that if you talk to people in the medical research community they will tell you that fetal tissue transplant research is one of the very promising approaches. I do not think we want to `defund' that. We do not want to be in a position of, on the one hand, finding resources for research, and then essentially wiping out one of the very important modes of research to find a cure for the disease. We do not want to do that. It really undercuts part of the very important vote that took place last night. 
Maybe the best way for me to summarize my view, because we will vote in just a few minutes, is to talk about a woman that some of you have come to know. Her name is Joan Samuelson. I have not asked for permission to do this, but Joan has been so visible and so vocal I do not think she will object. I first met her a number of years ago when she was testifying before our committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee. I think she was speaking about the need to have at least a little bit more by way of resources for research, but I think she was talking about, if my memory serves me correctly, about this fetal tissue research. 
What I remember was I kept thinking about my parents. My father was almost 60 when he found out he had Parkinson's and he lived to be 84, though at the very end I will tell you, if you do not know this disease, he was so alert. He was a brilliant man. I am not objective, he was my father. He spoke 10 languages fluently but it did not help. He spoke 10 languages fluently, but because of Parkinson's he could not speak. He could not walk. And really the truth of the matter is he intensely wanted to die. That is exactly what he indicated to me. 
When Joan Samuelson testified, I kept thinking, gee, she is in her thirties. What is going to be her future? If you are lucky, this disease runs a slow progression, but you never know. You do not want to find out you have Parkinson's when you are in your thirties. By the way, it is a myth that this is a disease that only afflicts the elderly. 
When Joan Samuelson testified, more than anything what she was saying is, `Look, for me and many others, time is not neutral. How can you say to me that you are only willing to invest about $30 per person for the 1 million of us who struggle with Parkinson's? How can you look at me in the eye and say that? This is my life or whether I will have a life.' 
The reason I raise this is I remember hearing her testify and thinking about my parents and sort of just then starting to have tears in my own eyes because I was thinking I don't want someone like Joan Samuelson to get to the place where my dad did. I don't want that to happen to her. 
Now, I am not a doctor. I cannot guarantee there will be a cure to this disease tomorrow. But when I spoke to Joan Samuelson two nights ago, she is out in California, she said to me, `The way I look at this debate on fetal tissue research is this is the particular research that I think could very well lead to a cure for me.' That is the point. Please, everybody, that is the point. 
Whatever your position is on the general question of pro-choice, pro-life, that is not what this debate is about. To someone like Joan Samuelson, this is one avenue of research that could very well lead to a cure for this disease. That is of central importance to her. That is of central importance to the lives of many other people struggling with Parkinson's. I think that is what this vote is about. 
So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to please vote against this amendment. I feel like I have to, in good faith, conclude by saying, even though I hope there will be a strong vote against this amendment, one more time I want to make it crystal clear that Senator Coats is doing what he thinks is right. Senator Coats has supported this effort to expand the funding for Parkinson's. Senator Coats knows this disease all too well. I believe his father had Parkinson's. Senator Coats, when he does something on the floor of the Senate does it because he believes in it. He does it because he thinks it is the right thing. 
I deeply appreciate the support he has given Senator McCain and myself on our efforts, but I think this amendment is a mistake. Actually, I want to say I know this amendment is a mistake, because I really believe it is all about someone like Joan Samuelson. We ought not to vote for the Mo Udall Parkinson's Research Act, the amendment last night introduced by Senator McCain and myself, and then turn around and essentially defund one of the important avenues of research that potentially could lead to a cure for this disease. I think that would be an injustice to Joan Samuelson and many other women and men who struggle with this disease. I hope my colleagues will vote against this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I actually will be brief. I had a chance yesterday to speak in opposition to the amendment of my colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl. I know that other Senators have spoken about this as well. 
I was on the floor early this morning when both Senator Specter and Senator Harkin spoke about it. Mr. President, the part of the Kyl amendment which I am sympathetic to, and my guess is that a good many other Senators are sympathetic to it as well, would be the effort to try to expand funding for the Pell Grant Program. And, Mr. President, as my colleague, Senator Harkin from Iowa, said earlier this morning, interestingly enough, the Pell Grant Program, named after Claiborne Pell, our Senator--I think all of us really came to admire and believe in Claiborne Pell--really does represent a kind of positive role for the public sector, for Government, because what we as a country have decided is that there are certain decisive areas of life in a nation where you do not just leave it up to a market verdict. 
If, in fact, you have a family, a young person or not such a young person who cannot afford higher education, there is a role to make sure that man or that woman can afford to go on to college, especially since this is becoming more and more important in determining how they will do economically or how their families will do. 
Indeed, there is a statistic that is a shameful statistic that we have had since the late 1970's, about an 8-percent graduation rate from colleges and universities of those men and women from families with incomes under $20,000 a year, the main reason being that they have not been able to afford to go on and get their higher education. 
I said this yesterday--and I will have an amendment that will try to speak to this today or tomorrow--it is also true that with all the discussion about HOPE scholarships and tax credits, since they are not refundable, all families with incomes below $28,000 a year are not going to become eligible. So we still have a huge hole, especially for those students from moderate- and low-income families. So it seems to me, if we are going to be talking about providing support for higher education and for families and for young men and women and older men and women--many of our students are older now in our community colleges--we ought to make sure that low-income are included. 
The problem with the Kyl amendment is that he takes the funding from the LIHEAP, the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program, which is a lifeline program for very vulnerable families, especially for those of us who represent cold weather States, although part of low-income energy assistance is also, I say to the Chair, since he is from the great State of North Carolina, some of it also is for cooling assistance. I think it was two summers ago that we had a number of people in Chicago, poor people, who died, elderly people, from exposure to heat. They just could not afford air conditioning. 
So, Mr. President, what the Kyl amendment does is it rescinds about $500 million, takes about half of what is in a $1 billion program--it has already been cut way down--and it essentially ends the program. 
Mr. President, I just want people to know, my colleagues to know--I think they do--I think we are going to have a strong vote in opposition to the amendment, and that the vast majority of the recipients of an energy grant is maybe $300 a year, or thereabouts. It is a lifeline program. It just enables an elderly person to be able to afford heat and not have to then spend more than she can afford and, therefore, not be able to get ahold of a prescription drug she needs or maybe have to cut back on food on the table. 
It is not much. It is extremely important. The vast majority of the citizens--there are about 110,000 households in Minnesota that have participated, have incomes under $8,000 a year. These are not wealthy people or middle-income people. These are people who are hard pressed. This is a lifeline program. It represents the goodness in us. And we cannot be gutting this program. 
I have been involved in this fight to kind of maintain or protect the LIHEAP program for the last 3 or 4 years. I do not know why we have to go through this every time. 
Mr. President, let me just make it clear that if you wanted to expand the Pell Grant Program, I can think of other ways to do it. I mean, now we know that with the B-2, the stealth bomber program, we have planes that cannot fly in the rain or the snow. I mean, I will have an amendment later on that will say, let us not build any more of these turkeys. And you can just transfer that funding for the Pell Grant Program. But do not take it out of low-income energy assistance. 
I see my colleague from Pennsylvania here. I thank him for his graciousness in allowing me to have some time to speak about this. But again, colleagues have heard it from the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, Senator Harkin, any number of Senators who have come to the floor on this. And, again, I hope there will be a strong vote against the amendment. 
It is extremely important. It is a matter of elementary decency, if you will, to provide people with some support that they need. It is a lifeline support program. And I tell you, to a cold weather State like Minnesota, it is very important. We already know in Minnesota right now that we are going to have to ask for some additional emergency energy assistance. We did last winter. That is what happens. This is an underfunded program, not overfunded. The only reason I do not have an amendment calling for more funding is I know the White House, the administration, has been good about providing that emergency funding for States that need it. 
So, Mr. President, the last thing in the world that makes any sense is to essentially gut this program by rescinding $500 million. To all my colleagues, I hope you will vote against this amendment. To Senator Kyl, who is a Senator that I like and respect, I think you are profoundly mistaken with this amendment, as much as I appreciate your good work here. I hope that we will have a very strong bipartisan vote against this amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I could talk at some length about this amendment, and I will not. I will just make a few introductory comments, and then my colleague, Senator McCain, will speak on this. 
We have, I believe, close to 66, or thereabouts, cosponsors. This amendment, which I am very proud to offer today, is really an amendment that is named after Mo Udall, who was a very distinguished Representative in the House of Representatives and somebody that many people here have a great deal of love and respect for. 
This amendment would call for 10 Parkinson's research centers. This would be $100 million a year. The reason for this amendment is that Parkinson's disease is a devastating neurological disease. Probably my colleagues are very familiar with it. They may have had a loved one who suffered from it. I had two parents who suffered from Parkinson's disease. 
Mr. President, what happens with people with Parkinson's is that there is a tremendous problem with shaking, people have difficulty walking, and many people have really found it difficult to be, if you will, their own lobbyist. People have found it difficult to speak for themselves. 
But what has happened in the last several years is that there has been a wonderful group of people who have come here. The Udall family has been very, very important in this whole struggle. In addition, Joan Samuelson, with the Parkinson's Action Network, has been really critical to this. They have come here and I think have met with Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike. This is a bipartisan effort we have on the floor of the Senate. They have essentially said to all of us, `Time is not on our side. We have the research that we can point to. It is such promising research. We are on the cuspis of major breakthroughs, but if we do not at least increase this funding for research for many of us, we really will not have that much of a future.' 
Mr. President, there are a million people in our country, men and women who struggle with Parkinson's disease. Up to now, we have been spending about $30 per person. It is a really shamefully low amount of money that we have spent. Very little has been invested. 
But now these men and women, this community, has come to the Nation's Capital. They have met with all of us, and they have made their case. I am very honored to offer this amendment with Senator McCain. I hope we will get very, very strong support. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as original cosponsors to this amendment Senator Craig, Senator Burns, Senator Durbin, Senator Ford, Senator D'Amato, Senator Breaux, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Santorum, Senator Johnson, Senator Snowe, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Hollings, Senator Torricelli, Senator Faircloth, Senator Levin, and Senator Lautenberg.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to add one final word to what my colleague, Senator McCain, has had to say. Above and beyond the organizations that Senator McCain recognized for their fine work, and above and beyond Mo Udall, this amendment comes from legislation which, as I said, is really named after Mo Udall, for reasons I don't need to explain to any colleague. I also would like to thank, but I want to do this carefully, Muhammad Ali, who has been very courageous, and I use that word carefully. Muhammad Ali struggles with Parkinson's, and he could have chosen to have had the world or the country have only seen him as he was when he was in his prime as a boxer. Instead, he has been very public, very visible and a very, very strong advocate, not just for himself but for many, many other people. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, and I know that my colleague from Indiana is going to have a second-degree amendment which I think really adds strength to this and he has some very thoughtful and important questions to raise or comments to make, but I am going to end on a personal note. I want to say to everybody here that we really do need to have a strong vote, and we need to keep this in conference. 
When Senator McCain was talking about this disorder and what it does to people, I remember when L-Dopa, the first drug, came out. My father was in the original pilot group. For a while, L-Dopa helped, but then it reached the point where it did not. With my father, Leon Wellstone, at the very end, he not only could not walk, and he was a writer and his hand would shake and he could not type, but, in addition, he could not even speak. 
It can be so ravaging to people. It can be so devastating. The reason we have brought this amendment to the floor is that it is an equity question. So precious little has been invested in Parkinson's research at the very time when there is such potential for big breakthroughs. 
I want to make it clear to everybody that we have had the Parkinson's community come here to Washington, and they have come year after year for the last 3 or 4 years that they have been working on this. Each time, we make progress, and then at the very end, for some reason, they get shut out. 
So I make a plea to people on the basis of please vote for this funding. It is just a matter of elementary fairness and justice. It is just a matter of equity. Please don't shut people out. I just don't want to see people who have been so courageous and who have come here and have struggled so hard not be successful in this Senate and in this House of Representatives. We have to pass this legislation. It really would be a wonderful vote, and it really would make a huge difference in the lives of many of our neighbors and many of our friends who are men and women of enormous worth and enormous dignity and enormous substance. Nothing I say is said out of pity, it is said out of respect for the dignity of people. I just would like to say one more time, I hope we will get a huge vote for this amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question? And I say to my colleague from Maine, I will not go with other questions as I know she wants to speak, and I had a chance to speak yesterday. 
Isn't it also true, taking the experience of last winter--and I could ask this of the chairman as well, Senator Specter--what has been happening, because we have really been underfunded, we depend on the emergency funding and we go through this drill every year where then what we have to do is seek this additional emergency funding? We certainly had to do that last year. And then, of course, States never know what they are going to be able to do. So the last thing we should be doing, am I correct, is cutting $500 million? 
It would gut the whole program.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I do not know whether or not my colleague, Senator Kyl from Arizona, will be back today or whether we will come back to his amendment tomorrow, but I want to just very briefly comment on his amendment. 
The Kyl amendment, as I understand it--I have the amendment before me--amounts essentially to over a $500 million rescission, if you will, in funding for what is called LIHEAP, the low-income energy assistance program. We have seen cuts over the years in this low-income energy assistance program. It is really now under a billion dollars total. So in many ways we would essentially, if this amendment passes, be dealing with the end of the program. 
Mr. President, I actually would come to the floor and have an amendment which would call for an increase in funding for low-income energy assistance. And the reason I do not is that we have been sort of going through the same drill every year, which is that come the cold winter months--this happens in Minnesota; it happens in many of our cold-weather States--what happens is, because we do not have enough by way of appropriations, because the vast majority of these families are families with incomes under $7,000 or $8,000 a year, because about half the people helped are children, because close to 50 percent of these families are working poor families, they work 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, and because, Mr. President, these grants, this assistance, represents a kind of lifeline for people so they are not faced with the choice of `Do I pay for my heat? Then I can't afford prescription drugs or I can't afford food,' we have been supportive of this. 
What happens, though not as supportive as we should be, the administration provides additional emergency funds because, you know, whether it be in Minnesota or Indiana, I suppose, as well, what happens is that at the county level where the people live, at the grassroots level, we get calls. And these are desperation calls. So we actually provide a supplement to what we have in the bill by way of emergency funding. But for a State like Minnesota or Indiana it is a bit of a nightmare to plan. People never know. They never know. 
So now we have an amendment which would really just make this situation, which is not great--we do not have the funding that we should have for a program that helps people so they do not go cold. That is a kind of minimal standard of decency. It certainly is important to a cold-weather State like Minnesota. But now if this amendment was to pass--I do not think it will; I hope we will have a strong vote against it--it would be a nightmare. 
I just want to say to my colleague, whom I enjoy, that the part of the amendment which deals with expanding funding for the Pell grant I am all for. I think one of the things that was overlooked in the budget agreement--I think there was a bit too much exaggeration about how we were going to make sure that higher education was affordable for all our students because, to repeat one more time, the tax credit which goes to the HOPE scholarship program is not refundable. So if you come from a family below $27,000 a year, you may not be eligible, and many of the community college students in Minnesota are not. 
We also expanded the Pell grant a little bit, but if you talk to the financial aid officers around the country, I think all of them will tell you that the most effective, efficient way of providing the necessary support for young or not such young students--many of our students are older--to be able to afford higher education is the Pell grants. 
So I say to my colleague, it is a laudable goal. I will have an amendment on the floor to provide some additional funding for the Pell grants in this country. But you cannot do that on the backs of some of the poorest, most vulnerable 
citizens in the United States of America. I mean, you cannot take away energy assistance from people who, if they do not receive this emergency assistance during cold winters, could very well go cold or maybe pay for heat but then not have enough to eat. This is just an unacceptable trade-off. 
I am disappointed we have to go through this whole fight again, but, you know, all of us do what we think is right. I know my colleague from Arizona is doing this because he thinks it is the right thing to do. But we have had very strong bipartisan support over the LIHEAP Program. I think we all know already that it is minimum funding. We all know already it is not enough. We all know already that we end up every winter having to provide additional emergency funding. So the last thing we want to do is essentially gut this program. 
So, again, I share part of the goal of this because indeed I will have an amendment that will talk about expanding Pell grant funding. But you do not take the funding from some of the poorest, most vulnerable families in America. 
I am speaking as a Senator from a cold-weather State, Minnesota, but I think the vast majority of my colleagues share this sentiment as well. So when we come back to this, there will be a pretty strong debate. I hope we will have an overwhelmingly strong vote in opposition to this amendment. 
I also want to say, Mr. President--I will say it very briefly--that I look forward to starting tomorrow. I do intend to introduce an amendment to expand funding for Head Start. I have been doing some really interesting traveling and learned so much from people when I was in eastern Kentucky. 
I, by the way, would like to say to the Chair, not in sort of a syrupy, senatorial courtesy, if you will, but at my wife's family reunion, the Isom family in eastern Kentucky, about half the people were from Indiana. I had an opportunity to tell them I really enjoyed working with Senator Coats from Indiana. It was kind of nice. Most of them are Republicans. I did not change their view, but they are wonderful people. They think a great deal of the Chair. I think they are disappointed he is in fact not going to be continuing in the Senate. I say that to the Chair. 
One of the things you learn, especially as you visit Head Start, is that now that we are talking more about the very early years, I mean the funding, when it comes to really trying to help with families where children are 1 or 2, under the age of 3, we have practically no funding at all. 
I tell you, I met some wonderful people in eastern Kentucky. One woman who has been with Head Start, I don't know, from the very beginning, her husband died of black lung, and she has not had a high school degree. With the help of Head Start, she went back and got her high school degree, went on and got a college education and has been a Head Start teacher for 30 years. I asked her, `Why do you do this? You can't get wealthy. You don't make very much money at all.' She talked about her love of children. You could just feel it. 
So I want to have an amendment that talks about expanding some funding for Head Start. I certainly want to have an amendment that deals with the Pell grant program. I will have one other amendment that will deal with this whole issue of what are we going to do about rebuilding crumbling schools. 
I heard my colleague, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, in a very eloquent way say there is agreement on this except we do not seem to match our words with resources. I am seeing, as I travel around the country, some of these crumbling schools. It is sort of like when we talk about family values. We have to make `values' a verb. It cannot just be a noun. We have to sort of live it, do it. 
If we value these children, we just cannot have children going to schools that are crumbling. You cannot have children walking into schools where the ceilings are falling--I have seen these conditions--or when the stench of urine is in the hallway or toilets are decrepit and you cannot even wash your hands after you go to the bathroom. 
As Senator Kennedy said earlier, we are saying to these kids --no matter what we think we are saying--what we are saying is that we do not value you much. We have to figure out a way as a nation to do something about this. 
I was at a gathering with a top urban educator. I so appreciated her remarks because what she said is: Look, you all can debate whether there should be tests or standards or how you measure accountability and all the rest of it, and it is all debatable, but, she said, some things are simple. Just invest some money in infrastructure. Help rebuild these crumbling schools. 
She is right. I will have another amendment that will deal with that. But I do hope when we come back--I want my colleague from Arizona to know there will be a very fierce debate about this. I mean, for the last several years I have come out here. Senator Kennedy has joined me. Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, a number of different Senators have been very strong on this. Senator Jeffords has been a very strong leader on this. And we have had to fight every year for this low-income energy assistance. I do not think we should have to fight so hard for it because it is really just a basic lifeline program. 
My colleague from Arizona, whether he intends to do so or not, is essentially gutting this program, ending it. We cannot do that. We cannot do that. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan, since my comments will be in disagreement, that I have tremendous respect for all the work that they have done. Both of them represent the very best of public service. But I can't, as a matter of principle, vote for this budget agreement. I support balancing the budget through a process which observes basic principles of economic and social justice and embodies the notion of shared sacrifice in pursuit of the common good, the common interest, the people's interest. But despite the cheers of its supporters, this deal fails miserably those tests. 
In the midst of all the cheering over this deal, we face a quiet crisis. It is not a war, it is not a broad economic calamity, but it is a crisis, nonetheless. This is, by the averages and the indicators, a prosperous time for our country. It is a time of sustained economic growth and low inflation, of a booming stock market and low unemployment. There is no blare of bugles, no moan of universal distress, no loud hordes of protesters clamoring in our streets. But averages are misleading. They tell nothing of the end of the curve, the height at the top or the depth at the bottom, and that is where our crisis resides. It is a quiet crisis of money, power, and injustice. It is the crisis of a nation in danger of abandoning the principles of equality and justice that are so fundamental to our resilience and to our future together. 
The principle of economic justice in this bill has been eclipsed. I fear it will accelerate growing inequalities in our country that we all should be committed to combat. We have moved in recent years back to a darker time. It is a more stratified America. It is really two Americas: one America with mounting access to the things that make life richer in possibility; the other caught in a constant struggle to make ends meet. 
One able to purchase the security of gated communities and private schools; the other beset by the dangers of a decaying social fabric. 
One America swiftly navigating the information superhighway, the other lacking the rudimentary skills needed to navigate an ever-more complex society. 
One enriched by a rising stock market; the other at the uncertain mercies of the job market. 
One wondering when to take a vacation to Europe or Asia; the other hoping to save enough to take a family to a ball game. 
This other America, this second America is not inhabited by just the poor or neglected minority. It is, in fact, the residence of the American majority. It is the homeland of most of our workers, most of our families, most of our children, and it is precisely this America that the budget agreement fails to serve fully and fairly. 
I would support a deal that required truly shared sacrifice while investing in our future, but shared sacrifice is not what this package is all about. Instead, it is about working families sacrificing and Wall Street investors and big companies garnering the lion's share of the benefits. 
Balancing the short-term budget fairly is a responsible and it is a worthwhile goal, made easier by our recent economic boom. But building a strong economy, preserving a shared prosperity, ensuring social and economic stability for the next generation by investing in their health and their skills and their character, our children, this is a far loftier and far more difficult goal for which we should have been striving in this budget agreement, and this agreement falls short of those goals. 
First, the agreement is unfair. At times, it is grossly unfair, I say to my colleagues, to the vast majority of working Americans who deserve real tax relief but will not get it in this bill, because most of the benefits go to the wealthiest 3 to 4 percent of the taxpayers and the profitable companies. 
Second, this agreement is shortsighted, starving our Nation's investment needs, investments critical to our future economic and social prosperity, in order to pay for large, unfair, and unwarranted tax cuts. 
Third, and perhaps most ironically, since its ostensible purpose is to balance the budget, it is fiscally irresponsible. By locking into place hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy, as far as the eye can see, many of which will grow larger and larger over time, it will cause the deficit to explode just as the baby boomers are expected to retire and begin to draw on programs like Social Security and Medicare. 
While this agreement has been hailed by some Democrats because it partially preserves funding for certain health care, education, and other programs that Republicans have been trying to slash for almost 3 years, and it is hailed by Republicans because it contains the huge tax cuts for the wealthy for which they have so long fought and sought, a closer look is called for in the midst of all this cheerleading. 
As a legislator, I have discovered that too often if the deal appears to give all things to all parties, as this one does, something is not quite right. 
Americans should take a closer look at the details of this package. When they do, they will be very troubled by what they see. Even with the marginal improvements which were forced by the President and the Democratic colleagues in the Congress, it still is a deeply flawed agreement which mortgages the economic futures of our children for the short-term political benefit which some will derive by claiming to have balanced the budget. 
Unless we revisit this deal soon, it will lock us into a program of huge tax cuts, mainly going to the wealthiest of people, funded by equally large spending cuts in virtually every single basic function of Government--environmental protection, airline safety, crime control, science and health and technology research, health care for the frail and the elderly and the poor. 
And, Mr. President, it will do so while continuing the Republican Congress tradition of stuffing more money into the Pentagon than even the Pentagon has requested, more B-2 bombers and ships and fighters than we need, mostly to preserve jobs in key congressional districts. 
As one of my colleagues observed, this bill sacrifices tomorrow's hopes for today's headlines. That is a mistake for which we will all pay for years to come, just as we did for the mistakes of the early 1980's and its exploding deficits. 
Mr. President, the President of the United States said, among other things, he would only sign on to a deal that was fair, fiscally responsible, with no exploding deficits in the next 10 years or so. These were the basic tests that he said he would apply to any final agreement. But this agreement clearly fails the fairness test. The sad fact is that low-income families get virtually nothing--nothing--from this tax cut bill, working families get very little, and the wealthy are the big winners in this tax bill. 
While the ink is barely dry on the deal--and so we do not have any official information about its actual distributional impact--we are asked to vote on this without getting any official information about who exactly is going to benefit and who is going to be asked to sacrifice. 
Preliminary analysis suggests a disastrously lopsided approach skewed to the very rich, those making over $200,000 a year annually. That is not the middle class in America. The nonpartisan group, Citizens for Tax Justice, has run the numbers through a fairly sophisticated distributional model. And they found that the tax package delivers about half of its benefits to the top 5 percent of the taxpayers. 
Half of the benefits go to the top 5 percent of the taxpayers. The average tax cut for middle-class working families and individuals, when you figure in all the tax hikes and cuts together, is about $200. For the richest 1 percent, it is about $16,000. I had hoped for substantial tax relief for working families. This bill only offers about one-fourth of its overall relief to those making under $100,000 a year. I think working families should not have to settle for scraps from the tax cut table. They should have been the first in line for relief. But that is not the case. 
But just a few examples. 
The alternative minimum tax was passed in 1986. With tax fairness, large companies ought to pay, large profitable companies ought to pay at least some tax. That has essentially been gutted. The Treasury Department estimates that these changes would take 76,000 profitable corporations completely off the tax rolls, and to the tune of $18 billion over the next 10 years. 
Another example. While this budget provides little or no relief for working families, it gives wealthy Americans huge capital gains tax cuts. The vast majority of these benefits from the cuts in capital gains go to big investors, people making $200,000, $300,000, and $400,000 annually. Hardly tax fairness. 
Mr. President, not only is this deal unfair, it is shortsighted, it ignores our most critical needs as a nation, including repairing and rebuilding our crumbling schools. Not one penny is invested in our crumbling schools, including dealing with our crumbling inner cities, our underdeveloped rural areas. 
Through its spending controls, it provides for huge and still unspecified cuts in Federal investments that my colleagues apparently do not like to talk about much, an estimated $272 billion in such nondefense cuts over the next 10 years while it claims to `protect' some priority programs. 
I am very skeptical. There is not a penny here for crumbling schools to secure educational opportunities for children. How come that was not a priority program? There is too little for job training for dislocated workers, for workers struggling to move off welfare into good jobs, and there is too little by way of reinvesting in our inner cities, the environmental protection, in basic key investments critical to our Nation's future. 
Mr. President, I voted against the spending bill. And I will vote against this tax bill. I do not understand how my colleagues can basically view these matters separately. They are part of one package and one deal. And I will just give some examples. 
We now have huge, significant cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. And they are being used to pay for the tax cuts in this deal, which disproportionately go to the top 1, 2, 3 percent of the population that need the assistance the least. That is part of the tradeoff. 
Mr. President, Medicare will be cut by $115 billion over the next 5 years. And the proposal assumes $385 billion in cuts over 10 years. In Medicaid, we will be cutting $13 billion over the next 5 years. 
Mr. President, in rural Minnesota, where the hospitals and the clinics are not greedy--a small profit margin--60, 70, 80 percent of the patient payment mix is Medicare and Medicaid. Please, do not have any illusions about this. The cuts to the providers will make it difficult for some of these hospitals and clinics to go on. When they no longer exist, that hurts our rural communities. 
Mr. President, the cuts in medical assistance disproportionately hurt our children's hospitals and disproportionately hurt our inner-city hospitals which are safety net hospitals for the poorest Americans--including children--in America. 
My colleagues say to me, `Well, but this overall agreement, it's not that bad, after all.' And I say, `Compared to what?' To the earlier Republican bills, which the huge majority of American people rejected, this is an improvement. We did not go forward with a $5 copay, even though it passed in the Senate, for elderly people for home health care visits. 
We have done better by way of graduate medical education. And, yes, Mr. President, we have $24 billion more in children's 
health care. And it includes also some additional parity, nondiscrimination for children and families struggling with mental illness. I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici. It is a labor of love to work with him on this. 
But, Mr. President, we still do not know at the State level how much of this will reach the children. We hope it does. There are 10 million children without coverage. I have seen projections anywhere from 1 1/2 million to 5 million will be covered, though it is block granted to the States. And we do not have the ironclad guarantees that we need. We need to fulfill our goal of providing adequate and complete care for all children in America. 
But, Mr. President, irony built upon ironies. My colleagues say it is not that bad, we are doing better for children. I give credit where credit is due. But last Congress we cut $25 billion in the major food nutrition program for children. It ultimately will be a 20-percent cut in food stamps, and about 70 percent of the recipients are children. Almost all of them are in working families, usually families with incomes under $7,000 a year. This directly affects the quality of their health care. I did not see any restoration of any funding for the major child nutrition program in the United States of America. 
Mr. President, my colleagues say we did better for legal immigrants. We restored some of the supplemental security income for those immigrants that have been in this country, but, Mr. President, we eliminated all of the food nutrition assistance. So if you have an elderly Hmong woman in Saint Paul, and she has $450 of SSI and another $75 in food stamps, and that is her total monthly income--and that is exactly the figure for many people --we did not restore any, we did not restore one penny of food nutrition assistance. It is not that bad but, Mr. President, this piece of legislation is also not that good. 
Mr. President, I do not understand exactly what the concept of justice is here. I do not know what happened to the principle of justice and fairness. Not only do we have the tax cuts going disproportionately to the top 5 percent of the population, but even when we say we are going to help children and families, we decide that we will do nothing for the poorest. 
The child tax credit is refundable. And now we say it is refundable to families with incomes over $100,000 a year. But if you are a family with an income of under $18,000 a year, you are not eligible at all. We decided that families with over $100,000 a year needed the assistance. But since we have the earned-income tax credits, we decided that families with incomes under $18,000 a year would not be eligible for a child credit at all. What kind of standard of justice is that? 
I spent a lot of time with those families. I see their struggles. Don't tell me that those families, families in America with incomes under $18,000 a year, could not also have benefited from the tax credit so they could have provided their children with a little bit more. Don't tell me they would not have benefited. What concept of justice justifies a tax credit for families with incomes over $100,000 a year, but zero, no assistance, for families earning under $18,000 a year? 
Mr. President, on higher education, we have seen a great deal of discussion. I find it difficult to say this, but I am going to because 20 years of my life was devoted to higher education. Some of this is a bit hyped. Some of it is a bit hyped. Some of it is a bit of hype. 
Mr. President, I am grateful for the tax deductions. I am grateful for the tax credits which are nonrefundable, but every single financial aid officer you want to talk to, everyone involved in financial aid will tell you we should have expanded the Pell grants. The statistic that is unconscionable is that a flat 8 percent, since 1979, of those families with incomes under $20,000 a year, only a flat 8 percent have been able to graduate, men and women from those families, with affordability being a key problem. There are other problems but that is the major problem. There is really nothing in this piece of legislation for them. 
We expanded the Pell grant by $300, but the Pell grant is now meeting at best about 16 percent of the student's overall need. We could have expanded the Pell grant program up to $5,000 a year. It would have reached middle income as well for the same price tag as to what we did here with the tax deduction and the tax credits. 
But, Mr. President, the tax credits are nonrefundable. The tax credits are not refundable. I will just tell you that if you spend any time at the community colleges, you will find that most of the students are older and going back to school, and they have incomes of around $25,000, $26,000 a year. They are ineligible because they do not have the tax liability. And we are making the claim that this is essentially 2 years more of free education? It does not hold up. It does not hold up. 
Mr. President, we say we protected priority programs. We have hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts, which will increase with every year, disproportionately going to the top 5 percent of the population, and altogether, Mr. President, we came up with not $5 billion that we were going to leverage for some investment in rebuilding crumbling schools, but we threw in $10 million at the end, $10 million for all of America. Mr. President, what kind of priorities are these? How could the administration have bargained this away? 
I was down in Delta City, MS, in Tunica, MS. I visited a school. This was an all-black school. The ceiling was kind of crumbling in. The toilets were decrepit. If you had wanted to wash your hands after going to the bathroom, you would not have been able to. 
But, Mr. President, I was in Chicago on Monday visiting with some of the housing projects, and I saw the same kind of schools. You look at these schools, they are so uninviting. They are crumbling. And we tell our children we put no value on them when we send children to such schools. 
The General Accounting Office tells us it costs $110 billion if we want to invest in rebuilding these crumbling schools. We have not invested anything in rebuilding crumbling schools--not really--just $10 million for the whole Nation. That is a joke, and it is a cruel joke. How can we say that we have protected our major priority programs when we don't invest anything in rebuilding crumbling schools in America? 
Mr. President, it is not just Chicago and Mississippi; it is North, East, South, and West. I say to my colleagues, if you say you are committed to education, we can have a debate about educational standards. Maybe they are good, maybe they are not. We can debate about how you measure academic performance. We can have all those debates. But this is simple: Don't send children to schools where the ceilings are falling in and the stench of urine is in the hallways and the buildings are decrepit and expect those children to do well. We say that this budget agreement protects our major priorities. What about these children? Aren't they our major priority? 
Mr. President, I was in Chicago on Monday in the Pilsen neighborhood with Congressmen Gutierrez and Bobby Rush at the Robert Taylor Home Housing Project. St. Augustine had a wonderful Head Start Program. It was a great program. I was inspired by their work. But, Mr. President, they could take 30-some children at the site we visited, and they have 335 children who want to participate--335 children who could be given a head start if we fully funded this program. 
Altogether we have added $324 million. We have 4 million children in the United States of America, from birth to age 5, who were not served by the Head Start Program, and we have invested a measly $324 million, which we claim--and it doesn't hold up under scrutiny--will lead to an additional 1 million children. Why don't we fully fund Head Start? If the program does what it says it does, which is to give children a head start, why give the tax benefits to the wealthiest of people and, at the same time, not the investment in rebuilding crumbling schools and not an investment in Head Start? Everywhere I go, all across the United States of America, whether it is rural or urban, I see the successes with kids, I see men and women who work with these children. They should be famous. They make too little money as Head Start teachers or as teacher assistants. We say these are the critical years, and we say the very early part of children's lives is the most critical time, and we invest $324 million, and that is it. 
Mr. President, many of my colleagues support this bill and they call it, on balance, a good piece of work. I simply cannot join them in their enthusiasm because I am too painfully aware of the people this bill leaves behind. Mr. President, the benefits are skewed toward America's very wealthy, and when working families find this out, they will not be pleased. 
Mr. President, this piece of legislation, this budget deal, leaves too many Americans behind. We can and we should balance the budget fairly and responsibly, observing the principle of shared sacrifice and economic justice, making the Tax Code fairer, simpler, and flatter in the process, and investing in our Nation's future. We could have done that because the economy is booming and it is much easier to do it now than a few years ago. But with this bill, Mr. President, we have failed in that effort at fairness. 
If this balanced budget agreement is to be the great accomplishment of 8 years of Democratic Presidency, then history will judge us harshly. With a budget that we already have, that is essentially in substantial balance because of the policies of the past 4 years, this agreement today is really a triumph of the past rather than a bridge to the century to come. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will ensure that battered women have increased access to affordable housing through tenant-based rental assistance. The lack of safe, affordable housing is a major factor in forcing women to return to their violent partners, either directly from a shelter or after attempting to set up an independent home. This bill would address that important problem by providing section 8 housing certificates to low-income women who are victims of domestic violence. 
Domestic violence in our society is a staggering problem. An estimated 4 million American women experience a serious assault by a husband or boyfriend each year. In 1993 alone, over 1,300 women were reportedly killed by abusive partners or former partners. Battered women are confronted with numerous obstacles in their efforts to survive and escape domestic violence. Some obstacles arise from the dynamics of abusive relationships--dependency, isolation, and fear. Economic obstacles, however, create some of the must difficult problems for women trying to leave a violent partner, including child and health care costs, and the lack of safe, affordable housing. Battered women and their children are a large proportion of the emergency shelter population. Even if shelter space is available, access to affordable housing, housing subsidies and services are needed to keep women from having to return to a violent home. A study in Michigan found that 60 percent of those who left shelters and returned to their violent partners did so because of too little affordable housing. Equally as disturbing is the fact that 50 percent of all homeless women and children in this country are fleeing domestic violence. 
There have been cases brought to my attention in my home State of Minnesota where women trying to escape abusive relations could have benefited from this legislation, and we know that sadly there are many more stories from around the country. 
One case involves a young mother from a small town in central Minnesota. Rachel left her child's father after suffering 2 years of abuse at his hands. She and her baby stayed in a battered women's shelter for a month until she found an apartment. After paying her rent each month, Rachel was unable to provide for her family. Seeing no other options, she returned to the home of her abuser; after a 2 month respite, he began to batter her again. 
This legislation would assist women, like Rachel, fleeing abuse to get affordable housing by authorizing $50 million in funding for section 8 housing certificates. The Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] would allocate the resources to public housing authorities which would issue the housing certificates to domestic violence victims. Only those victims who met the other requirements of the section 8 program would be eligible. HUD estimates that this program would provide 7,500 housing units nationwide for victims of domestic violence. 
Mr. President, this legislation will go a long way in removing a major road-block for battered women who are trying to escape domestic violence--the lack of affordable housing. We need to give these women an opportunity other than living on the streets, in shelters, returning to their batterers. This legislation would provide battered women and their children an opportunity to rebuild their lives in a stable home. Furthermore, this legislation conveys the message to abusers that we will not tolerate their violence, that we will not continue to allow them to drive their victims into the shelters and the street.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will provide safe havens for children who are members of families in which violence is a problem. I am pleased to have my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, join me in this effort. 
The prevalence of family violence in our society is staggering. Studies show that 25 percent of all violence occurs among people who are related to one another. Data also indicate that the incidence of violence in families escalates during separation and divorce. In fact, over 70 percent of women who are treated for domestic violence in emergency departments have already separated from the person who has inflicted their injuries. Many of these assaults occur in the context of child visitation. This clearly places children at risk not only of witnessing violence, but also of becoming victims of violence within their own families. Children who are exposed to violence suffer many long term effects of this exposure. 
In addition to the obvious physical consequences of violence, there are innumerable psychosocial effects. For example, a child who learns from his parents, his role models, that violence is a way of resolving differences, or controlling another person, will grow up believing that it is normal to use violence in everyday interpersonal relationships. As a consequence, he will grow up believing that it is acceptable to physically hurt those people he loves the most. A young girl who watches her mother being beaten up by her father may come to understand that physical injury is just one aspect of a `normal" relationship. Children who are exposed to violence are at risk for mental health problems and substance abuse problems as they grow up. When we allow children to grow up believing that violence is normal and acceptable, we do a great deal of damage to their lives and decrease their chances for healthy futures. 
In order to prevent the risk of exposure to violence, I am introducing this legislation, to provide funding for the creation of child safety centers. These centers will provide a safe environment in which children can visit with their parents without risk of being exposed to violence in the context of their family relationships. This bill will protect children from the trauma of witnessing or experiencing violence, sexual abuse, neglect, abduction, rape, or death during parent-child visitation or visitation exchanges; protect victims of violence from experiencing further violence during child visitation or visitation exchanges and will provide safe havens for children and their parents during visitation or visitation exchanges. 
This act will provide grants to States to enable the states to enter into contract and cooperative agreements with public or private nonprofit entities in order to establish child safety centers. These centers will operate for the purpose of facilitating supervised visitation and visitation exchange. The services provided by the centers will be evaluated each year, so that we will learn how many people are served by the centers and what types of problems are encountered by the clients of the centers. The act will authorize appropriations of $65,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2000. 
Mr. President, this legislation will go a long way in protecting children from family violence and in providing support for families that are experiencing violence. We need to do this to protect our children and give them the chance to grow up without believing that violence is normal.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just a few thoughts about the budget agreement. There is still a lot of drafting going on, so to a certain extent I think all of us are at a little bit of a disadvantage in that we have not seen all of the specifics, but I would like to raise a couple of questions about this agreement, and I raise these questions given what I think is the important standard of fairness. 
First of all, I hope that all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, will have before them the distributional data, that is to say some understanding as to who will benefit from these tax cuts, before we are asked to vote on the tax-cut part of this bill. It seems to me this is kind of a prerequisite for good public policy. I remain very skeptical that, indeed, these tax cuts, when you look at who is really going to benefit with each passing year, will not disproportionately go to those people who are least in need of any assistance. At the same time, I see a tradeoff that seems quite unacceptable. Every single time it looks like low-income and moderate-income families get the short end of the stick. I think we should set the bar at a higher level, and I think those families should count. Let me just give but a couple of examples. 
Mr. President, the child credit, we are now hearing from the White House, will go to families with incomes under $30,000 a year or under $28,000 a year, the argument being that, indeed, these families pay Social Security taxes and they should receive a child credit as well as those families with incomes over $30,000 a year. But, as it turns out, families with incomes under $16,000 a year are not going to receive any child care credit. I have had a chance to travel some around the country and visit with poor children, visit with low-income families. I don't understand how in the world we could be talking about fairness if, in fact, those families are not going to receive any of the child care credits, those families most in need. 
Another example is on the higher education piece. I have said this over and over again, and I hope I am wrong, but I don't think I am. I was a teacher for 20 years. I spent a lot of time at the community colleges. Mr. President, if the tax credits are not refundable, then those students or those families with incomes under $28,000 a year or $27,000 a year, that are not going to have any tax liability, they are not going to receive any of the assistance. So when it comes to those students who have been least able to afford higher education, they are still going to be waiting for some of this assistance. 
Add to that some of the concerns that I think all of us have to have about the cuts or reductions in payment in Medicare and medical assistance, in particular those of us--and I come from such a State--where we have strong rural communities. We have to worry about the negative impact this is going to have on rural health care providers. If we don't have hospitals or clinics, then we are not able to deliver the care out in our communities. We have to have concerns about the disproportionate effect this is going to have on our children's hospitals and public hospitals that have received a disproportionate amount of medical assistance because they serve a disproportionate number of low-income and moderate-income people. 
So, the question really becomes: Where is the standard of fairness if the tax cuts still, in the main, go to the very top of the economic population and at the same time the benefits don't go to many, many hard-pressed families? We have not invested, in this budget agreement, one penny in rebuilding crumbling schools. As it turns out, families with incomes under $16,000, with children, receive no help by way of the child credit. Those students from families with incomes $23,000, $24,000, $25,000 a year are not going to benefit from the Hope scholarship unless it's a refundable tax credit. We are not investing in the schools, and at the same time we don't even have the distributional data on who exactly is going to benefit from these tax cuts. 
So I count myself as a skeptical Senator. And if I was going to be voting today, I would vote against this package. I do not think it meets the Minnesota standard of fairness. I think we should do better. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand that this amendment will be accepted. I am very pleased. I think there is strong bipartisan support for it. We worked very hard to make sure it was kept in conference. 
I would like to thank Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg for their support, and Senator Torricelli who is out here on the floor. 
Mr. President, let me briefly summarize this amendment. This amendment essentially ensures that no one who is a victim of domestic violence will be denied legal representation because of the economic status of her or his abuser. 
Mr. President, I am saddened to have to really on the floor of the Senate make the point that what we have right now in the country is something close--it is a staggering problem. We have an estimated 4 million American women who experience a serious assault by a husband or boyfriend each year. In 1993 alone, over 1,300 women were reportedly killed by abusive partners or former partners. 
I want to make it clear that Legal Services has done a wonderful job. They have handled over 250,000 cases involving domestic violence; 50,000 of those cases involved clients seeking protection from abusive spouses. 
The problem is that all too often those on the receiving end of grants in some cases--I know in Minnesota this happens--they really do everything they can and extend the rules or figure out ways of providing legal representation. Most of the time it is for a woman. But sometimes what happens in other situations is they don't because it is a horrible catch-22 situation where the income of the husband or assets of the husband which are the assets of the household makes this woman who has been abused and beaten up ineligible for any legal representation. By the same token, she can't afford to have legal representation on her own, in which case she is without protection. This is critically important. I actually don't think that this is an exaggeration to say that this quite often is a life or death situation. 
So when we are talking about obtaining orders of protection, child support, and other kinds of protection, this is critically important. 
I again thank both of my colleagues for their support of this amendment. I want to thank Senator Torricelli who has been very active and a real leader in this area for his support. 
This is an important clarification. One more time, and I will finish. 
The legal services community in the country is doing the very best job. But, if we had a debate, I would have brought out to the floor many examples--very telling examples--of women who have not been able to receive the protection. Legal Services lawyers want to provide it but are not at all clear that they can because of the income of the husband and sometimes the income of a wife. This is a tragedy. 
This is a huge step forward. It is a very significant amendment. I thank both of my colleagues for their support.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I can be very brief on this. This is really just a study. 
Basically, what this amendment asks is that as we go forward with the welfare bill and it is implemented in States around the country, the Legal Services Corporation compile data on what kinds of appeals might be made by women and their families dealing with the welfare law as it is implemented. 
It is simply a study to document numbers of people who come to them with a variety of different grievances so that we get a clear record of what is happening. Right now, in many cases, these lawyers are not able to take up these cases. 
This does not mandate anything. It just simply calls for a study. 
I thank my colleagues for their support.

Mr. WELLSTONE. As to this amendment, I think what we want to make sure of, whatever differences we have about the welfare bill, what I think is a kind of bipartisan consensus is that it work well as it gets implemented at the State level. And so whether it is food-nutrition programs or whether it is a mother trying to find child care or whether someone who is in a job training program and trying to stay in that program or whether it is an issue of public transportation, we want to make sure that all of our citizens, even if they are poor, even if they are women and children, have legal representation and that the due process rights are maintained. I think this study will give us a clearer picture as to where we are in relation to these issues. 
I thank both my colleagues. 
Mr. President, I would also like to thank them for their patience. I was at Justice Brennan's service and that is why I was a little late in getting back.

Mr. WELLSTONE. This situation is extremely unfair--owners of other ethanol production facilities are able to take advantage of this incentive, yet we are denying family farmers their fair share of the benefit. While I strongly support the preservation and extension of the ethanol tax incentives--vital for this maturing industry--passthrough of the small producer credit is a separate issue of fundamental fairness for family farmers. 
I believe all Members can agree that family farmers, who have made a substantial investment in ethanol production, should be able to take advantage of the same tax benefits that other small business owners who produce ethanol now enjoy. Passthrough of this tax credit is not a corporate subsidy and does not benefit large corporations, but is an incentive for America's family farmers to help produce a fuel that decreases our foreign oil dependence, spurs rural development, and improves our Nation's air quality.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I offered this amendment last night. We had a fairly thorough discussion. I don't think this is an adversarial relationship with my colleague from Mississippi. 
Let me just briefly summarize. 
This amendment revives what is called the Outreach and Start Up Grant Program for school breakfasts. Let me point out to my colleagues what this is about. 
This is a Children's Defense Fund poster. `Remember these hungry kids in China? Now they are in Omaha.' They could be in any of our States. 
We have 5.5 million American children who do not regularly get enough to eat. There was a $5 million outreach program that we eliminated last year in the welfare bill. I don't think colleagues knew what they were voting on. They did when it came to the overall welfare bill. But this was one tiny provision. 
The argument that was made about this outreach program was 
that it was too successful. That is to say, we have 8 million children who could qualify for the School Breakfast Program but don't receive it because many school districts and States aren't yet able to set it up. 
This $5 million outreach program made a huge difference. It was very successful, and, indeed, the School Breakfast Program is credited as being one of the most successful nutritional programs in our country. 
I fear that too many of my colleagues do not understand that there are children in our country who go to school hungry, and we are not doing very much about it. When children go to school hungry, they don't do well in school, and when they don't do well in school they can't learn, and when they are adults later on they can't earn. 
It is very shortsighted that we eliminated this program. We should not have done so. 
Mr. President, there are 8 million children spread across 27,000 schools who go to school hungry or are malnourished or without enough to eat. The distinctions aren't that important. We can do better. 
For $5 million we can have an outreach program that will enable more of our States and more of our school districts to provide a school breakfast, a nutritious meal, to children before they start school. 
Mr. President, again this is an extremely effective program. Study after study has really pointed out that the School Breakfast Program makes an enormous difference. It makes an enormous difference in terms of overall test scores. It makes an enormous difference in terms of whether students drop out of school or not, whether they arrive at school on time, and how well they do. 
Clearly this amendment speaks to priorities. Surely we can find $5 million. 
Mr. President, the offset is from funds allocated to the crop insurance companies for which right now the total amount is $202 million. In the Senate we have $24 million more than the House appropriated. We have $52 million more than the President appropriated. 
The GAO in a very critical report of this insurance program pointed out that there is $81 million more than the companies' expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance. 
I am very careful to maintain the integrity of this program--a mere $5 million transfer, $5 million out of $24 million more than the House allocated, $5 million out of $52 million we have more than the President asked for, which could go to an outreach program for school breakfast. 
I make this appeal to colleagues. There are too many children in our country who are malnourished. There are too many children who cannot learn. There are too many children who have rotting teeth because they don't get the decent meals that they deserve and the adequate meal that they deserve and the nutrition that they deserve. There are too many children who aren't able to concentrate in school. There are too many children who suffer from health care problems because they don't have an adequate diet. 
We never should have done that. We never should have done this. We eliminated the most successful outreach program--total cost for the whole Nation, $5 million. 
Surely it is not asking too much of my colleagues to allocate a transfer of this small amount of money to make sure that we provide children with an adequate breakfast, with a decent meal, so that they can start school on the right foot and do well. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am sorry it is late tonight. I am going to have a chance to summarize this amendment for colleagues tomorrow. Let me just start out with a poster from the Children's Defense Fund: `Remember Those Hungry Kids In China? Now They Are In Omaha.' But it could be in any of our States. Currently there are an estimated 5.5 million American kids who don't eat regularly. They don't get enough to eat. 
Mr. President, we have to do better. I offer an amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill which would revive the outreach and startup grants program for school breakfasts. They are called outreach grants. It may come as a shock to some of the Members of this body that children, too many children, are going to school hungry and we are not doing anything about it. Let me repeat that. I have brought this amendment to the floor of the Senate before. I now have an amendment on the agriculture appropriations bill. I hope I will win on this amendment. I appeal to my colleagues to please support this amendment, but I will come back with this amendment over and over and over again, until I restore the funding. 
This program was eliminated. Let me just repeat what is going on here. There are too many children who go to school who are hungry. We are not doing anything about it. There are too many children who go to school with rotting teeth from non-nutritious foods. There are too many children who go to school with aching, empty stomachs. There are too many children who go to school who are unable to learn because they are malnourished and hungry. And that is not the goodness in our country. 
Mr. President, the welfare law of 1996 eliminated--eliminated the school breakfast outreach and startup grants. They were created in 1990 and they were made permanent in 1994. What these outreach grants are all about--and we are talking about $5 million and only $5 million to reestablish this program--these were grants that enabled States and school districts to set up school breakfast programs. Some 45 States have received these funds. Every student who is eligible for a free lunch is eligible for school breakfast as well. However, only about 40 percent of those who are hungry, those who come from very low-income families and are eligible for school lunch program, are able to participate in the school breakfast program as well. 
This program, this outreach program which was combined with the public awareness program by the Food Research and Action Committee--and thank God we have FRAC, because they do wonderful work, and other nutrition advocacy groups--was a catalyst. We were able, through this outreach program, to expand the school breakfast program by 26,000 schools to an additional 2.3 million poor children between 1987 and 1994. 
I would like my colleagues to listen carefully to this, not only tonight, many are gone but staffs are around, but also tomorrow when I summarize. This program was extremely successful. It was eliminated because of the almost Orwellian argument that the $5 million outreach program should be eliminated because it was effective, because it was providing States and school districts with the information they needed to set up a school breakfast program to help hungry, malnourished children. 
I need to repeat that argument. This was completely eliminated. We eliminated an outreach program for poor children in America to make sure that they were able to participate in the school breakfast program because the argument was made it was encouraging school districts to set up school breakfast programs and therefore the Federal Government would have to contribute some money. 
Yes, we would. And that would be a good thing. Because today there are 14.3 million children who receive free and reduced-price lunches, but 8 million of them, spread across 27,000 schools, go to school hungry and receive no school breakfasts at all. Mr. President, 8 million children who need the help, 8 million children who could be starting out the day with a nutritious breakfast, do not receive that assistance, in part because we eliminated a $5 million outreach grant program. We eliminated the whole program. My colleagues know that hungry children cannot learn. And they know that if they cannot learn, when they are adults they won't be able to earn. I could not think of anything that is more shortsighted. 
Let me just repeat, talking about children and the importance of an equal chance for every child, too many children in our country, 8 million children--maybe more, maybe a few less, what difference does it make?--go to school and there is no school breakfast program. They are eligible. We eliminated the outreach program that would give States and school districts additional information so they could help hungry children, and as a result of that there are too many children who don't do well in school. 
Let me go with the next chart, although I will hold this up tomorrow. I would like my colleagues to see this. There are hungry kids in our country, an estimated 5.5 million American kids don't regularly get enough to eat. That is the Food 
Research in Action Coalition report, that is the Children's Defense Fund, this comes from the work of Tufts University. I mean, the evidence is there, colleagues. We have too many children who are malnourished. We have too many children that do not have an adequate diet. And we eliminate a $5 million program, an outreach program, because we said it was too effective. 
This chart points out the percentage of children from hungry and nonhungry households, and how it relates to health-related problems. Let me point out, the red is percent of nonhungry children, the green is percent of hungry children. Whether you are looking at unwanted weight loss, or fatigue, or frequent colds, or inability to concentrate, or ear infection, dizziness, asthma, allergies, diarrhea, irritability, frequent headaches--over and over and over again--this is from the Food Research Action Council, 1995--it is dramatic: The much larger percentage of children who are hungry children experience all of these specific health related problems. 
It is not too much, I say to my colleague from Mississippi, this is not too much to ask for. I don't think, when we voted on the welfare bill, the debate was really on this one $5 million outreach program. It was just one program in a large bill that we eliminated and we should not have. We set it up in 1990. It was very effective between 1990 and 1994; 1995, it was an excellent program, it was a program that provided outreach to 45 States. It meant that some additional school districts knew how to set up a school breakfast program. And, yes, we ended up providing some funding for that. But we should. Where there are children in need, where there are children who could really be helped by a program that would give them a nutritious meal, would give them a nutritious breakfast, we ought to make sure that happens. Otherwise these children don't do as well in school. 
I would just say to my colleagues, this is really all about our national vow of equal opportunity for every child. How can anybody here in the U.S. Senate say that we truly have equal opportunity for every single child when we have over 5 million children that do not get enough to eat and we don't even allocate $5 million for an outreach program that would help those children start out the day with a nutritious breakfast? This is wrong. I am just sure of it. This is wrong. We have to be able to do this. 
I just want to say, because my colleague is on the floor, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, that the Ag Appropriations Subcommittee did not cut this program at all. They didn't eliminate this program. This happened in the overall welfare bill. This was not action of the Appropriations Committee. 
I also want to say that Senator Cochran has been an advocate for children's nutrition programs. So let me be crystal clear, this is not aimed at some action taken by the Ag Appropriations Committee. But, Mr. President, what we did in the last Congress was profoundly mistaken. 
Let me just read for a moment--and there are many different studies I could read from--from the Tufts study. This really went back to 1987, in which Meyer Sampson, et al, examined the effect of the School Breakfast Program on school performance of low-income students in Lawrence, MA. 
In any case, what they found out is that from standardized tests to lateness and absences, over and over again, children who participated in the School Breakfast Program were shown to do much better on achievement tests, were shown to get to school on time, were shown to not be absent from school so often. 
It is just so clear. Can't we come up with $5 million? Now we have a doctor, Dr. Frist, who is presiding. This is a medical issue. I am just saying to Dr. Frist that we have a study here from the Food Research Action Council which points out the correlation between children who are malnourished and some of the health problems--unwanted weight loss, fatigue, frequent colds, inability to concentrate, ear infection, dizziness. 
I am saying I don't think any of us realize that in the welfare bill, we eliminated a $5 million--that is all it is--outreach program that was very effective. It was in operation in 45 States, and for the $5 million investment, we help provide school districts with information about how they can set up a school breakfast program. 
I am pointing out that there are some 8 million children who are eligible for the School Breakfast Program who don't receive any help, and there are too many children who go to school and don't get a nutritious meal. For $5 million, I say to my colleagues, we could have this outreach program. We never should have eliminated it. We know that when children are hungry, they don't do as well in school. The evidence is irrefutable and irreducible. We know that when children are malnourished and hungry that they don't have the same opportunities as our children do to do well in school. And we know that there is, as reported by the Tufts study, as reported by some of the work of the Food Research Action Council, and I have here about--if I had wanted to, I could have taken several hours to go over this amendment--a variety of different studies that have been done, and over and over and over again, it is the same. This is the Tufts University School of Nutrition, I say to the Presiding Officer, `The Link Between Nutrition and Cognitive Development in Children.' 
Look, if we have children in our country--and the evidence is clear--who go to school and, because their parents are so poor or for other reasons, and they are eligible because they are from low-income families, they don't get that nutritious breakfast, and we know there is a link between nutrition and cognitive development, we know there is a link in early years, we know there is a link in terms of how children do in school, why in the world would we have eliminated an outreach program? That is what we did. 
I will tomorrow, in summarizing this amendment, talk about what the offset will be, but I want to be real clear to everybody who is listening tonight--and I will do my very best to talk about this tomorrow again--that it may come as a shock, but the fact of the matter is, there are too many children who are going to school hungry, and we are not doing what we could do to help those children. 
It is a fact that there are too many children who go to school with rotting teeth from non-nutritious foods, and we could allocate $5 million for an outreach program which, as I pointed out, multiplies itself over and over and over again, and, in fact, has made a huge difference for some 2.3 million children. 
It is a fact that too many children are going to school with aching, empty stomachs, and we are not doing all that we can do to help those children. 
It is a fact that there are too many children who, because they do not start out the day with a decent meal, are not able to learn, and I will say it one more time, they are not able to learn, and because they are not able to learn, when they are adults, they are not able to earn. 
How shortsighted can it be to not be willing--we had a $270 billion Pentagon budget. We have all sorts of subsidies that go to oil companies, to pharmaceutical companies, to big insurance companies. We find all sorts of places and areas to spend money, and this $5 million outreach program was eliminated. 
Mr. President, maybe some people who are watching tonight will have a chance to speak on the floor about something I think is important tomorrow morning. I will have a chance to summarize this amendment. But one more time, I hope that we will restore this. I could read study after study after study, but I don't think I need to; I really don't think I need to. It is just crystal clear: We never should have eliminated a $5 
million outreach program that actually led to some 2.2 million more children having the chance to participate in the School Breakfast Program, because this outreach program gave school districts and gave States the information they needed to set up the School Breakfast Program. 
Then in the welfare bill, this outreach program was eliminated because the curious argument was made that it was too successful and too many school districts were setting up the School Breakfast Program and, God forbid, we were going to have to spend more money on child nutrition. That is the argument that was made, not by this committee, but the Ag Committee has jurisdiction over nutrition programs. 
I say to my colleague from Mississippi, this is an opportunity for us to do something in a bipartisan way that would really make a difference. This would be a good thing to do. This would be a right thing to do. This would be a small thing to do, but it would have a really large impact. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time to see whether or not there might be some reaction to my amendment.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague, who is always gracious. I think that is one of the reasons he is held in such high regard. 
I just point out again that we can have a discussion tomorrow morning or negotiation. And look, from my point of view, you know, I am sometimes grateful for small victories. And if there was a way that this amendment would be accepted, I would be very pleased. Then I would have to fight hard to keep it in the conference committee. 
Mr. President, I think that my colleague from Mississippi is absolutely correct in his analysis of what happened by way of going after this outreach grant program for school breakfasts with the argument being, `Here are the caps and here is what we have got to do to save the money.' If you want to, call me naive, but I just would like to say that this is a very brutal argument, not by my colleague from Mississippi, but this is a brutal argument that people are making. `We have got caps. We have got to save the money. Therefore, we eliminate a $5 million outreach program because it has led--that is why we have to eliminate it--it will lead to more school districts setting up a school breakfast program, and, therefore, more children who are in fact malnourished or hungry will be able to get at school a nutritious breakfast.' That is a brutal argument. 
Why in the world are we willing to make these kinds of cuts that target these children when we know darn well that the medical evidence and the educational evidence is so clear that it can make a huge difference whether or not a poor child has a decent breakfast and can start out the schoolday with a decent breakfast? 
What do you think the price is that we pay in children that could do well in school, that don't, that drop out? What do you think the price is that we pay for kids that get into trouble with substance abuse, that get into trouble with the law, that there is a higher correlation between high school dropouts and incarceration than cigarette smoking and lung cancer? What is the price we pay for kids dropping out? 
Now, an adequate breakfast for a poor child does not, ipso facto, guarantee that child will do well. But why in the world did we eliminate this outreach program? And why can't we restore it? 
Mr. President, I am really hoping that tomorrow we will be able to get support for this one. The Tufts University--I believe the Chair knows the Tufts University does some pretty good work, especially when it comes to issues with children and malnutrition. 
Current scientific research links nutrition and cognitive development. 
Undernutrition along with environmental factors associated with poverty can permanently retard physical growth, brain 
development, and cognitive functioning. 
The longer a child's nutritional, emotional, and education needs go unmet, the greater the likelihood of cognitive impairments. 
Iron deficiency anemia, affecting nearly 25 percent of poor children in the United States, is associated with impaired cognitive development. Iron deficiency anemia, which affects 25 percent of poor children in the United States, is associated with impaired cognitive development, and we cannot find $5 million for an outreach program, for a school breakfast program for malnourished children? 
Poor children who attend school hungry perform significantly below nonhungry low-income peers on standardized test scores. 
There is a study--I am a social scientist. They had an experimental group and control group, and they found out--they took children from the same income category--and they found that those children who attended school not hungry did much better on standardized tests than those children who attended school hungry. 
Is anybody here surprised by that finding? Isn't that clear? Those children from poor families who go to school and receive a good breakfast will do better in school, will do better on standardized tests. Does anybody want to argue with that? Well, if you don't, then how can you eliminate an outreach program that makes sure that those children are able to get that healthy breakfast? 
So, Mr. President, we will have more debate on this tomorrow. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Mississippi. I really hope that there will be support for this amendment, that we can find the small amount of money which would make such a huge difference. 
In any case, this is one of those amendments I just am going to keep bringing out on the floor because I know that we did the wrong thing. I know that. I think I can argue that. Since I believe in the goodness of people and I believe in the goodness of the Senate, I think there has just got to be a way that we can restore this program because it is not a program; it is kids, it is children. And we can help them. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Mikulski. 
First of all, I rise on the floor of the Senate to commend the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD and Independent Agencies for restoring $273 million in cuts in veterans discretionary programs, and to include health care for fiscal year 1998. 
Above and beyond this, let me also commend the committee for adding an additional $92.9 million above the President's budget request. This is a victory for veterans and their families, and it is a step in the right direction. 
We have been fighting to restore these cuts for 1998. When we first found out that in the budget resolution there were proposed cuts over the next 5 years, we held a forum out in Minnesota and, really, the veterans community was unanimous in denouncing these cuts. We circulated a letter, signed by colleagues, to the appropriations subcommittee. We have some appropriators here who are clearly strong advocates for veterans, and I thank them. 
We offered an amendment to the DOD authorization to transfer excess funding from the Pentagon to VA health care. We did not win on that amendment, but I thank the PVA, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the DAV, Disabled Veterans of America, and, in addition, I would also like to thank the Vietnam Veterans of America for their support. 
Now, what we have in this appropriations bill is a restoration of the $273 million, and adding another $92 million. That is good news for veterans and their families. Again, I commend my colleagues, and I thank DAV and PVA and Vietnam Vets and the other organizations for helping me and helping other Senators in restoring this funding. 
However, I remain deeply concerned about cuts in funding for veterans discretionary programs, health care programs, in the outyears, 1999 through 2002, which were agreed to in the bipartisan budget deal. So what this amendment essentially says to veterans is: Don't worry, because we go on record that your health care will be secure going into the next century. 
This amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which says that the Senate ensures its promises for veterans. It promises veterans that over the next 4 years, 1999 to 2002, the veterans' medical system will receive the resources it requires--I put that in bold letters--to deliver quality health care to our Nation's veterans. As I think about this budget deal, if we do not at least have a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, then we are talking about, in the outyears, cuts of about $2 billion from the President's request; or, another way of looking at it, it would be close to $3 billion from 1997 funding levels. 
It is wrong. We know it. This amendment I have introduced for myself and Senator Mikulski puts the Senate on record as saying these cuts are wrong and making it clear we go on record that we will provide the VA health care system with the resources it needs to provide as good care as possible--quality care, we hope and pray--for veterans, going into the 21st century.

The first is that within 30 days after enactment of this act, we get a CBO study that would provide to the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Senate Appropriations Committee an estimate of the cost of the provision in this amendment. The second part is that not later than 60 days after enactment of this bill, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs shall hold one or more hearings to consider legislation that would add the following diseases, which would now be presumptive, from the point of view of coverage: lung cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, posterior subcapsular cataracts, nonmalignant thyroid nodular disease, ovarian cancer, parathyroid adenoma, tumors of the brain and central nervous system, and rectal cancer.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment that will aid atomic veterans--veterans who were exposed to ionizing radiation while serving on active duty. Atomic veterans who may well be America's most neglected veterans. They have been seeking justice for as long as 50 years and I am determined to help them, and I think my colleagues are determined to help them. 
Mr. President, I want to dedicate this amendment to the brave and patriotic Minnesotans who served in the U.S. Army's 216th Chemical Service Company, participating in Operation Tumbler Snapper--a series of eight nuclear weapons tests that took place in the Nevada desert in 1952. In particular, I want to pay tribute to two former members of the Forgotten 216th, Smoky Parrish and Gene Toronto, patriotic Americans who have been my mentors and have fought hard to fair and just treatment for all atomic veterans. 
I want to say to them and their families and to other families's of atomic veterans that I will do all in my power as a U.S. Senator to ensure the Forgotten 216th and other veterans like them are never forgotten again. 
Before I discuss the substance of my amendment I would like to tell my colleagues more about the Forgotten 216th because their problems typify the problems of atomic veterans nationwide. When they participated in Operation Tumbler Snapper, they believed their Government's assurances that it would protect them against any harm, but have since become convinced they were used as guinea pigs without any concern for their safety. My colleague from Maryland said to me earlier, and I hope it's OK to repeat this, in a sense it was like the Tuskegee experiment. 
Immediately after a nuclear bomb blast, many were sent to measure fallout at or near ground zero, exposing them to so much radiation that their Geiger counters went off the scale while they inhaled and ingested radioactive particles. Members of the 216th were given minimal protection, sometimes even lacking film badges to measure radiation exposure and provided with no information on the perils they faced. Furthermore, they were sworn to secrecy about their participation in nuclear tests, sometimes denied access to their own service medical records, and provided no medical followup to ensure they'd suffered no ill effects as a result of their exposure to radiation. This happened in our country. Sadly, many members of the 216th have already died, often of cancer. Is it any wonder that these men now refer to themselves as the Forgotten 216th? 
Mr. President, my amendment is intended to address some of the recommendations of the `Final Report of the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments' issued in October 1995. I had an opportunity to testify before this committee about the atomic vets. 
The report's recommendations mirrored the concerns atomic veterans have had for many years: the list of presumptive diseases contained in law is incomplete and inadequate; the standard of proof for those without presumptive disease is impossible to meet; and these statutes are limited and inequitable in their coverage. 
The VA now maintains two lists of radiogenic diseases, a presumptive list established under Public Law 101-321 as amended by Public Law 102-578 and now consisting of 15 radiogenic diseases, and a nonpresmuptive list established under Public Law 98-542 which includes 11 diseases not on the presumptive list. My amendment would add these 11 diseases to the presumptive list, would result in the elimination of the nonpresumptive list, and the creation of a single presumptive list of radiogenic diseases. The radiogeneic diseases that would be added to the presumptive list are: lung cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, posterior subcapsular cataracts, non-malignant thyroid nodular disease, ovarian cancer, parathyroid adenoma, tumors of the brain and central nervous system, and rectal cancer. 
These veterans were exposed to this radiation. They went to ground zero. They were put in harm's way by our Government. They were never told that anything terrible would happen to them. But so many of them have had cancer, so many of their children and grandchildren have been born with a variety of different disorders and problems, the least we can do, the least we can do is make sure that they receive good care and adequate compensation. 
Why the need for these changes? To begin with veterans must jump through hoops to demonstrate they are eligible for compensation for nonpresumptive diseases and, after they have done so the chances that the VA will approve their claims are minuscule. 
Mr. President, to illustrate what I mean, permit me to cite some VA statistics. As of April 1, 1996, out of the hundreds of thousands of atomic veterans there have been a total of 18,515 radiation claim cases, with service-connection granted in 1,886 cases. According to VA statistics current as of December 1, 1995, only 463 involve the granting of presumptive service-connection. Thus, if we were to exclude the 463 veterans who were granted presumptive service-connection, atomic veterans had an incredibly low claims approval rate of less than 8 percent. Moreover, of this low percentage, an indeterminate percentage may have had their claims granted for diseases unrelated to radiation exposure. 
Why the abysmally low percentage of claims approvals? One key reason is that VA regulations are overly stringent for service-connection for nonpresumptive radiogenic diseases. Dose requirements pose a particularly difficult, if not insuperable hurdle. While it is almost impossible to come up with accurate dose reconstructions because decades have elapsed since the nuclear detonations and adequate records don't exist, veterans are frequently denied compensation because their radiation exposure levels are allegedly too low. In this connection, let me quote from the findings of the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments: `The Government did not create or maintain adequate records regarding the exposure of all participants in [nuclear weapons tests and] the identify and test locales of all participants.' This finding obviously calls into question the capability of the Government to come up with accurate dose reconstructions on which approval of claims for VA compensation for atomic veterans frequently depend. 
My amendment essentially says two things. First of all, what we are saying now is that we call on CBO to do this study and provide us with an estimate of the costs of this provision, and that is done within 30 days. And then, not later than 60 days after enactment of this act, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs is to hold one or more hearings to consider this legislation. 
Mr. President, my amendment will ensure that the VA fulfills its responsibility to give atomic veterans the benefit of the doubt in considering their claims for compensation. This is especially important because after more than 50 years there is still much about the effects of low-level radiation that is the subject of scientific controversy. 
As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I've fought hard to enable Persian Gulf veterans to receive compensation for diseases that may be linked to their service in the Persian Gulf, at least until scientists reach a definitive conclusion about the etiology of their illnesses. I've also strongly and consistently supported former Secretary Jesse Brown's efforts to ensure that Vietnam veterans are compensated for disabilities linked to their exposure to agent orange, even though science is still unable to determine the extent of their exposure. There is no question in my mind that both Persian Gulf and Vietnam veterans deserve such compensation. At the same time, I believe that the U.S. Government must give atomic veterans the same benefit of the doubt. 
Unfortunately, right now, this is not the case. 
Let me give one example of the discriminatory treatment of atomic veterans concerns, and that is the VA's 1993 decision to grant VA benefits based on presumptive service connection to veterans exposed to agent orange who have contracted lung cancer, a decision which I fully back, but for atomic veterans, the VA still treats lung cancer as a nonpresumptive illness. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, we know what happened to them. They went to ground zero. They had no protective gear. They were exposed to this radiation. Why in the world has it taken us so long--they are still waiting after 40 and 45 years --to make sure they get the care they deserve and make sure they get the compensation they deserve? 
Mr. President, we just have to do better. Let me reiterate, I fully supported the decision of the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to recommend to the President that lung cancer be treated presumptively as a service-connected condition for agent orange. I wish Secretary Jesse Brown was still with us. He probably was my best friend in the administration, in Government. He was a strong advocate for veterans. I am simply pointing out that we are not giving the atomic veterans the same treatment, and it is patently unfair. 
Since January 1994, I have had a lot of meetings with members of the Forgotten 216th. I have met with their families. I met with their children. I met with their grandchildren. Let me just be very honest about this. Many of them are up there in age now. They are elderly. They may not have that many more years to live. But it is incredible to me that we have let this shameful episode in the history of our country go on by never fully acknowledging what we did to them and never providing these veterans and their families with the compassion and care that they deserve. 
I don't think it is too strong for me to say that our Government lied to them. I don't think it is unfair for me to say that for 45 years, or thereabouts, we still have not given them a fair shake. Justice delayed is justice denied. The atomic veterans are not the strongest veterans organization in our country. They don't have that much clout. Many of my friends who were atomic veterans right now have cancer. Many of them are not in good health. Many of them have already died. 
They are not, in short, a strong lobby. But, Mr. President, I am telling you, I had a chance to talk to some of the atomic vets before coming out on the floor of the Senate. I had a chance to talk with my colleague from Maryland, and she really helped me with this amendment. She said to me, `Senator Wellstone, if you think about it in steps, it makes more sense. First, we get the CBO study, and we make it clear we want that study, we want to know what it costs, so we are not just putting veterans in parentheses, out of sight out of mind. And then have some closure and make it clear that within 60 days the Committee on Veterans' Affairs will hold hearings and consider legislation that moves this forward.' 
For some colleagues, and in a way for myself because I am always so impatient, who say, `Well, but it doesn't guarantee the result,' that is true, but these atomic veterans have been so out of sight and so out of mind for so long that I really think this would be a really good, positive step that the U.S. Senate would be taking. 
I don't know whether there will be opposition or not to the amendment. I hope there will be strong support for it. I really think this is the right thing to do. I am convinced that if every single Senator on the floor of the Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, had full knowledge of this history and full knowledge of what these veterans have gone through and full knowledge of the terrible illnesses in their families--it is really awful. This amendment doesn't even cover, I say to my colleague from Maryland, some of the pattern of disabilities and illnesses of children and grandchildren, which is frightening to me. 
I just don't know, I am not prepared to say what has happened genetically within families. I don't know. I am not a doctor, and I am sure there is probably disagreement about it. But what there shouldn't be disagreement about is that these veterans deserve better. These atomic veterans are veterans. These atomic veterans deserve better from our Government, they deserve better from our country, and it is time that we take action that would be a first major step toward providing them with the compensation and care which they truly deserve. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Ohio to introduce a bill that is an important step toward protecting the lives and the future of this Nation's children. Today in the Labor Committee, we will hear from the parents of a 3-month-old baby who lost his life after only 2 hours in daycare. We as a society must share some of the responsibility for this tragedy with the daycare center that neglected Jeremy Fiedelholtz. We as a society have allowed daycares to be under funded and understaffed, because we have not valued the position of daycare provider. We have not treated that job as a profession, we have not respected their responsibilities and considered such individuals to have a career worthy of compensation, attention, and respect. 
The bill that my colleague and I introduce today would provide loan forgiveness for individuals who earn a degree in early childhood education, and enter and remain employed in the early child care profession. It would also provide forgiveness for some existing child care providers who remain in the profession. 
The bill seeks to make child care more affordable and to increase the quality of child care by making a career in child care more profitable. It would help make the career of caregiver more affordable and more feasible for those interested in helping children grow. Nationally, child care workers have the following statistics: 97 percent are female; 33 percent are women of color; 41 percent have children; 10 percent are single parents; only 18 percent of child care centers offer their workers health coverage. 
In Minnesota child care centers, the average hourly wage for a child care provider is $8.72; for an assistant teacher is $6.66; and for an aide is $5.69. Minnesota family child care providers, who are never covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, have an average hourly wage of $2.79, and make $7,800 a year for a 60-hour work week. With changes created by the welfare bill in the Federal child care food program, many family child care providers will become ineligible for this program; those who don't pass the costs of care on to the parents will have negative earnings--they will actually lose $71 a week. 
Nationally, child care teaching staff earn $6.89 an hour and $12,000 a year. Family child care providers earn $9,500, and unregulated providers, $5,100. Although they are better educated than the average worker, child care workers earn one-third of the average male salary and one-half of the average female salary. It is no surprise that one-third of them leave their centers every year. 
In the meantime, in Minnesota, there are 8,960 children on the waiting list for child care. There are probably another 13,440 children who would apply if the waiting list wasn't so long. Mr. President, add all this up and you have a recipe for disaster. Child care is without question among the most important issues facing the workforce today. Parents who can't care for their children, can't work. Child care is without question among the most important issues facing the field of education today. Children who are not stimulated and cared for during the earliest years will never be able to reach his or her full potential when they grow up. 
If we don't take the profession seriously and encourage people of caliber to enter the profession of caregiving, and reward those who remain in the profession, then we are risking our economic future and putting at risk millions of children like Jeremy Fiedelholtz. I urge my colleagues to join us in this bipartisan effort to invest money where it is most needed. 
Let me just say I am very honored to introduce this legislation with Senator DeWine. I thoroughly enjoy working with him, and I think we are both very committed to this piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, in the Labor Committee today, we are going to hear from the parents of a 3-month-old baby who lost his life after only 2 hours in child care. If you look at the reports, the conditions around our country are not what they should be for children, and if you just think about the pay scale of women and men--they are mainly women--who are child care providers, we have devalued the work of adults who work with children. What this piece of legislation does is it provides loan forgiveness for individuals who earn a degree in early childhood development and then remain employed in this early childhood profession. It also would have some forgiveness for existing child care providers who remain in the profession. 
What we are simply trying to say here, I say to my colleagues, is that the neuroscience evidence is compelling, these early years are critical years, we have to get it right, there has to be a nurturing care and the intellectual stimulation and, yet, if you look around the country, nationally child care teaching staff earn an average of $6.89 an hour, or about $12,000 a year. 
Actually, in many of our States, people who work in zoos, and by the way I love visiting zoos--it is not my point to put down that work--earn twice as much as women and men who work in child care centers. If we really value children and we really understand that pre-K is so important, and if we really understand--and we should and we must--that we have to make sure that by age 3, children have gotten the nurturing care in order for them to be able to go on and do well in school and do well in life, then it is terribly important that we attach more value to the work that is being done. 
That is what this piece of legislation does, which provides the loan forgiveness for women and men I hope will go into this profession. It is a small step forward, but it is an extremely important step. 
I am very pleased to introduce this legislation today with my colleague, Senator DeWine.

Mr. WELLSTONE. We will have some discussion on this issue, I gather. And I wanted to say to my colleagues, that several days ago I sent a letter out to every colleague saying that I was going to have an amendment out here opposing the cost-of-living adjustment for members of Congress--and you are quite right, I say to my colleague from Colorado, this is not a pay increase. This was just a cost-of-living adjustment. I would like to explain a little bit about why I did this. 
Senator Brownback has now come out with the same amendment, so we will work together. And it does not matter to me who does the amendment. What matters is the effect of it all. But I think that I may have somewhat of a different framework than my colleague from Kansas, and so I want to spell out my reasons why I support this amendment. And I am not going to spend a lot of time on it. 
First of all, when I sent this letter out, I sent it only to my colleagues. I was not interested in this becoming a major public issue, although when we work this out on the floor, I suppose it is a public issue. The reason for addressing my colleagues is that I really think that if this amendment becomes a bashing of public service--and I know some colleagues will interpret it that way--then it is a big mistake. If that is what the net effect of this amendment is, I made a big mistake. 
I think there are people here--Republicans and Democrats; Democrats and Republicans--who have a highly developed sense of public service. If this amendment, which is likely to be accepted, contributes to an across-the-board denigration of public service and all people in public service, then sending this letter out to my colleagues and saying that I would introduce this amendment would have been a mistake. But I now join in sponsoring this amendment. 
This amendment will not make some people feel better about it. The reason I introduced it, and I wish to make this very clear--is because this past year, in our deficit-reduction plans, as the Center on Budget Alternatives and Priorities points out, 93 percent of the cuts we made in discretionary spending affect low-income people and some of the most vulnerable citizens in our country. 
In the welfare bill that we passed, $55 billion of cuts disproportionately hurt legal immigrants--not illegal--many of them elderly, many of them living alone, many of them with a combined income of $525 a month--all their Federal assistance was eliminated. Only part of it was restored. 
And the other major area that suffered was in food nutrition programs--the vast majority of the cuts in the welfare reform bill passed last Congress were in the Food Stamp Program. Most of the beneficiaries hurt were working poor people, many of them children. 
So it just seems to me that if we are going to be making, in the name of deficit reduction, cuts in programs, and the disproportionate share of those cuts affect the most vulnerable people in our country, many of them children, many of them poor, I just cannot see how we can give ourselves a cost-of-living increase. 
I do not even know what we make--I guess around $130,000 a year. I put high value on the work we do here. But I just want to point out that a colleague asked me yesterday, after I sent this 
letter out, `Well, come on, Paul. Would there be a time where you would vote for this? Isn't this just what you do every year?' Well, I do not offer this amendment every year. So I said, `Absolutely, yes, but not in the context of what we have done as a Senate and a House.' 
I am sure some people believe we have done the right things here in Congress. No one has a corner on political truth. Maybe people felt the votes we have made, for deficit reduction and for cuts in different programs, were the right thing to do and had to be done. But it does seem to me that it is just not right, if we are going to call on many citizens to sacrifice for deficit reduction, and in particular, call on low- and moderate-income families to sacrifice all in the name of deficit reduction, and if we are going to make cuts in the most effective child nutrition safety program that we have ever had, then I just do not think this is a time for us to be giving ourselves a cost-of-living increase. 
In some context, I can see how the argument over this cost-of-living increase can be said to be about apples and oranges. I really can. But the way I see it as a Senator, in the context of still calling for people to make sacrifices in our country, that there ought to be shared sacrifice. And I think, given the fact that we all do well financially in Congress, that it is a mistake to go forward with the cost-of-living increase. 
That is why I sent the letter to my colleagues 2 days ago and why I announced my intention to introduce an amendment. 
Senator Brownback has now come out with an amendment. We will join together on this. The Senator can speak for himself, but I wanted to make my framework clear on why I am against a cost-of-living increase. 
If there is further debate on this, I have a more complete statement, but I have stated what I believe and there is no reason to speak at any greater length now. 
I thank my colleagues.  
Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as I said earlier, I sent a letter out to my colleagues a couple of days ago and now this amendment has been introduced. I spoke earlier about it, and I will again. I want to respond to some comments--if the word `demagog' is going to be used, I want to respond. 
I said earlier that if the net effect of this amendment is to encourage the denigration of public service and people in public service, then I am mistaken in offering this amendment--the Wellstone-Brownback amendment. Several days ago, I felt that I needed to get started on this and announced I would do it when this bill came to the floor. I then went on to say that in the context of what we have been doing here in the Congress, and the sacrifices that we have asked of all Americans, especially low- and moderate-income people that I believe it is wrong for the Members of Congress to receive a cost-of-living increase. We have made a lot of cuts in programs. Again, in the 104th Congress, more than 90 percent of the budget reductions in entitlement programs came from programs affecting low-income people. If we are going to argue that that has to be a part of the sacrifice, I don't see how we can then go forward with a cost-of-living increase. We will still be making more than $133,000 next year without the increase. 
But, Mr. President, my colleague from Alaska has come to the floor and has made several arguments that I have to address. First of all, Mr. President, my colleague suggests that if young people know they can only make $133,000 a year, why would they want to serve in the Senate or House? He goes on to suggest that the only people are going to come here are either millionaires or people who could not make $100,000 a year. 
I was a teacher. I didn't make anywhere near $100,000. By my colleague's standard, 95 percent of the people of the United States of America are the people who can't make $100,000 a year, because they clearly don't. Let's not assume that because someone was a teacher or a wage earner, and didn't make $100,000 a year, that somehow they don't have that much value. What in the world does that comment mean? You know, with all due respect, I think most people in the country would think $133,000 a year is a darn good salary, because 95 percent of the people in this country don't even make $100,000 a year. Maybe we just need to get a little bit more real about this for a moment. 
I didn't want to get into this argument, but if that's the kind of argument that is going to be made, I would like to make it clear that, having been one of those individuals that falls into my colleague's category of not being able to make $100,000 a year, I think that this is an argument that is way out of whack with reality. 
I doubt whether, if you took a poll, most of the people in the country would believe that a salary of $133,000 a year is a disincentive for somebody wanting to take this job. I don't believe that. I don't believe that most young people in this country would not run for the U.S. Senate because they are only going to be able to make $133,000 a year. I don't believe that for a moment. When some of my colleagues say that this would be a reduction in salary, the vast majority of the people in the country would not view it that way. That argument just doesn't make sense to me. As I said, I didn't want to get into these arguments, but if the word `demagog' is going to be used, then I do want to respond. 
Second of all, Mr. President, if we are going to start talking about the financial pressures that we as Senators feel with our income, for those of us who aren't independently wealthy, and talking about our need for two homes or to send children to college, that's a valid point. A lot of people feel that pressure. The median income in our country is around $36,000 a year. There are a lot of people with two or three children. There are a lot of people trying to figure out how to afford to send their kids to 
college. There are a lot of people who are trying to get affordable child care or to figure out how to buy a home or pay rent. And by the way, when we talk about trying to pay rent, I note that we have also been cutting low-income housing assistance. So when I hear this argument that the only people that are going to come here are millionaires or people who can't make $100,000 a year, there is an implication that these aren't the people you want to have come here. I think it would be good if we have lots of those people here. I sure didn't feel like I was not of value to this body because I didn't make anywhere close to $100,000 a year before I came here. 
When I hear the argument made that people would not want to serve, that young people would not want to serve, and people don't want to run for office because they would only be able to make $133,000 a year without this cost-of-living increase, I frankly think it is not a credible argument. I think 99.999 percent of the people in the country think they could get along on our salaries. The third point, Mr. President, that I want to make is that if we are going to talk about the squeeze that we feel at $133,000 a year, then how come in some of the decisions that we have made about sacrifice, cuts in health care programs, nutrition programs, housing programs--which basically affect and end up lessening opportunities for low- and moderate-income families--how come we then don't have the same concern for those families? 
If we are worried about how, on $133,000 a year, we can send our kids to college or afford housing, why aren't we as worried about middle-income and working families? I think this is a slippery-slope argument. We had better get to work thinking about the couple who work, in their early thirties and who make, combined, $35,000 a year. We had better start thinking about them because if all of a sudden we are going to be talking about how we just can't make it on $133,000 a year, then surely we must understand how people--middle-income and working families with incomes of $35,000 to $38,000 a year--feel a terrible squeeze. It is just an inconsistent argument for us to make. 
Mr. President, if I am wrong about why we should not have a cost-of-living increase, I have made a big mistake and apologize. But if not having a cost-of-living increase this year and staying at $133,000 is the reason why people are not going to run for office, which my colleague from Alaska thinks is the case, he is right, and I am wrong. But I don't think that is the major reason why people aren't running. 
I think that one of the major reasons people are not running for office is it costs so much money to run for office. If we really want more women and men from all sorts of different social and economic backgrounds to run for office in our country, it doesn't have much to do with whether or not we make $133,000 or $134,000 a year. Most people think that is a fine salary. It has much more to do with the fact that people know that they have to raise millions and millions of dollars. Either they themselves are millionaires and they have the money--and we have some people in this Senate who are independently wealthy, who are some of the best Senators. That is a fact. I don't think that is the issue. The issue is all of this money that people have to raise. 
Give me a break. Don't tell me that the reason people do not run for office and young people aren't interested in public life is because they are now finding out they are only going to make $133,000 a year. I think that is ridiculous. 
I think the reason many people don't run for office is twofold: First, it costs so much money. It is obscene, and a lot of people do not have the stomach for it. They don't want to do it. And I don't blame them. I think they wonder how we have the stomach for it. I think they think that maybe we are a little off. Or second, and just as important--and I could sure draw from some examples, but I will not because I might be violating Senate etiquette if I do--is why in the world when we have this search-and-destroy, slash-and-burn politics, where people do anything to win--that anybody wonders why people do not want to run for office? Does anybody here, Democrat or Republican alike, really believe that the reason younger people, and not such young people, do not run for office is because they can only make $133,000 a year? Don't you think it might have something to do with our failure to clean up this mess, to come together and pass some kind of good campaign finance reform bill? And don't you think it has a lot to do, Republicans and Democrats alike, with the way in which we have let all of these handlers move in and run our campaigns, putting attack ads on television which try to destroy candidates? Don't you think this is what makes most people in the country just a little bit skeptical about whether or not they would want to run for office and serve? I would just suggest to my colleagues that this situation is far more the issue than a cost-of-living increase. 
Finally, I will just go back to the first point I made today. I was just responding to what was said by my friend from Alaska--and to the concern about demagoguery on this issue. I admire people who come out here and say, `I disagree.' I am quite often on the side of something that is not popular. But I do believe that the arguments so far that have been given in opposition to this amendment don't make any sense. They really do not make any sense. 
I believe that it is important that people be able to make a decent income. We should vote, at the right time, for a 
cost-of-living increase, and not try to do this through the back door. People believe this is the right way to do an increase. But I don't see how we can do it in the context of the decisions that we have made and the sacrifice that we have called for from the people in this country that have been most affected by the decisions. I don't see how, if we are going to make the argument that people feel an economic squeeze at $133,000 a year, while most of the cuts we make in discretionary programs hurt low- and moderate-income families and their children in the name of sacrifice and in the name of deficit reduction, that this is the right time for us to go forward with a cost-of-living increase. 
That is the purpose of what I called the Wellstone-Brownback amendment, or whatever we wish to call it--it's name doesn't matter. 
Obviously, this amendment is going to be accepted. Is my understanding correct that this amendment is going to be accepted?

Other people may have very different arguments to make, and if anyone else is going to use the word `demagogue' then I am certainly going to come back out here to debate on this amendment. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, these letters are extremely important. They are from three very fine veterans organizations: The DAV, the PVA, and the Vietnam Veterans of America. The reason they are concerned, and, for that matter, all of the veterans community is concerned, is that in the budget resolution what we ended up putting into effect was a cut in veterans health care benefits. 
Mr. President, the portion of those cuts that directly affect veterans health care is $400 million. What this amendment does is simply authorize the Secretary of Defense the ability to be able to transfer this $400 million into the veterans health care. 
Mr. President, let me just say to colleagues that this is a huge issue. I am positive that if my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, get a chance to talk with the veterans organizations and veterans communities in their States, they will find out that people are really indignant about this because it was never clear--I don't think it was clear to any of us--that, in fact, we were voting for actual cuts, actual cuts in veterans health care. 
What this amendment does, it says, look, we have $2.6 billion in the Pentagon budget more than the Pentagon asked for; we can at least take a portion of this. And please remember, all this amendment does is give the Secretary of Defense the discretion or the authority to be able to transfer it. It is not a mandate. It seems very appropriate. 
Mr. President, it seems like this amendment that Senator Harkin and I have introduced is eminently reasonable because if you think about it, one of the huge concerns in the Veterans' Committee is very much linked to national defense. We are talking about men and women who have served our country. As we look at veterans health care and we project to the future, we want to make sure we do not end up sacrificing the quality of care for veterans. 
I know what I hear back in the State of Minnesota, first and foremost, we have now an increasing number of gulf war veterans who are in need of help. 
This is yet an additional challenge for the VA. This is an additional challenge for our country to get the care to these people. 
Mr. President, this amendment, again, just authorizes the Secretary of Defense to make this transfer of funding. These veterans were all about serving our country in defense of our country. If there ever was an opportunity to restore this funding for veterans health care, it is now. This Congress, whether it is this afternoon, or whether it is next week, or whether it is next month, is going to have to restore this funding. I don't think there was one Senator that was clear, when we passed this budget resolution, that we were actually directing $400 million of cuts in veterans health care. 
I will just tell you that more and more and more of the gulf war veterans are going to be stepping forward in your States, in our States, and they are going to be saying: We don't know what happened to us, but we do know that before we went and served, we could run 2 miles and we felt good, and now we can't walk a half mile, and we don't know what happened to us. 
Over and over again, we are seeing report after report that makes it crystal clear that the gulf war veterans have every reason in the world to be indignant about not getting information that they need to get from our Government and, more important, about their need to receive some care. So what in the world are we doing cutting $400 million in the veterans health care budget? 
In addition, Mr. President, let me simply point out that above and beyond the gulf war veterans, we have a situation where our veterans population is aging. More and more of our veterans are living to be 65 years of age and over. More and more of our veterans are living to be 85 years of age and over. And this is an additional strain. 
So, Mr. President, I want to point out that, at the very time that veterans are showing up at VA hospitals in greater numbers, with increasing health care costs generally and prospects for greater medical costs specifically, at the very time that we have that going on, we have a cut in this budget resolution. 
So, what we are saying in this amendment--and I will defer to my colleague from Iowa in a moment--we are saying, look, we have an excess $2.6 billion. It is more than the Pentagon asked for. We have a cut in veterans health care in the budget resolution to the tune of $400 million. It is clear it is going to have very negative consequences for veterans. The veterans community in our Nation--I have just three letters, from the PVA, DAV, and Vietnam veterans, and they are saying: You can't do that. What about those of us who are struggling with posttraumatic stress syndrome? What about the Persian Gulf veterans? More and more are asking: What happened to us? More and more of those veterans are asking for adequate care. What about the ever-increasing aging population among veterans at the very time there is going to be more of a strain? At the very time that we have more of a challenge, you have cut $400 million. 
This is an opportunity to come through for the veterans community. I hope it will happen today. I hope we get a very strong vote today. I say this to all my colleagues. One way or another, we are going to have to restore this funding. This amendment, if you just think about the wording, just provides 
the Secretary of Defense with the authorization to transfer some of this funding to VA health care--$400 million--and it makes eminently good sense because, after all, these veterans who come and seek health care within our VA health care system were the very men and women who served our country in defense of our country. 
Mr. President, how much time do we have left?

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Paul D. Staudenmaier, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Duluth, MN. On September 13, 1997, he will retire with over 21 years of dedicated service. 
Paul's career with the Boys Clubs began in Chicago over 46 years ago. In his teens, he was headed for a gang fight, when a member of the Chicago Boys Club urged him to come to the area club. He started as a games room worker at the former Harper Chicago Boys Club on the south side of Chicago and progressed through many different positions in the Chicago area clubs. He was program director at the Woodlawn Boys Club, unit director at the Lathrop Boys Club on the north side, and unit director at the Valentine Boys Club in the old neighborhood of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley. 
Paul received his masters degree in education administration with the help of a Boys Club Scholarship from New York University. He also served in the army in the Korean conflict, married Fran, his wife, and had four sons. 
In 1977, when Paul became executive director of the Boys Club of Duluth, the club was floundering and needed strong leadership. The club had less than $500 in the bank, and over $4,000 in unpaid bills. Housed in an old church building, it also needed a new boiler. Through the generous efforts of the United Way of Duluth, Paul secured a new boiler and from then on, changes occurred for the better. 
By 1980 the club was changing to have memberships for boys and girls. It took 10 years before the national organization gave the recognition to become the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Paul's many contributions have included helping to form the Help a Boy and Help A Girl scholarship which has been a very successful program. In 1982, he formed the Mighty-Mites for 4- to 5-year old children, a summer program for working mothers and in 1984, the Summer Fun Bunch for children, ages 6 to 12 years old. In 1985, he started the Operating Endowment Fund which is now the Boys and Girls Club of Duluth Foundation with assets of over $400,000. 
One of the highlights of Paul's career came in 1992 when a joint partnership was formed with the Duluth school district at the Lincoln Park School, located just a few blocks from the club. The Lincoln Park neighborhood has a ratio of 70 to 80 percent of single parent families and now has become a youth and family center that serves approximately 800 youth. 
It offers community swimming and gym classes for parents and children, and has a computer center for use after school hours for youth and parents, and offers many other youth and family programs. The program at the Lincoln School has been so successful that the existing club will be converted into a full service teen center. Paul's ability to look ahead has helped the club to form a strategic planning committee. One of its goals is to work with the local school district to form more joint ventures at other schools in other areas of the city. 
Paul Staudenmaier's contributions over the years are impressive and noteworthy, and it is an honor for me to pay tribute to this remarkable and dedicated man. As family, friends, and colleagues gather to honor Paul on September 13, 1997, I join them in conveying my heartiest congratulations. 
It is a privilege for me to join in honoring his distinguished career of service to others. As you celebrate this milestone, all the best on this occasion and I extend my warmest wishes to Paul for a well-deserved retirement, filled with continued good health and happiness.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I, again, want to stress support from three organizations that have had a chance to really take a look at this. I think there is broad support from the veterans community--I really hope that we will get a strong vote for this amendment--from the Disabled American Veterans, from the Vietnam Veterans of America, and from the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Earlier I asked unanimous consent that letters of their support be printed in the Record. 
What we do here is we just simply give the Secretary of Defense discretion authority to transfer $400 million to the VA to restore VA funding for health care. This was cut in the budget resolution. 
Again, I want to make it real clear to my colleagues that I don't think any of us really understood that we were going to have these kind of deep cuts in the VA health care budget. I want to, in a couple of minutes, make the point that we are not just talking about abstract numbers and statistics, we are talking about people's lives. In particular, I want to talk about what the VA health care system is dealing with. 
First of all, the Persian Gulf veterans. When we had testimony in the Veterans' Committee, it was very, very important that when General Schwarzkopf came in, one of the points he made was one commitment we can make to the gulf war veterans, I say to my colleague from Iowa, is to make sure we do the research as to what happened to them, and, second of all, we make sure that those veterans get the health care that they need. 
Mr. President, this has everything in the world to do with defense. They were there supporting our country, and, in addition, let me point out that the Department of Defense, I think if there was any one agency in Government that would be more than willing to transfer a little bit of funding to make sure those veterans get health care, it certainly would be the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense. 
So it is a mild amendment. It does not ask for much. It just simply says we shouldn't have cut this $400 million. I want to make it real clear on the Senate floor, that if we don't win today--and I hope we will--my colleague and I are, one way or another, absolutely committed to restoring this funding. 
You can be talking about the gulf war veterans, you can be talking about the Vietnam veterans, you can be talking about post-traumatic stress syndrome, you can be talking about World War II and Korean war veterans who are now older and need the care as well. Mr. President, by the year 2000, one out of every three veterans is going to be 65 years of age or older, and 63 percent of all American males over the age of 65 will be veterans. These are the demographics. 
So there is nothing more important we can do than to make 
sure that we live up to our contract to provide these veterans with the support that they need. 
What is going to happen if we don't restore the funds? This is my conclusion. It is a simple argument we are making. If we don't restore the $400 million this year, what is going to happen is we are going to accelerate closure of inpatient care, we are going to offer fewer ambulatory services, we are going to reduce long-term care, and we are going to treat fewer veterans. That is what is going to happen. That is wrong. If we want to help veterans, this is an opportunity to do so. 
We all love to be in the parades, we all speak at the veterans' gatherings, we all say it is a sacred contract, we all say that we support veterans. Well, Mr. President, we cut $400 million, and my colleagues can ask any veteran in any of your States, and they didn't know about it. 
Now is the time to rectify this mistake. Now is the time to take a small amount of money, $400 million, out of $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon asked for and at least give the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer this funding. I am sure this will happen if we vote for it, and I hope that we get a very strong vote. 
This amendment is a justice amendment. We should not be cutting health care services for veterans. The demand is increasing for that care, and we ought to, as U.S. Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, respond to veterans, we ought to support veterans, and the right thing to do is to vote for this amendment. 
I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Iowa for all of his support.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, which I offered on behalf of myself, Senator Harkin, Senator Daschle, and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, is very simple and straightforward. It simply would authorize the Secretary of Defense to be able to transfer $400 million to veterans health care. 
In the budget resolution, we cut $400 million out of the health care budget of veterans. We have more Persian Gulf veterans who are seeking care. We have more and more veterans who are living to be 65 and living to be 85. We have veterans who are struggling with PTSD. This is a huge mistake. We should not be doing this. This gives us an opportunity to really be there for veterans. 
There are three wonderful letters from Paralyzed Veterans of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, and Disabled Veterans of America, all of which strongly support this amendment. I hope we will have a good, strong vote. I hope we will win on this. I say to colleagues, one way or the other, we have to restore these cuts in veterans health care.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just as a courtesy to my colleagues, let me say that I am not offering a new amendment. This is an amendment that I introduced yesterday morning. I wanted to take advantage of this time to speak about this amendment. 
This amendment would authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer $5 million out of the $265 billion Pentagon budget--some $2.6 billion more than the President himself asked for--to the Secretary of Agriculture, to be used for outreach and startup grants for the school breakfast program. 
Mr. President, this amendment involves a very small amount of money. While it involves a small amount of money--at least given the kind of money we are dealing with here--it actually speaks to a very large question. I think the question has to do with what our priorities are. 
I think it is a distorted priority to provide the Pentagon with $2.6 billion more than it originally asked for. For the third year in a row--these are one of the few times I can remember in my adult life that the Congress actually wants to provide the Pentagon with more money than the Pentagon has actually asked for. At the same time, when it comes to some really vitally important programs that dramatically affect children's lives, we don't make the investment. 
By way of background: In the welfare bill that passed last Congress, $5 million was eliminated from a critically important program, which was a program that on the one hand provided States and school districts with the information they needed--call it an outreach program--about how they could set up a breakfast program, and on the other hand, it provided some badly needed funding for some of the poorer school districts to actually, for example, purchase refrigerators in order to have milk. 
It is difficult to understand how this could have been cut, especially given the heralded success of the school breakfast program. Some things I guess we do not know enough about, but we do know that a nutritious breakfast really is important in enabling a child to learn. We also know that if a child is not able to learn, as I said yesterday, when he or she becomes an adult they may very well not be able to earn. This is a small amount of money that makes a huge difference. 
So this amendment says that out of a $265 billion Pentagon budget, some $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon asked for, can't we authorize the Secretary of Defense to be able to transfer $5 million--$5 million--for school breakfasts? For what I would call catalyst money that gets necessary information out to the States and school districts and some needed assistance by way of refrigerators and resources to enable them to expand the school breakfast program. 
Mr. President, I want to point out by way of context that there are still some 27,000 schools that do not have school breakfast programs available. There are some 8 million vulnerable, low-income children, therefore, who are not able to participate. Too many of those children go to school without having had a nutritious breakfast. 
This may seem abstract to many of us in the Senate, but it is a very concrete and a very important issue. 
This amendment has the support of FRAC, the Food Research Action Center, which has a longstanding history of working on childhood hunger and nutrition issues. It has the support of the Elementary School Principals Association, the American School Food 
Services, and Bread for the World. 
Mr. President, I might point out that these organizations have a tremendous amount of credibility for all of us who care about hunger and malnutrition. These are organizations that have been down in the trenches for years working on these issues. I don't think anybody can quarrel with the values and ethics of Bread for the World and the work that they have done, much of it very rooted in the religious community, and the American School Food Services. These are food service workers. These are the people who know what it means when they can't provide a nutritious breakfast to low-income students. 
This is a special endorsement for me because my mother was a food service worker. 
What the Elementary School Principals Association is saying by endorsing this amendment is simply this: If a child hasn't had a nutritious breakfast, how is that child going to be able to learn? 
Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about the extent of hunger and the scope of the problem. This is from the Food Research Action Committee. 
Approximately 4 million American children under the age of 12 go hungry, and approximately 9.6 million are in risk of hunger. According to estimates based on the results of the most comprehensive study ever done on childhood hunger in the United States--this was the community childhood hunger education project--based on the results of over 5,000 surveys of families with incomes below 185 percent of poverty, applied to the best available national data, FRAC estimates that of the approximately 13.6 million children under age 12 in the United States, 29 percent live in families that must cope with hunger or the risk of hunger during some part of one or more months in the previous year. 
Let me just raise a question with colleagues before we have this vote. I just think that this goes to the heart of what we are about. This goes to the heart of priorities. 
I, as a Senator from Minnesota, tire of the symbolic politics. We have had the conferences on early childhood development. The books and the reports, the magazines, the TV documentaries have come out. 
We know--let me repeat this--we know that in order for children to do well, it is important that they have a nutritious breakfast. We know that when children are hungry, they don't do well in school. We know, as parents and grandparents, that we want to make sure that our children and our grandchildren start school after having a nutritious breakfast. And we also know, based on clear evidence, that sometimes we don't know what we don't want to know--that there is a significant amount of children who still go to bed hungry or still wake up in the morning hungry and go to school hungry. 
Why can't the U.S. Senate make this small investment in this program which was so important in enabling States and school districts to expand the school breakfast program? 
Mr. President, I am going to bring this amendment to the floor of the Senate over and over and over again starting with this defense authorization bill. 
Let me just read. I am assuming that my colleagues are interested in this information, and I am assuming that we want to address the problem. Let me just talk a little bit about this relationship between hunger and nutrition and learning.  
Undernutrition increases the risk of illness and its severity. 
Undernutrition has a negative effect on a child's ability to learn . . . 
Iron deficiency anemia is a specific kind of undernutrition and is one of the most prevalent undernutritional problems in the United States especially among children. Even mild cases lead to shortened attention span, irritability, fatigue and decreased ability to concentrate . . . 
Hunger leads to nervousness, irritability, disinterest in the learning situation, and an inability to concentrate . . . 
Hunger . . . disrupt(s) the learning process--one developmental step is lost, and it is difficult to move on to the next one.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. The respect is mutual. 
I just wanted to say--it was going to be a question, but I can just make a comment instead--as a matter of history, the School Lunch Program was created by the Congress 50 years ago, and I quote, `As a measure of national security to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's children.' It was a direct response to the fact that many of the young men who were drafted in World War II were rejected due to conditions arising from nutritional deficiencies. So there is, in fact, a direct linkage to national defense. 
It is, in fact, very much a national security issue to make sure that children have full nutrition and that we do not end up with men and women later on who have not been able to learn, not been able to earn and may, in fact, not even be healthy enough to qualify to serve our Nation. 
So it is an interesting history, and I just wanted my colleague to know that this program is very much connected to national security. 
My second point is I too look forward to working with my colleague in the future. But I hope to win on this amendment now. This is simply a matter of saying, look, we have a budget that is $2.6 billion over what the Pentagon asked. There have been plenty of studies which have pointed out excesses in the defense budget. Can we not at least authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer this $5 million. 
And then, finally, I say to all my colleagues that I think there is going to come a point in time where people cannot--and I know the Senator from Arizona is not trying to do this--but people cannot say, well, we shouldn't vote for this now; we can't vote for this now; we won't vote for this now; there will be a more appropriate place; there will be a more appropriate time. And I find that when it comes to all these issues that have to do with how can we refurbish and renew and restore our national vow of equal opportunity for every child, the vote always gets put off. It always gets put in parenthesis. So I absolutely take what my friend from Arizona said in good faith. I look forward to working with him. But I do think that on this bill, on this amendment, this is the time to vote for such a small step for a good many very vulnerable children in our country. 
I thank my colleague for his graciousness.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, which is an amendment that I have offered with Senator Harkin, from Iowa, is very simple and straightforward. It authorizes, so it is not subject to a point of order, it just authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture $5 million over the next 5 years, $25 million altogether. That is $5 million out of a $265 billion Pentagon budget, a budget that is some $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon itself has requested. 
So out of that $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon has requested, this is an amendment that says take $5 million and transfer it to the Secretary of Agriculture; that is to say, authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer this to the Secretary of Agriculture. 
This $5 million program per year was eliminated. We should never have done that. This is to correct an egregious mistake that we made. This has everything in the world to do with malnutrition and hunger among children. This $5 million has been used effectively nationwide--a small amount of money--as a catalyst, as an outreach program, to enable States and school districts to set up and expand the School Breakfast Program. As a matter of fact, I think one of the reasons it was eliminated was that it had been so successful, in fact, in enabling school districts to expand the School Breakfast Program, the argument then being we would have to invest more resources in the School Breakfast Program. 
I read from a letter received from the Food Research & Action Center that points out that only `seven of ten, 71.4 percent, of the schools that offer school lunch participate in the School Breakfast Program. This represents only 65,000 of the almost 92,000 schools that' participate. `Additionally, just 39.6 percent of low-income children participating in the National School Lunch Program also participate in the School Breakfast Program. While more than 14 million low-income children participate in the National School Lunch Program, only 5.6 million participate in the School Breakfast Program.' 
Is it too much to ask, as we keep talking about our children being our most precious resource, given the fact that all these children are God's children, is it too much to ask for $5 million to be put back into this program that has been so successful? That is what this amendment is all about. 
Mr. President, there are 8 million children who don't participate, and if these children had a chance to get a good breakfast and these children, therefore, were not hungry, they would be in a much better position to learn. When children are hungry and children do not have a good breakfast and can't start out the day, they are not going to be able to learn, and when they are not able to learn, as adults, they are not able to earn. This amendment should be adopted with 100 votes. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this should be an easy vote for Senators: $5 million out of over $2 billion more than the Pentagon asked for to have an outreach program and enable local school districts to buy refrigerators so they can have a school breakfast program so that we can make sure that all of our children go to school and are able to learn. 
It is that simple. I mean, where are our priorities? We can't even come up with $5 million? This is not a mandate. This just simply authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer this. This is a way that we as a Senate can, in fact, commit a little bit more by way of resources to make sure that there is an adequate nutritious breakfast for more children who go to school in America. How in the world can you vote against it?

Mr. President, a report from Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition on the link between nutrition and cognitive development in children states that even before results are detectable, inadequate food intake limits the ability of children to learn, affecting their social interactions, intuitiveness, and overall cognitive functions. 
Come on, we have to stop having all of these conferences on early childhood development and talking about children, and now we know that we have some 8 million children who don't get a chance to participate in this program, we know there are many children who are malnourished, and we know for $5 million a year out of this budget, which is $265 billion, $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon asked for, we can't even make this kind of small commitment to children in America? That is what this vote is about.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be relatively brief and take just several hours--just take a few minutes to speak about this. I wanted to see if everyone was awake today. 
This is an amendment that would assist atomic veterans. Mr. President, I actually could talk for several hours about the atomic veterans. But I would just say that I think the most moving and most emotional times for me as a Senator has been time spent with atomic veterans in Minnesota. These are veterans who were asked to go to ground zero during the atomic testing in States like Nevada and were put in harm's way by our Government, and no one told them what they might be facing, and no one gave them protective gear. 
For many of these atomic veterans it has been a nightmare. This all started in the 1950's, and for decades many of them have had a pattern of illness in their families. I could go on for hours talking about what has happened to them, including high incidences of cancer for the atomic veterans themselves, and all sorts of problems of cancer and deformities with children and grandchildren. 
And to this day they still wait for adequate compensation. They wait for justice. I think it is one of the most shameful things that has happened in our country. These are veterans. 
I actually want to focus on just one small piece of this amendment. I am hoping to be able to receive good support from both Democrats and Republicans, and I am hoping this amendment may indeed be accepted. I know Congressman Lane Evans has worked on this in the House, and I believe this provision has been accepted in the House of Representatives. 
This amendment would authorize $500,000 for the third and final phase of a Defense Special Weapons Agency program at Brookhaven National Laboratory to conduct--this will sound technical, Mr. President, but it is actually pretty important--to conduct internal dose reconstructions of veterans exposed to ionizing radiation while serving in the Armed Forces. DSWA is responsible for providing dose reconstructions for most atomic veterans filing claims with the VA. Out of the funding provided to DSWA--this, again, is the Defense Special Weapons Agency--for R&D under section 201(4), $500,000 would be available for bioassay testing at Brookhaven National Laboratory for the purpose of conducting internal dose reconstructions of atomic veterans to find out what has happened to them. 
That is what this is all about. This program is crucial to atomic veterans because it provides the means, I say to my colleague from South Carolina, who has been so supportive of veterans, for more accurate reconstruction of radiation dosage. This is a vital step in ensuring that atomic veterans receive the compensation they deserve and in reassuring veterans who did not inhale or ingest radioactive particles in quantities sufficient to cause cancer. In other words, they need to know where they stand. This is a terribly important test. We do not want to eliminate the funding for this. Many veterans who have radiogenic diseases have been denied compensation often based on flawed dose reconstructions. 
Mr. President, out of the hundreds of thousands of atomic veterans--I would like my colleagues to hear this, even if they are not on the floor now as they consider how to vote on this--out of the hundreds of thousands of atomic veterans, merely 15,000 have filed claims for service-connected compensation with the VA based on disability stemming from radiogenic diseases. Of these, only 1,438 have been approved, or less than 10 percent. Just imagine this, hundreds of thousands of atomic veterans, only 15,000 claims, and only a little over 1,000 have been approved. Of this low percentage, an indeterminate percentage may have had their claims granted for diseases unrelated to radiation exposure. 
Mr. President, we have to make sure that we provide funding, a small amount of funding within the Department of Defense--that is where we have been doing this funding--to make sure that we continue this very critical test undertaken for atomic veterans. 
The White House Advisory Committee on Human Radiation 
Experiments found `that the Government did not create or maintain adequate records regarding the exposure of all participants [in nuclear weapons tests and] the identity and test locales of all participants.' This finding calls into question the current capability of the Government to come up with accurate dose reconstructions on which the approval of claims for VA compensation for many atomic veterans depend. Again, the advisory committee has said we do not have adequate data. We have not been able to keep the records. If we do not have this dose reconstruction done well, then a lot of the atomic veterans who deserve compensation for the terrible illnesses that have been inflicted upon them or their family members are not going to have the chance to get the compensation. 
The DSWA program at Brookhaven uses a technology called fission tracking analysis. It analyzes the results of urine samples from atomic veterans to arrive at internal dose reconstructions. The program seeks to improve the technique first used to establish the Marshall Islanders' exposure to ionizing radiation from atmospheric nuclear testing, the same tests that we have been using with Marshall Islanders. During the third and final phase of the program, Brookhaven plans to conduct bioassays of atomic veterans and provide technical assistance to DSWA in internal dose reconstruction. 
Here is what has happened, here is the reason for this amendment, colleagues. Unfortunately, a conflict has now taken place between DOD and VA, and it has developed on funding the final phase of the program. DSWA declines to continue funding the program because it contends that it is not in the business of medical testing, even though the agency has performed medical testing for Marshall Islanders. The VA simply claims it lacks the necessary funding. In the interests of the atomic veterans who served this country bravely and unquestionably, we need to end the bickering and ensure the program is carried out to fruition. The VFW, the National Association of Atomic Veterans, and the Disabled American Veterans agree and strongly back this amendment. It is a little bit outrageous that we have this bickering going on and at the same time you have these veterans for whom this test is the only way that they are ever going to be able to get any compensation. 
Mr. President, in closing, I note that for many years the cover of the Atomic Veterans Newsletter, the official publication of the National Association of Atomic Veterans, contained the simple but eloquent statement: `The atomic veteran seeks no special favor, simply justice.' Their fight for justice has been too long, it has been too hard, and it has been too frustrating. But these patriotic and deserving veterans have persevered and they retain their faith in America. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me in helping atomic veterans with their struggle for justice and supporting my amendment. It is a matter of simple justice. Mr. President, Congressman Lane Evans, who has been such a strong advocate for atomic veterans, has done this on the House side. I think the Senate should join in this effort. I think it would be absolutely unconscionable if we eliminated this funding for this small but very, very important program where we can have adequate data as to what kind of radiation dosage these atomic veterans were, in fact, vulnerable to, affected by, and what this means for them now. That, Mr. President, is the meaning of this amendment. 
I ask unanimous consent this amendment be set aside.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment would not be subject to any point of order. It authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer some $400 million to the VA budget for the health care for veterans. 
Mr. President, this amendment is an effort to ameliorate some damage that was done in the budget resolution that--I say to my colleagues, I do not think any Senator was really familiar with--made significant cuts in VA health care. 
My amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill would, again, authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer $400 million from the DOD budget to restore cuts in VA discretionary health care spending. This amendment responds to the health care needs of veterans by restoring some badly needed funding for programs to the fiscal year 1997 level. 
Mr. President, even with this restoration, chances are remote that the VA health care funding for fiscal year 1998 will exceed fiscal year 1997. We all know--I just want to make this clear to my colleagues--that we have an aging veteran population. We all know that as more veterans live to be over 65 and over 85, there is more of a strain on the health care budget. We want to be sure that the cut that took place in the budget resolution--which I don't think hardly any Senator was aware of, although all of the veterans organizations were aware, and there is a fair amount of indignation around the country on this question--we want to make sure that these cuts in veterans health care don't end up forcing veterans who were either disabled, ill, or poor to have to shift from VA health care to other health care. That would be a travesty for the veterans and their families, and it would also have negative consequences for VA health care in our country. 
Mr. President, it has become clear that the cuts in the veterans' discretionary programs that were agreed to as part of the budget resolution are going to have some severe, if not devastating, consequences on the quality and availability of VA health care for disabled and needy veterans. The fiscal year 1998 cuts will limit VA's ability to serve all patients entitled to VA health care. If veterans health care benefits are delayed because of reduced staffing--you have to make your cuts somewhere--or a longer waiting period, then we are going to be shortchanging men and women who have risked their lives for our country. 
Let me give you some sense of the impact of the $400 million reduction in VA discretionary spending in fiscal year 1998. Mr. President, to give you some idea about it, a $400 million reduction in VA discretionary spending in fiscal year 1998 is roughly equivalent to the cost of operating one of the smaller of the VA's 22 integrated service networks. 
I held a forum, I say to my colleagues, in May. It was unbelievable. We had a huge turnout of veterans representing, I think, all of the veterans organizations that I can think of--Vietnam Veterans of America, Disabled Americans, Paralyzed Veterans, Military for the Purple Heart, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, atomic veterans, you name it. 
The Minnesota veterans were unanimous in denouncing the cuts in some really essential VA health care resources. Like my colleagues, I supported the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that was introduced by Senators Daschle, Domenici and Rockefeller on May 21, which called for full funding of the VA discretionary programs, including medical care for fiscal year 1998. I supported it for two reasons. First, I don't think many of us were aware that in the budget resolution there were going to be cuts in our investment in resources for VA health care. Second, I think it is simply the wrong thing to do. I think there is a sacred contract with our veterans, and if we are going to be making cuts and do deficit reduction, we ought not to be doing it on their backs. 
So, Mr. President, I am convinced that this amendment is appropriate. I am convinced that it is really quite appropriate to pass an amendment that gives the Secretary of Defense the authorization to authorize this transfer of funding because, after all, these veterans were fighting for the defense of the Nation. That is what it was all about. I think it is critically important that we live up to this commitment. 
Mr. President, let me just finish up again and say to colleagues that I am just introducing these amendments because, as I understand this process, we are going to have a cloture vote this afternoon and we may not have votes for about a day and there will be more time to discuss these amendments. At least, that is my understanding. I do want colleagues to be familiar with each of them. 
I think that the atomic veterans, unfortunately, have been out of sight and out of mind for all too many people in the country. This is a critically important amendment to those veterans so that they can know what happened to them. That is the very least we can do for those veterans, their children and grandchildren. 
On the second amendment, I am absolutely convinced that very few Senators were aware of the fact that the budget resolution made these cuts. It was all done in good conscience. Some of my closest friends worked on the budget resolution and supported it. My amendment simply says that we should take $400 million and heal these cuts. My amendment authorizes the Secretary of Defense to do that. I know Dr. Ken Kaiser came out to Minnesota and met with veterans, and he wasn't aware of these cuts. I have not met one person in charge of delivering health care for veterans who believes that this can be done in such a way that it will not seriously damage the quality of health care. I am not just giving some kind of trump speech on the floor of the Senate. This is very important. We ought to, at the very least, be able to transfer this small amount of money and restore this funding for our VA health care. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my colleague from Georgia.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce some amendments so that my colleagues have some knowledge of them. We will get back to them when there is more time to debate these amendments. 
The School Breakfast Program was established back in 1966 as a pilot program. It was primarily located in rural districts. The idea was that children who lived in rural areas with long bus rides might not be able to have time to eat breakfast at home. Since then, the School Breakfast Program has really become a wonderful program upon which parents and students heavily rely. In many families, a single parent is working or both parents are working, and school breakfasts are recognized as one of the most beneficial nutrition programs we have. 
Let me make it clear that a hungry child cannot learn and will likely grow up to be an adult who cannot earn. We are talking about a very wise investment. One more time. Sometimes we debate in this Chamber and we make issues out to be so complex. This is simple. A hungry child cannot learn and later on that child is quite likely to end up being an adult who cannot earn. 
To give some context, we still have some 27,000 schools that are not able to make breakfast available or that do not make breakfast available to eligible students, and 8 million low-income children who need breakfast but do not participate. What my amendment does is correct an action that we as Congress took which was egregious. In the welfare bill that we passed, we eliminated a $5 million fund which was an outreach and start-up grant for school breakfast programs. It was created in 1990, and it was made permanent in 1994. These outreach grants are one-time grants that help States develop school breakfast programs. 
Let me be crystal clear as to what is going on here. Every low-income student who is eligible for a free lunch is eligible for breakfast as well but only 40 percent of those students are able to get the assistance they need for a healthy and nutritious breakfast. The $5 million grant program was eliminated because it was an effective catalyst toward school districts expanding both their School Breakfast Programs. The welfare bill eliminated it because it was a success. 
Now, why in the world do we want to eliminate a small grant program which was such an important tool in providing a nutritious breakfast for low-income children in America? What this amendment does is to point out that in the budget plan we have $2.6 billion for the Pentagon above and beyond what the President requested. Can we not authorize the Secretary of Defense to take $5 million out of $2.6 billion more than the President even requested and put that into a grant program for States and local school districts so they can start up school breakfast programs? 
I submit that part of our definition of national security has to be the security of local communities--where every child is able to reach her and his full potential--because when our children do well, we do well. It is unconscionable that we eliminated an effective, crucial $5 million grant program when so many low-income children who need a nutritious and healthy breakfast are not able to have it. 
So this is an amendment which gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture $5 million from the $2.6 billion above and beyond what the President requested for the Pentagon. Is that too much to ask, $5 million to help State and local school districts expand the School Breakfast Program so more of the vulnerable children in this country can at least have a nutritious breakfast? That is what this amendment speaks to. This is amendment 670. 
Mr. President, I now would ask unanimous consent that this amendment be laid aside.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have a budget plan that provides an excess $2.6 billion to the Pentagon above and beyond what the President requested. This amendment would authorize the Secretary of Defense to invest that $2.6 billion in Pell grants instead of $2.6 billion into the Pentagon budget. 
If this amendment passes, we would see the maximum Pell grant go up to $3,800, and Pell grants stretch to reach 4,278,000 students. 
This would make a huge difference. There was an excellent piece by Larry Gladieux in Monday's New York Times. Gladieux made the argument that what is now being proposed--and by the way, I am trying to provide a rigorous, if you will, critique of both Republicans' and Democrats' plans on this--both the President's plan and what is being done here in the Congress through tax deductions and tax credits does not reach those families for whom higher education really has not been attainable. He pointed out, for example, that if a tax credit program is not refundable, many families with incomes under $28,000 and many community college students are not going to benefit at all. 
Talk to your financial aid offices. Talk to your students. Talk to people in your States. I know this is the case in New Mexico as well. I know that Senator Bingaman has been a huge advocate of the Pell Grant Program. You talk to many in these community college programs, many of whom are older and going back to school, and they will tell you that the Pell Grant Program is the most effective, efficient way of meeting their needs. 
Mr. President, I do not remember exactly the statistics, but there has been something like a flat 8 percent graduation rate for women and men coming from families with incomes under $20,000 a year since the late 1970's. That is a disgrace. We know higher education is key to economic success. All of us wish that higher education will be there for our children and our grandchildren, but still we have a lot of families for whom it is not affordable. The best way to make sure they have the assistance they need, the best way to make sure the Pell Grant Program can help working families, moderate-income families, even reach into the middle-income range, is to expand the Pell Grant Program. I suggest that when we have all sorts of reports that there are tens of billions of dollars the Pentagon cannot even account for in its expenditures--Senator Grassley from Iowa has done an excellent job in continuing to focus on this issue--and when you have a situation where the Pentagon in the budget resolution receives more money than the President even requested, it would seem to me we could take that $2.6 billion in excess of what is needed or has been requested and instead put it into a very successful higher education program which is all about our national defense. 
We do not do well as a nation unless we have a skilled work force. As we look to the next millennium, when so many of the industries are going to be womenmade and manmade--and many of them, Mr. President, since you are a strong advocate of small business, are small businesses--let us make sure that higher education is affordable. Let us do something that will make a huge difference. And one of the things we do is take a small amount of money--it is a small amount of money in the context of the Pentagon budget--and put it into expanding the Pell Grant Program. 
There is not one of my colleagues, Democrat or Republican, who is going to hear from the higher education community, the students or their families that more of an investment in the Pell Grant Program is not extremely important to them. It is very important to the families we represent. It is very important to the future of our States. It is very important to the future of our country. I look forward to a full debate about our priorities as we go forward with this defense authorization bill and get back to debate on each of these amendments. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their graciousness in letting me introduce these amendments today and I will yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just a very brief response. I appreciate the comments of my colleague from South Carolina. I always appreciate what he has to say. 
I do want to point out that one of my amendments--and I am hoping we can have some agreement on it--just says we should really follow the action of the House and do not eliminate a program within DOD which is a critical testing program for atomic veterans to find out what happened to them. 
The second amendment I have has a lot to do with defense. It has to do with veterans who found out after the fact that in the budget resolution we essentially put into effect cuts in veterans' health care. I just have to say to all my colleagues, these veterans are very much about our national defense. I don't think it is too much out of a $2.6 billion excess of what the President and Pentagon even asked for to say, look, let's take $400 million and put that into the VA health care budget. These veterans are all about our national defense. I think this is going to be a critically important vote, and I look forward to the debate on it. 
The third amendment I offered was an amendment which dealt with the School Breakfast Program. I again have to say, it would seem to me when we are talking about $2.6 billion more than what the President asked for, it is not so much to take $5 million which is so critical to enabling States to start up school breakfast programs and put it towards making sure that children have a nutritious breakfast before they go to school. This is all about priorities. It is not a question, I say to other Senators, of not wanting a strong defense. This is a small amount of money we are saying the Secretary might be authorized to transfer, a small amount of money with a very big bang. 
I just finished talking about how my Pell grant amendment, too, impacts our national defense. 
So, again, these amendments all focus on the $2.6 billion above and beyond what the President requested for the Pentagon. These amendments say we ought to at least give the Secretary the authority to transfer some of the small amount of funding to make sure veterans get the health care that they need or to make sure that we re-establish startup grants for the School Breakfast Program, to make sure we keep the program that we have had for the atomic veterans, and, finally, I have raised questions about an investment in education, but it is all done within the framework of an excess $2.6 billion. This is a debate about priorities, it is not a debate about who is for a strong defense. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague in offering this amendment. 
Last year during the welfare reform debate, as part of the effort to balance the budget, the 104th Congress made dramatic cuts to programs for low-income families. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, more than 93 percent of the cuts in entitlement programs in the 104th Congress came from programs for low-income people. Congress reduced entitlement programs by $65.6 billion over the period from 1996 to 2002. 
I am deeply concerned about the extent to which legal immigrants are being harmed under the Welfare Reform act. The Act cut $22 billion in services to legal immigrants--a full 44 percent of the overall legislation. 
The House Ways and Means Committee reconciliation mark provided the least generous allocation of funding for legal immigrants as compared to the budget agreement and the Senate Finance Committee mark. The $9 billion allocation in the Ways and Means mark violates the budget agreement, and it covers fewer people. Since it does not cover those who, in the future, could be eligible for SSI assistance, it will leave many without any means of support. According to the Social Security Administration, 125,000 fewer people will be served by the House agreement compared to the Budget Agreement. In Minnesota it puts 1,145 elderly immigrants at risk of losing benefits. 
Moreover, it puts an additional 161,000 people at risk of losing their benefits because their citizenship is unknown or difficult to prove. Probably the worst provision in this agreement is that it makes an inhumane and irrational distinction among disabled people based on an arbitrary date on the calendar. If you were disabled and receiving SSI on August 22, 1996, then you retain eligibility. If not, there is no hope for receiving future benefits. 
The Durbin/Wellstone amendment restores food stamp benefits to legal immigrant families with children 18 years old and under at a cost of $750 million over 5 years. Our offset is achieved by placing limits on the amount of Federal money that States can use to offset their cost share requirements in the food stamp and Medicaid programs. Our amendment would take a small step toward addressing the use of these funds and target the savings into food stamp benefits for legal immigrants who have dependent children. Over 5 years, we hope to save $1 billion, which fully covers the cost of restoring food stamp benefits. 
Unlike other low-income families in this country, legal immigrants are banned from receiving food stamp benefits. Food stamps are the Nation's largest and most successful food assistance program and cuts to this program made up half of the savings in last year's welfare reform effort. According to CBO, 17 percent of the immigrants receiving food stamps are children. This means more than 150,000 children have lost access to this critical program. In Minnesota roughly 15,900 individuals are expected to lose food stamp benefits. According to INS, most of these immigrant families will naturalize within 10 years, making them eligible to apply for food stamps. CBO estimates that it will cost $750 million to restore food stamp benefits for children 18 years and under. Senator Durbin and I have provided an offset that achieves that amount over 5 years. No matter what your position on the overall budget deal, you must agree that no purpose is served by denying children food. 
According to the Food Research and Action Center, approximately 13.6 million children under age 12 are at risk of hunger during some part of the year. FRAC reports that although families who face real issues of hunger may not be hungry every day of the month, or even every month of the year, the hunger affecting most low-income families is not a one-time or infrequent occurrence. It is characterized--and this is according to FRAC--by food shortages and chronic insecurity about whether the family will have enough food. 
We are now benefiting from scientific research that points to the significance of the early years on development of the brain. A consistently nutritious diet is one of the most important if not the most important ingredient to a child reaching his or her potential. In a 1995 study entitled Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project; a Survey of Childhood Hunger in the United States, FRAC determined that undernourished children suffer from two to four times as many health problems. I quote from the survey: 
Hungry children are more likely to be ill and absent from school. 
The infant mortality rate is closely linked to inadequate quantity or quality in the diet of the infant's mother. 
Iron deficiency anemia in children can lead to adverse health effects such as developmental and behavioral disturbances that can affect children's ability to learn and to read or do mathematics. According to the Centers for Disease Control, anemia remains a significant health problem among low-income children. 
Hungry children are less likely to interact with other people or to explore or learn from their surroundings. This interferes with their ability to learn from a very early age. 
According to the Tufts University Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition Policy, evidence from recent research about child nutrition shows that, in addition to having a detrimental effect on the cognitive development of children, undernutrition results in lost knowledge, brainpower, and productivity. 
Hunger and insecurity about whether a family will be able to obtain enough food to avoid hunger, also have an emotional impact on children and their parents. Anxiety, negative feelings about self-worth, and hostility toward the outside world can result from chronic hunger and food insecurity. 
The food stamp is designed to reach those families most in need and there is plenty of evidence that the children most at risk of hunger are in poor or low-income families. A 1996-study reported about 6.1 million children under 6 were living in poverty in 1994. An additional 4.8 million young children lived near the poverty line, according to Columbia University's National Center for Children in Poverty. Sixty-two percent of poor children lived with at least one parent or relative who worked. Fewer than one-third of the children's families relied exclusively on welfare. The poverty rate grew fastest among Hispanic children, rising 43 percent since 1979, compared with a 38-percent rise among white children and 19 percent among black children. 
Last year's reform banned legal immigrant families with dependent children from food stamp benefits. This amendment is about restoring critical food assistance to those children. We cannot say we are for children and then turn our backs on legal immigrant children. This amendment is reasonable. It's paid for and it makes imminent sense.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the tax bill before us includes important tax incentives for the use of ethanol. These tax incentives have been critical to the growth of the ethanol industry, which in my State is monopolized by farmer-owned cooperatives. Farmer-owned coops are now the leading producers of ethanol. They make up 60 percent of the ethanol facilities around the country. By year's end, nine plants will be in operation in Minnesota, producing 126 million gallons annually and creating 500 new jobs. Overall, ethanol contributes between $109 and $260 million yearly to the State's economy. Currently, 71 percent of the gas sold in Minnesota contains ethanol. By the end of the year, 100 percent of the gas sold in Minnesota will be blended with ethanol. 
My concern today is with the small blenders tax credit. This income credit is available to ethanol producers who produce no more than 30 million gallons annually; and, it is applied to the first 15 million gallons. That's great. Targeting the credit is what we should do. Unfortunately, the credit works in such a way that cooperatives fail to get any advantage from it. 
I would like to ask that when the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee conference on the two tax bills, that they give serious consideration to changing the way the credit is structured so that cooperatives, like all other ethanol producers, receive the intended benefits of the small blenders tax credit. I appreciate the good efforts of my colleagues on this matter and hope they will work with me to address this technical change in the small blenders tax credit when the committees conference on the tax bills. 
I see my colleague from Illinois and know her commitment to the role of ethanol as an alternative fuel. I understand you have two farmer-owned cooperatives proposed for construction in Illinois?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will try and take 7 1/2 minutes and leave 7 1/2 minutes for my colleague. 
Mr. President, I have more than enough to say but just in response to my good friend from Oklahoma, there was a quote--and maybe this is the same argument he is making--from Speaker Gingrich, `When you take out billions of dollars in tax cuts for working people and put in billions of dollars for people who pay no taxes, that's increasing welfare spending.' We are talking about the child credit. 
Mr. President, let me just remind the Speaker and my good friend from Oklahoma, looking at CBO numbers, this is the percentage of working families who would not be eligible for the majority party's child tax credit, whose payroll taxes exceed their income taxes. The bottom fifth, 0 to $21,700, 99.6 percent; second fifth, $21,000 to $41,000, 97 percent. 
There are a lot of working families in the State of Minnesota and all across this country who are not going to be eligible for this child tax credit who pay payroll taxes, who work hard, pay taxes, and are, quite frankly, resentful of this argument that is being made. As a Senator who represents those families, I am especially resentful of such an argument. 
I only need to know one thing about this tax proposal, this reconciliation bill. In the State of Minnesota, the tax bill excludes 41 percent of the children. Mr. President, 607,463 children of the 1.5 million children in Minnesota would not receive a benefit from the child tax credit. I repeat, 607,000 children of 1.5 million children will not receive the benefit of the child tax credit. Those are working families. 
I say to Democrats, every Democrat, every single Democrat, and as many Republicans as possible, ought to be out here advocating and fighting for those families. It is outrageous to make the argument that they do not pay any taxes or they are `just on welfare.' Absolutely outrageous. 
Mr. President, you have heard the figures presented out here so I do not need to go through that again except to say I am telling you, in the cafes in Minnesota, when people get a close look at this reconciliation bill they are going to be amazed. 
They are going to be really teed off because they are going to say, wait a minute, I thought there was going to be tax relief for us, the small business people, and us, working families. They are going to find out that the lion's share of the benefits go to the very top, the folks that are the CEO's, the multinational corporations who are raking in, on the average, $3 million a year. 
You know, Mr. President, I sometimes think that my colleagues believe that if you make $100,000 a year, you are middle class. I would be surprised if more than 10 percent of the people in this country make over $100,000 a year. What about these working families? 
Well, we have a proposal here that targets these tax benefits to working families, to small businesses, to family farmers. I am telling you, this is one of these moments where the differences between the two parties make a difference. My gosh, I think a lot of people in Minnesota are scratching their heads and saying: Has there been a hostile takeover of the Government process in Washington, DC? We have been hearing about all this money in elections, and we are now starting to believe that the only folks that sit down at the bargaining table and get their way are people who have the economic resources, because we sure are getting the short end of the stick. 
And they are right. I hope we will get a huge vote for this alternative. 
Mr. President, let me just summarize a couple of amendments. How much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I have about 3 minutes, I guess. Let me just mention a couple of amendments that fit in with this whole idea of tax fairness. 
One amendment that I hope to do, with Democrats and Republicans, is to make sure we take the HOPE scholarship program and make these tax credits refundable. It is the same issue. Think about the community college students; many are older, going back to school and with children. If we want to make sure that we are really providing help to them--they are not going to be able to take advantage of this $1,500 because they are not going to have that liability. If we want higher education to be affordable for many of these working families, we simply have to do that. A higher education is so important to how our children and grandchildren will do that I hope we will be able to pass that amendment. 
The second amendment that I want and hope to do with Senator Bumpers takes the tax cuts and puts it into a Pell grant program. We simply make the Pell grant $7,000 a year, and that is the most efficient, effective way of making sure that higher education is affordable. 
The third amendment I want to mention is the amendment I want to do with Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, which has to do with tax credits and, again, for school infrastructure. I say, what are we doing with all of these tax benefits mainly going to wealthy people and we are not investing 1 cent into rebuilding rotting schools across America? What kind of distorted priorities are out here? 
Finally, I want to mention--in case I don't have a chance later on as we run out of time--that I have an amendment I think is real interesting, which goes like this. If you have a company--and please remember that average wages rose 3 percent in 1996. Salaries and bonuses of American CEOs rose 39 percent to $2.3 million. So what I say to a company is: Look, if you want to pay your CEO over 25 times what the lowest wage worker makes, go ahead and do it, go ahead and do it. Right now, we say you can do it up to a million dollars. But don't do it on the Government's tax tab. You can pay your CEO anything you want to, but when it is above 25 times what the lowest wage worker makes, you don't get any tax breaks for doing that, just as we don't end up getting tax breaks when someone mows our lawn. We don't get to deduct that. What are 
we doing here, if we are talking about fairness? 
Well, Mr. President, the differences make a difference. This is an outrageous argument that working families paying a payroll tax are only receiving welfare payments. This is an outrageous proposition that over 600,000 children are not going to benefit in the State of Minnesota from this tax credit. We are talking about a tax bill out here that provides the lion's share of benefits to those people least in need of the assistance. 
Mr. President, there is no reason in the world for Senators to be quiet on this issue. I hope we get a very strong vote for our amendment. I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from--

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is not an objection. I am not going to object. But just the question, if I could ask it. My understanding is--I mean, there are a number of us--all of us would like to finish. Some of us have been waiting a long time, many, to have amendments and to discuss them and I don't think we want to prolong the matter. My understanding is as opposed to the beginning of the week, we don't actually have to lay the amendment down tonight in order to have that amendment up tomorrow; am I correct? My second question is, wouldn't it be a little bit more expeditious if in fact the amendment could be laid down so we don't have to go through that process at all tomorrow morning with the requirement if they are not laid down tonight they would be out of order?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dynamic leader, very capable public servant, tenacious veteran's advocate, and a good friend--Veterans' Affairs Secretary Jesse Brown. 
 I am saddened by the news that Secretary Brown is leaving after four productive and hard working years at the helm of the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs. Under his leadership, the VA and veterans have made tremendous progress. 
Jesse Brown fought battle after battle to protect, reform, and fully fund veterans' health care. Jesse Brown won most of those battles. 
Jesse Brown fought to strengthen benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. He fought for their children suffering from Spina Bifida. Jesse Brown won those battles. 
Jesse Brown fought to improve the veterans' benefits claims process. He better than anyone knew the importance of timely, accurate, and fair decisions. 
Jesse Brown worked hard for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, Persian Gulf war veterans, women veterans, homeless veterans, and many others. 
Most importantly, Jesse Brown cares about people. I've seen him on many occasions stop what he's doing to visit one-on-one with a veteran in need or a grieving loved one. In an airport, on the street, in a hospital, at VFW post, Jesse always took the time to listen to people and to try to help them. That is what leadership is all about. That is what being an effective public servant is all about. That is what being a veterans' advocate is all about. 
Jesse was never afraid to speak his mind and fight for veterans and their families--no matter the strength of the opposition or political risk to him. He did what he thought was right. He was proud to be their advocate and it should come as no surprise when said that being Secretary had been the high point of his life. Jesse Brown, a former Marine wounded in Vietnam, can feel good about his accomplishments and he can feel proud that his place in history is secure. He will be known forever as the Secretary for Veterans' Affairs. He will be known as one of the best veterans' advocates the country has ever seen. 
Here are some of the comments that veterans, their families, and veterans' advocates have shared with me since learning the news that Jesse is leaving the VA. 
Jesse brought to the VA real experience, knowledge, and wisdom to prepare the VA for the 21st Century. We'll miss him.'--Bernie Melter, Commissioner, Minnesota Department of Veterans' Affairs. 
Jesse Brown's commitment to veterans will never be questioned and his tenure as Secretary for Veterans Affairs will go down in history as the greatest advocate for veterans we'll ever see: Duane Krueger, Vietnam veteran and Anoka County Veterans Service Officer. 
Secretary Brown's departure is a major loss for all veterans. His advocacy for veterans was without regard to political affiliation and was based upon the fact that as a veteran you had earned your entitlement: Wayne Sletten, Vietnam era veteran and Lake County Veterans' Service officer. 
In my personal opinion Secretary Jesse Brown was the best leader of the VA we've ever had: Chuck Milbrandt, Director, Minneapolis VA Medical Center. 
At a time when my family was struggling to obtain my late husband's benefits for Agent Orange, Jesse took the time to personally review the case and ensure that we received all the benefits to which we were entitled. We owe a great debt of gratitude to Jesse Brown and his commitment to helping people: Leesa Gilmore, widow of Vietnam Veteran Tim Gillmore. 
Secretary Jesse Brown will be sorely missed by all of us at the St. Paul VA Regional Office and Insurance Center. He was a strong and fair leader and served as an excellent role model on how we ought to serve veterans and their dependents. We will miss his guidance, candor, and wit. We wish him the best of luck in future endeavors and know that he will continue to be a strong advocate for all veterans: Ron Henke, Director, St. Paul VA Regional Office and Insurance Center. 
These are some of the many people who have expressed their admiration and respect for Jesse Brown and who want to recognize his many achievements during his tenure in office. 
For me, I will dearly miss working side-by-side with Jesse fighting for veterans and their families. Like veterans in Minnesota, he has been my teacher and today here in the U.S. Senate I am proud to honor him and thank him for his incredible service and wonderful friendship. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to VA Secretary Brown and properly recognize him for his many years of service and commitment to the Nation and her veterans.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I offer this amendment with Senator Mikulski. We just repealed the Boren provision, which was an effort to make sure that there was reasonable and adequate rates of reimbursement. This was for nursing homes, children's hospitals, group care for people with disabilities. 
What we do in this amendment is a compromise, colleagues. We just simply require that States provide assurance to the Secretary that the rates will be actuarially sufficient to ensure adequate care. 
We don't have any vague standard. This is an actuarially sufficiency standard. We are just saying to States, let's have some standard that you can say you have had an independent analysis done and that you are providing the resources so the children's hospitals and nursing homes and group homes can provide adequate care to very vulnerable seniors, children and the disabled. 
Please vote for this compromise. We can't wipe out all of these standards. 
Other than that, I do not feel strongly about it.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very proud to join Senator Kennedy's effort. I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that this amendment is a perfect example of where the rubber meets the road. We are not now talking about adding and subtracting numbers. We are not talking about statistics in the abstract. We are talking about the effect of what we do on people's lives. We are talking about how decisions we make can crucially affect the quality or lack of quality of lives of people all across our country--in Minnesota, Massachusetts, Delaware, Oklahoma, Tennessee, you name it. 
Mr. President, I just want to take on some of the arguments that have been made about why we need to go forward with this $5 copay on the home-based health care. 
First of all, I have heard it argued here that $5 is not that much. But we cannot make those arguments, in all due respect. There is a huge difference between our salaries and what we can afford and what an elderly person can afford. 
Now, when the argument is made, `But, Senators, we have protection for those who are officially defined as poor,' do you know where that definition comes from? Mollie Orshansky in 1963, Social Security, a minimal definition--a minimal definition. So now we are saying that a single elderly woman 80 years of age, who makes over $7,000 a year, she is not officially defined as poor, but we are going to charge her $5 every time for a home-based health care visit. That is outrageous. That is outrageous. 
So, first of all, please, do not have any illusions, colleagues, that because we say the poor are taken care of, we really are taking care of vulnerable elderly people, because if you are a single person, single woman living at home and you are over the poverty level income--maybe you make $9,000 a year--you do not have any protection at all. 
Now, is there any Senator here, Democrat or Republican, who believes that a single woman living at home making $9,000, $9,500 a year can afford to pay $5 for each home health care visit? 
As to the expansion of this, in all due respect, I thought that what we were trying to do here, albeit we have not done it nearly as well as we should, is to make sure that as many elderly people as possible can live at home in as near normal circumstances as possible with dignity. We want to encourage people to be able to live at home. When one of our parents or one of our grandparents needs to have a home health visit once or twice or three times a week in order to stay at home and be independent and not have to be institutionalized, we should applaud that. It should not be surprising that this is more a part of what we do by way of investment in resources because more and more of the people in our country are living to be over 65 and 85. But if we want people to be able to stay at home and live with dignity, and we do not want people to be institutionalized, and we do not want to take away a benefit that is so important to vulnerable elderly people, even if they are over the poverty level income, which is defined in such a minimal way, we ought to for certain support this amendment. 
This amendment that Senator Kennedy and I have introduced is all about connecting this debate to people. This proposal in the Finance Committee of a $5 charge for every single home-based health care visit and support for elderly people is profoundly mistaken. Mr. President, let me repeat that. It is profoundly mistaken. Please, colleagues, admit to the fact that we may have made a mistake here and that we can do better for elderly people. Therefore, I hope that we get a huge vote for this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. President, just two points in 4 minutes, the first one being, I was listening to my colleague from Oklahoma, and I know he had to leave the floor, but I heard him say this has not been scored and it has nothing to do with the tax cuts. But, I think only here in the Senate do we sort of decontextualize what we are doing. I don't think most people in the country do. Most people in the country see a clear connection between the reconciliation bill on tax cuts, the lion's share of benefits going to the very top of the population and, at the same time, what is, indeed, the functional equivalent of a cut in Medicare benefits. 
I am troubled by the discussion because, Mr. President, I think that what some of my colleagues are talking about in the name of saving or preserving Medicare will have just the opposite effect. Maybe that is the problem. We do it on a reconciliation bill, there is not a lot of time, and we don't really know what the consequences are of what we are doing. But, I will suggest to you that if we are serious about cost 
containment and we are serious about what we need to do to deal with the estimates of how many people will be living to be over 65 and 85 when we get to the year 2030 and, at the same time, how many people are working, and all of what has been presented here by way of demography, then what we will do is not just focus on Medicare, we will go back to looking at this overall health care system, and we will figure out ways in which we contain costs so that, indeed, we can provide decent health care coverage, not just to the elderly but to other citizens as well. 
What we are doing now, philosophically, is we are moving in exactly the opposite direction. Whatever happened here? Just a couple of years ago, we were talking about Medicare for all. We were saying that we ought to make sure that other people have the same opportunities as elderly people. Now what we seem to be doing is saying, My gosh, there are some people in the country who don't have good coverage; what we now need to do is downsize Medicare instead of improving Medicare and improving health care for people in this country. It makes no sense whatsoever. 
Mr. President, this is a huge mistake--a huge mistake. We ought to be talking about providing good health care coverage for elderly people. We ought to be talking about keeping this as a universal coverage program. We ought to be talking about health care reform systemwide. And we ought to be talking about not downsizing Medicare but, as a matter of fact, taking this very good program and making sure that all of our citizens have the opportunity for decent health care coverage. 
This proposal coming out of the Finance Committee takes us exactly in the wrong direction. It is profoundly mistaken, and I thank Senator Durbin for his leadership and am proud to support his effort. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this past fall for me as a Senator, one of the proudest moments was when the Senate passed the Domenici--and I was pleased to join him--Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act. This became part of the VA-HUD appropriations bill and became, really, eventually the law of the land. This was a first and important step in ending the discrimination when it comes to health care coverage for people struggling with mental illness, to say we take another step toward punching through some of the prejudice and some of the ignorance about mental illness. 
Mr. President, I thank, and I say to my colleague from New Mexico this is really what it is all about--we have in the gallery, family gallery, people representing the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Mental Health Association. They have been here all day. This has been several days we worked on this. I believe, thanks to the strong support of Senator Domenici, that we have now an amendment that will be approved. I thank him for his fine work. 
I thank the people who have been here today, thank you for your help, and I would like to thank also Margaret Halperin who works with me in the mental health area. 
This amendment just says that now what we have done is we have focused on children's health care, we have some $16 billion of additional money. I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware for all of his fine work on this. What this amendment says is--it does not mandate anything. What it says is when it comes to providing health care coverage, now that it goes to States, as there is additional funding to provide health care coverage for children if there is going to be mental health coverage in any package that we do not have any discriminatory treatment toward those children that are struggling with mental illness. 
This is terribly important. What we are doing again is we are just kind of breaking through more prejudice. It is another step toward ending discrimination and it is so important, I say to colleagues. This is passed now at night. Tomorrow I hope we will focus on it, if not on the floor of the Senate I know there will be many people in the country who will want to focus on it, groups and organizations here that will want to focus on this. 
What this means for families and for children, I cannot even begin to explain. But let me simply say all too often it has been devastating. There has been no coverage. All too often it is children who could be doing well in school but are not able to, it is children who could live full lives but are not able to. What we do with this amendment is we take another step toward breaking through the prejudice, toward breaking through the discrimination and, we say, now that we have funds going to States and now we are going to be focusing on the health care of children, please, colleagues, please remember that when we talk about the health of children we are also talking about the mental health of children. 
That is what this amendment says. That is what this amendment is all about. I am so pleased that this amendment is going to be accepted. We will work very hard to keep this in conference committee and this, again, is an amendment with, I think, strong bipartisan support. And more than anybody here in the Senate I thank Senator Domenici for all of his help. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from New Mexico.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to put this in a little bit of context. There was a piece today in the New York Times headlined, `Study Shows Tax Proposal Would Benefit the Wealthy.' This is when we get to the tax part of the reconciliation bill. 
I quote: 
The changes in Federal tax and benefit policies now working their way through Congress would eventually be worth thousands of dollars a year to the 5 million wealthiest families in America, while the 40 million families with the lowest incomes would actually lose money, a new study shows. 
This is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Their work, generally respected in academic circles, indicates that after-tax incomes of the richest 1 percent of Americans--those with incomes above $300,000 a year for a family of three--would ultimately be increased by an average of $27,000 a year. 
`Families of three with incomes below about $17,000 a year would end up with about $60 a year less than they have now.' 
Mr. President, let me just say that, in this context, I know colleagues worked very hard in the Finance Committee, and I also know people were up very late, and we did not have a chance to study every particular proposal. The copay for home health services makes no sense at all. This proposal is profoundly mistaken. 
I am very proud to support Senator Kennedy's amendment. Sixty-six percent of the recipients of home health services are over the age of 75; 43 percent of them have incomes under $10,000 a year; 66 percent are women and 33 percent live alone. As Senator Lautenberg pointed out, a $5 copay may not sound like much to people who have pretty high incomes, and it may not sound like much to those of us in the Senate, because we earn a fair amount of income; but to people living on maybe $500 a month, and that's it, this $5 copay for a home health visit is really 
worry about it. I am hoping that we will have very strong support here on the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I think that part of the direction of where we are heading in health care--and I wish there had been more discussion. Part of the problem is that these reconciliation bills that are fast-tracked don't give us much of an opportunity to really talk about policy and its impact on people's lives. Too much of the discussion is adding and subtracting numbers. Too much of the discussion is statistics. I don't think we are looking at some of these proposals--I am not saying all of them--very carefully. To that extent, some of the things in this bill are a rush to recklessness, which I think this is. 
Mr. President, if anything, we want to make sure that as many elderly people as possible--or, for that matter, people with disabilities--can live at home with dignity. That is what we are trying to do. And what we are doing here is, we are saying to senior citizens--especially low-income, and the income profile of elderly people is not that high--we are saying, you know, we are going to start charging a $5 copay. And for a lot of these people, this isn't going to work. What is going to happen is, they are not going to get the help they need; it is that simple. 
I don't think this amendment is about party strategy or taking shots at somebody. I don't think it is about any of that. This amendment speaks to a policy discussion that I don't think we have had. I actually think that is part of the problem. I just think it is hard to do that on these bills. But this particular proposal--on this provision that was put in by the Finance Committee, I don't think there was an up-or-down vote. I think it was part of an overall chairman's mark. I think it is profoundly mistaken. I just think it was a mistake. I don't think this is the way we need to be generating revenue. This is not the place where we want to make the cuts. 
I could carry on, and I will later on by marshaling a lot of evidence about the tax part, which I still think is way too tilted to those at the top. But for right now, let me simply say, since we are talking about Medicare, let me enter into a policy discussion and just say to all Senators--Democrats and Republicans alike--I hope there will be strong support for this amendment that Senator Kennedy has introduced and that I am a cosponsor of. In this particular case, it is not a matter of numbers. You are really talking about a provision or proposal that could have a very, very negative impact on some of the most vulnerable citizens in this country. I don't think there is one Senator in here who wants to do that. 
Now, if there are some alternatives and other proposals, fine. But this was a mistake. We ought not to be doing this $5 copay on home health visits for very elderly people, most of them very vulnerable, most of them very low-income. 
So I rise to speak on behalf of this amendment. I am proud to be an original cosponsor, and I hope we will get a tremendous amount of support for it tomorrow. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I was on the floor yesterday speaking about the reconciliation bill. I decided to not go forward with an amendment today. The amendment that I was considering offering, and the amendment I offered yesterday to the intelligence bill, speak to the issue of tax fairness. But the reconciliation bill will be on the floor next week, and the DOD reauthorization is not going to come up in any case until after the reconciliation bill. So I will wait until next week and then offer amendments directly to the reconciliation bill. 
Madam President, let me just start out with a piece from the National Journal of June 21. The caption is `Fighting Over Taxes.' 
I quote: 
In the coming weeks Wall Street will be lobbying in support of all the new tax measures it likes, notably capital gains tax cuts, expansion of IRA's, and trying especially in the Senate to keep unwanted provisions out of the final bill. `We have to make sure that they are not offered on the floor to pay for some other provisions,' said Bruce E. Thompson, Jr., the head lobbyist of the Washington office of Merrill Lynch & Co. 
Madam President, I think this is the real question about this tax bill that is before us. The question is, who really has say in this process. 
Let me just go back to some charts--again, the Department of Treasury analysis. 
Looking at the House bill, the tax cuts disproportionately help those who need help the least. If you look at the share of tax cuts by family income, the top fifth get almost 70 percent of the benefit of the tax cuts, the top fifth. Then the fourth fifth gets 19 percent of the cuts; the third fifth, 9.2 percent; the second fifth, 2.4 percent; the bottom fifth, less than 1 percent. In other words, the bottom 40 percent of the population get a total of about 3 percent of the benefits of these tax breaks; the third fifth, the middle class, gets about 9.2 percent. Then you get to the top fifth, the top 20 percent, they get almost 70 percent of the breaks. So you have about 80 percent of the benefits going to the top 40 percent, and almost 70 percent of the benefits going to the top fifth. This is just unbelievable. 
Just look at the next chart. This shows the dollar amount that families get. 
Again, the source here is the Department of the Treasury, Office of Tax Analysis: If you have an income of $400,000 a year, or over, you will get about $7,000 a year in benefits under these tax proposals. Congratulations. If you earn $200,000 and up, you are going to get about $3,706. But on the other hand, if you are down here in the $30,000 to $40,000 range, you get $152. If you are $15,000 to $30,000, you get about $52. A buck a week. 
If you look at the tax cuts on the House side, and the way in which they are back loaded because of the capital gains cuts and the IRA's, you are talking about an erosion of revenue to the tune of about $950 billion by the time we get to the year 2017. It is not just the first 10 years that matters. It is what happens in the second 10 years that is tragic. This is not my analysis. It is the Joint Tax Committee and the Center on Budget & Policy Priorities. 
By the way, Bob Greenstein, who is the director of that Center--people can agree or disagree with some of Bob's views on different issues--but his data analysis is impeccable. Bob received the MacArthur award, the genius award, for the work he does. And you add to his reputation Congress' own Joint Tax Committee. 
On the one hand, Members of Congress say they are for deficit reduction, and then they go forward with this erosion of the revenue base via back-loaded tax cuts. That is bad enough. The second thing that is bad enough, or even worse, is what is going to be the tradeoff. We are going to have more and more people that are going to be 65 years of age and over, and more and more people that are 85 years of age and over. We will have the pressure of supporting them financially and covering their medical costs, and we will end up either running the deficits back up again, or we will be cutting into what little is left by the way of investment and education programs for our children and for our grandchildren. 
But what makes this really unconscionable is basically we are talking about tax cuts that go to people on the top. 
Let me quote a Washington Times headline from today: from Speaker Gingrich--`Gingrich Derides Democrats' Tax Cut Proposal As Welfare.' 
This is unbelievable. What the Speaker is worried about is that Democrats--I hope--are going to be on the floor of the Senate next week, and in the House, focusing on the welfare of working families. 
Let's not have a play on words here. This is not a debate about welfare policy. This is a debate about the welfare of working families and their children. That is not rhetoric. That is what this is all about. 
So, Madam President, I will suggest to you--and we will see what happens next week--that people in the country are going to be sorely disappointed and people in the country are just going to shake their heads in disbelief. And people in cafes in Minnesota and Maine, when they finally get a look at who is really going to get the benefits, are going to say, `Wait a minute. We thought you were talking about tax cuts for our hard-pressed families.' And they are going to find out that is not the case at all. 
Apparently, we made some progress in the Finance Committee last night, at least for some of the people who are in the $20,000 to $25,000 range who weren't going to be getting any child care credit because they received earned income tax credit. These are working poor people. At least now they're not going to be a 100-percent offset, and some of these families are going to be able to get some child care credits. 
But, Madam President, this still begs the question as to why in the world giving these families a benefit is even controversial. Don't we want to make sure that working families' children also get benefits? Don't we want to make sure that these tax cuts are not tilted and skewed toward the very top--the top fifth--of the population that gets the lion's share of all the benefits? Don't we want to target precious dollars toward middle-income people and toward working families? 
That is not what this legislation is all about. That is not what these tax cuts are all about. That is not what is going to be reported out on the floor of the Senate. 
Madam President, I just want to mention one other area that I know is near and dear to the Presiding Officer's heart. That is higher education. I want to be critical of Democrats and Republicans on this. I still say that we are making a mistake here by underreaching. If we are going to say that we are concerned about higher education not being affordable, and we are going to claim to focus on getting support for the people who need it most, how can we talk about tax credits that are not refundable? Nonrefundable HOPE tax credits mean that many of these families with incomes of $20,000 to $25,000 a year are not going to get anything because they don't have any tax liability. 
That is why the Pell grant is a far better way of getting help to the people who need it. The IRA's are great if you can afford to put the money in savings. We already have the tax incentives for working families to do that. They can't do any more. 
The problem for many people is they still struggle very hard to earn a decent living and to raise their children successfully. To raise your children successfully means to try to be able to send your kids to college or to a university. But so many struggling families just don't have any money to put into savings. 
So let's just not fool anybody here. We don't have, really, anything that I see in this tax cut, in this reconciliation bill, that as a matter of fact is going to make higher education affordable for those families that have had the most difficult time. We have had a flat 8 percent graduation rate for families with incomes under $20,000 a year since about 1979. That is scandalous. We ought to be making sure that those families are part of the American dream as well, and we ought to reach well into the $20,000 and $30,000 range of hard-pressed, middle-income working families. We are not doing that. The President's proposal does not do that and certainly the alternatives we have here do not represent a step forward. They represent a great leap backwards. 
Madam President, let me just finish up with a kind of appeal --I will have amendments next week which will be very specific, and we will have up or down votes on them--but right now, I want to make just a broad appeal. I am grateful for whatever improvements have been made in the Finance Committee. I thank all my colleagues for their work. They have made some improvements. However, like my good friend Jim Hightower likes to say, you can put an earring on a hog, but you still can't hide the ugliness. A couple of earrings don't make a hog beautiful. You can put a couple of earrings on this tax cut, this reconciliation bill, but you can't make it beautiful; you cannot hide the ugliness. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I have 3 more minutes to speak.

Mr. WELLSTONE. When you have a tax cut bill, a reconciliation bill that gives the vast majority of the benefits to those people at the very top and gives middle-income and working families the shaft, you don't have justice. You don't have a bill that represents expanding opportunities. And, as I said, fix it up, do your best, but, again, you can put an earring on a hog, but that won't hide the ugliness. You are not going to be able to hide it from people in the country. 
Next week we are going to have one heck of a debate. My appeal is that we work together here in this body. But my appeal also is to the President: I hope you will hold the line. During the last campaign the President talked about economic fairness. Boy, if there ever was a place to draw the line and have a debate, it is here. To Democrats, my colleagues, I hope you will come out here with an alternative. I hope we will be united behind it, and I hope we will stay strong. Because this piece of legislation is the exact opposite of what most folks mean by fairness. It is no wonder that most people in the country think there has been a hostile takeover of the government process. They know who has been in there lobbying, they know who is going to get the vast majority of the benefits, and they can see that it does not have a whole lot to do with them. That is the disconnect in American politics today. This reconciliation bill, this tax cut, represents a huge disconnect to middle-income and working families. It is an outrage.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall go on reading, then, this amendment, that whatever we do by way of this tax legislation `should meet a standard of fairness in its distributional impact on upper, middle and lower income taxpayers, and that any such legislation should not disproportionately benefit the highest income taxpayers.' 
Mr. President, I want colleagues to listen to this because it is my sense that there is going to be strong support for this. I will do everything I can as a Senator to hold my colleagues accountable for their support. 
Understand, I say to Democrats and Republicans alike, that if you vote for this, then what we need to do is look at what we are now discussing in the Finance Committee and what came out of the Ways and Means Committee. Look at the Finance Committee tax bill--it is quite unbelievable--if you are at the top 1 percent of the population, making over $400,000 a year, you are going to get a break of a little bit over $7,000 a year. If you are in the top 20 percent of the population, and have an income of $200,000 a year and over, you will get a break of about $3,706. $200,000 and over, you get $3,706; $100,000 to $200,000 --we are not middle class yet, I remind my colleagues--you get $1,440; $75,000 to $100,000, 
you get $804. 
Now look what happens when we get to incomes of $75,000 and below, and more so when we get into the $40,000 to $50,000, $30,000 to $40,000, and $15,000 to $30,000 range. For these hard-pressed people--what do you get? A pittance. Low income families get a dollar a week, if that. 
Mr. President, we are talking about a tax bill that provides benefits to people in inverse relationship to need. The less you need, the more you get; the more you need, the more hard pressed you are, the more you are trying to provide for your family, trying to make a decent living and raise your children successfully, the less you get. This is a Robin-Hood-in-reverse policy. 
If I could turn to the next chart: here we see that the House bill is even worse, really, skewed in the favor of higher income Americans. The top 1 percent get $10,000; and then you get down to $40,000 to $50,000, $30,000 to 40,000--they get $167, or $300, or some similar tiny amount. 
So, Mr. President, we are giving $10,000 and $12,000 per year tax breaks to upper-income and wealthy people, and then hard-pressed people in the States of Wyoming or Minnesota are getting practically nothing. 
I say to my colleagues, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and maybe people don't want to debate it and maybe people don't want to vote against it. But if you vote for it and then you go and vote for this tax bill, you are going to have to come out with some other data that shows that this tax bill, in fact, is based on some standard of fairness. I haven't seen one shred of evidence to that effect. 
The next chart, Mr. President, reflects on the issue of deficit reduction. The chart is from the Joint Tax Committee and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--the first two charts were from the Department of the Treasury--and shows how the tax cuts are backloaded. Look at this. We are talking about an erosion of revenue between 2000 and 2017, to the tune of $950 billion. 
Mr. President, I have said it before on the floor of the Senate, there is an old Yiddish proverb: you can't dance at two weddings at the same time. You can't be talking about deficit reduction and say you want to invest in education and opportunities for all our citizens and you are for the children and at the same time vote for tax cuts that are going to explode the deficit, and the worst thing of all is provide the lion's share of the benefits to those people who are the wealthiest citizens. Maybe this is the difference between the Democrats and the Republicans. If so, I am pleased to have that division reflected in this vote on this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. 
There has been a lot of discussion about higher education. This is near and dear to my heart, because I really do believe that what we do here today has so much to do with whether or not our children or our grandchildren will do well in life and have access to a higher education. Again, coming over from the House Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Archer's higher education tax cuts are unbelievable. If you are in the top 1 percent of income earners--just take a look--you are getting up to $600 by way of a break. If you earn around $59,000, you are getting about $100. If you earn around $36,000, you may get $50, and below that, below $30,000 a year, you don't get anything at all. 
What kind of tax breaks are we talking about? I am telling you something, this tax bill makes the best argument for campaign finance reform I have ever seen since I have been here in the Senate. If you are a heavy hitter and you are well heeled and you are a player and you are over there in that tax committee room and you are lobbying every day, you are sure going to get your piece. But I have news for you working Americans. I am bringing this amendment to the floor today because it is a wake-up call. You are getting the short end of the stick. 
We have been talking about affordable higher education. I must say, even the President's proposal is far better than what we are looking at right now. 
I was speaking at Inver Hills Community College last Friday at graduation and talking to the president. It is wonderful. I love going to those graduations, because when you go to the community college graduations, always, at least one time, someone will yell out, `Way to go, grandma.' These are different students. They are not 19 years old. Many are older, many are hard pressed, many come from families with incomes under $30,000. 
If the tax credit isn't refundable, they are not going to get anything. So let's stop making claims that just do not hold up, and let's not brag about a tax bill that provides a huge amount of assistance to those people least in need. When it comes to those at the very top, this bill provides great breaks. When it comes to middle income, this bill gives a little bit, and when it comes to working families, low- and moderate-income families, this bill gives nothing. And this is called fairness? 
So, I say to my colleagues, if you vote for this amendment, 
then I certainly hope that you will not then separate your votes on the reconciliation bill next week from the words to which you have ascribed today. Some people sort of just pooh-pooh sense-of-the-Senate amendments, and they say it is just a wish list, it doesn't mean anything. I say you are on record. 
We have an important piece of legislation out here. I made this a sense-of-the-Senate. I am not talking all afternoon on this, but, by golly, we are focused on tax policy, and we are seeing a bill moving through these committees which is absolutely outrageous. It is no wonder that people in cafes in Minnesota and around the country think there has been a hostile takeover of the Government process. When they find out what this bill does and who benefits and who doesn't, they are going to be furious, and they are going to say the same thing they are saying already, which is, `Boy, I tell you something, we're locked out. Those folks in the Congress, they do a heck of a good job of responding to the well heeled, but they sure don't do a very good job of responding to our families.' 
According to the Treasury Department, on June 17, just look at where we are heading right over here in the Senate Finance Committee. Sixty-five-point-five percent of the benefits of these tax proposals go to earners in the top 20 percent; 10 percent goes to those making $50,000 or under; 5 percent goes to families making between $40,000 and $50,000; 3 percent goes to those making between $30,000 and $40,000; and 1.8 percent goes to families between $15,000 and $30,000 a year. I am actually surprised that they even got 1.8 percent. And the bottom of wage-earners? Nothing. If you earn below $15,000 a year, you get nothing. 
Mr. President, again I say to my colleagues, if you vote for this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that is great, but I don't think you are going to then be able to vote for what is coming out of the Finance Committee or what is coming out of the Ways and Means Committee, unless you come out here with other data, unless you come out here with another analysis as to what the distributional effects are. 
If this sense-of-the-Senate is adopted--and I think it will be, or I hope it will be--then I will come out with a tougher amendment on the Department of Defense bill. We are going to have some discussion today on the floor of the Senate about tax policy. I cannot believe the silence on the floor of the Senate. We are going to have a debate about this. This isn't just going to move through next week quickly and silently, as we do with reconciliation bills. People in the country have a right to know how this is going to affect them, who exactly is making the decisions, who exactly is going to benefit, and who exactly gets the short end of the stick. Working families, you get the short end of the stick. Don't you for a moment let anybody tell you that you and your children are getting a heck of a lot of assistance. You are not. But, by golly, if you are wealthy and at the very top, you are going to get a lot by way of assistance.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will read a brief relevant section: 
The Republican plan would cut the top tax rate on capital gains from 28 percent to 18 percent and phase in indexing of gains for inflation. 
I believe that is not going to be done on the Senate side, and that is an improvement. 
These and other tax changes would reduce Government's revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. Given bipartisan obsession with budget balance, the revenue cuts would translate directly into cuts in public outlay. 
That is another way we can do it with the erosion of revenue, either the deficit explodes or we make further cuts in health care and education. 
Supposedly, capital gains cuts will help the economy grow. With investment offering greater after-tax rewards, people will save more, invest more and be freer to shift assets to more efficient investments. All this in turn will make the economy more productive. 
But, Mr. President, it is not like people's stockholdings are not doing well. 
Stock values have doubled in two years, while inflation has gone up less than 6 percent. Taxpayers with serious money in the market are crying all the way to the bank. 
Who are we trying to help here? Wall Street investors and bondholders are doing just great. They are doing fine. I think the real issue is political power. The real issue is political power. Who has the say? Who are the well-heeled? Who are the folks who are well represented? But working families and their children get the short end of the stick.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I quote: 
The bill would lower the top capital-gains tax rate, now 28 percent, to 10 percent for taxpayers with incomes below $41,200 and to 20 percent for those who were better off. 
The main beneficiaries of the 10 percent rate, the tax experts said, would not be middle-income taxpayers selling a modest amount of mutual funds. Instead, it would be wealthy families who were selling stock to pay for their children's tuition. They could cut the taxes in half by giving their appreciated stock to their children and having the children sell it, rather than selling it themselves and paying the higher tax because of their higher income. 
That is not the only instance in which the bill would give a better tax break to affluent people sending their children to college than it would give to taxpayers who were less well off. 
Well, Mr. President, this happens every way you look at it. 
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities talks about the children's tax credit. I don't know what is going to happen. I understand Chairman Archer and the Republicans are changing their minds. Good. The more we speak out, the better chance we have of other people changing their minds. That is why I am on the floor today. 
The Senate did an analysis based on data from the Congressional Budget Office that show that the child credit, given where it was heading, where EITC is essentially used to offset it, that there are 28 million children, 2 of every 5, who will receive no child tax credit because their incomes would not be high enough to qualify. Because their incomes won't be high enough to qualify? Unbelievable. 
You have a tax bill that is going to give a child tax credit, all in the name of helping families, but not if you are in the bottom 40 percent of the population. Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. 
Let me just simply go back to this amendment, because I have been here now long enough to realize what I think is happening, and I just want to be very honest with my colleagues, all of whom I appreciate whether or not we agree or disagree on other things. I bring this amendment to the floor to essentially sound the alarm, because we have tax bills that are absolutely unbelievable. There is no standard of fairness. 
Ninety-nine percent of the people in any cafe in any of our States would say, `What? No, can't be; it can't be. We were thinking about tax cuts that would provide us with some relief. You mean, this is going to people with incomes over $400,000 a year and over $200,000 a year, and they get the lion's share of the benefits and hardly anything comes to us, those of us where both are working and we are making $35,000 a year? Say what? No, can't be, Senator Wellstone.' 
Well, it is. 
Or families are going to be saying in Minnesota, `Wait a minute, I heard higher education was going to be more affordable. Wait a minute, you are saying to me now basically folks with IRA's are going to get the breaks and the breaks will mainly go to high-income people? And, by the way, the tax credits aren't going to be refundable, so if we are making $28,000 a year we'll be cut out?' I meet these students all the time at community colleges. You have a woman or a man, she is 40, he is 45, they are going back to school, but their income is $28,000. They are not going to get a thing, hardly a thing. People are going to say, `What? That's not what we understood was going to be the case.' 
So, I ask my colleagues to bring out other data, other charts--I would be delighted for them to do so. I have about 2 minutes remaining. Let me read this again-- 
It is the sense of the Senate that any tax legislation enacted-- 
Just for staff who are listening or colleagues listening-- by the Congress this year should meet a standard of fairness in its distributional impact on upper, middle and lower  income taxpayers * * * 
By the way, I don't think anybody in the Congress will say middle-income taxpayers are $250,000 a year. We all know what we are talking about here: and that any such legislation should not disproportionately benefit the highest income taxpayers. 
If my colleagues vote for this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, I will be delighted. Then I will come back with a slightly tougher one on the next bill, and if I get a strong vote for that, I will be delighted as well. But I want to tell you something, sense of the Senate or not, you are on record. You are on record and people in the country are going to be taking a close look at what we are about, and they are going to ask the question whether this tax relief is going to us or is it basically going to the same folks that all too often are the ones who always get the lion's share of the benefits. 
This is all about political power, who decides, who benefits and who sacrifices. The folks who are benefiting are at the very top of the economic ladder, and the folks who are really paying the price are the people most in need of the assistance. 
So, we will have this vote later on. Maybe people may vote against it, in which case you don't agree with this proposition. If you vote for it, don't think that your vote is just symbolic. I will have a tougher amendment on the next bill and all next week, any way I can, I will be talking about what you are on record for and how that is opposed to what is coming out of these tax committees. 
Mr. President, I assume Democrats are going to have an alternative, in which case it will be good, because then people will say there are differences between the parties and those differences matter. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.

The amendment accomplishes a number of things, including funding arrears to the United Nations within 2 years and fully funding fiscal year 1998 U.S. regular and peacekeeping dues to the United Nations. The full funding for fiscal year 1998 is important in that it will help ensure that the United States does not perpetuate U.S. arrears by not meeting current U.S. obligations to the United Nations. 
But as commendable and desirable as these provisions are, what I believe is most important is Senator Lugar's proposal to strip from S. 903 some 38 unilaterally imposed benchmarks or conditions that the United Nations would have to meet before we fully pay the debts we acknowledge we owe the organization. Included in these benchmarks are a permanent cut in our annual dues from 25 percent to 20 percent of the regular U.N. budget and from 31 percent to 25 percent of the peacekeeping budget. 
When I first joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was asked by a ranking State Department official what my position was on U.S. arrears to the United Nations. I said my position could be summed up in two-words: `pay up.' At the time I had no inkling that the majority of my colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee would agree that our decision to finally pay up should be contingent on the U.N complying with numerous U.S. conditions. And the conditions contained in S. 903 provide for payment of arrears over a 3-year period, with new conditions imposed each of the 3 years--conditions that the United Nations will have to meet in exchange for U.S. payments. To other nations, including some of our allies, this formula is likely to be viewed as being tantamount to blackmail on the installment plan. Moreover, if implemented there is no question it would greatly weaken the United Nations and undermine our leadership role in the world body. 
What would happen to the United Nations if other member States were to follow suit and impose some of the same provisions contained in this bill as conditions for paying their arrears? Thus, they might refuse to pay their back dues and assessments until the United Nations agreed to make reductions they specify in their assessed rate for the U.N. budget and share of contributions to peacekeeping operations. Or they might condition repayment to specific reductions in the U.N. staff, reduced U.N job vacancy rates, or 
even providing their national counterparts to our GAO with access to U.N. financial data so that they may audit the U.N. books. 
Is there any doubt that we would be enraged if the national legislature of any other member state were to mandate that the United Nations jump through a series of hoops before that state pays its debts to the United Nations? And we would have a right to be enraged, not only because our own dues and assessments might consequently be increased. But also because U.N. compliance with such a unilateral diktat could well lead to the organization's collapse. No international organization can be viable if its members have the power to unilaterally determine what they owe the organization, the conditions under which repayment should be made, and what their future financial obligations should be. 
As Senator Lugar has pointed out, only 5 percent, some $54 million, of the $1.021 billion we acknowledge we owe is actually owed to the United Nations. It is important to note that the single largest portion of our arrears, almost two-thirds, is owed to countries who contributed troops to peacekeeping operations which the U.S. backed in the U.N. Security Council. In most cases these were operations in which the United States refrained from participating with our own forces. The bulk of this peacekeeping debt is owed to our NATO allies, with the United Nations merely serving as a conduit to reimburse those countries who supported peacekeeping operations with troops and equipment. 
There is no doubt that international peacekeeping eases our burden because other nations share the costs and risks. In fact, the United States will gain $107 million in reimbursements for U.N. peacekeeping costs, which we will credit against our U.N. debt obligations. 
In effect, by withholding our debt payments and making repayment contingent on a host of conditions, we've imposed a double whammy on some of our closest allies. We have yet to pay them what we owe for the costs of peacekeeping operations they carried out which we had deemed to be in our national interest. And by unilaterally reducing our own future obligations to the United Nations as a condition of paying our arrears, our NATO allies will wind up paying more for peacekeeping operations and the U.N. budget. To me, this seems like a sure-fire formula for undermining our relations with our NATO partners. 
Mr. President, I believe it is important to stress that the Lugar amendment enjoys strong and broad support. Among the backers is the Emergency Coalition for U.S. Financial Support of the United Nations which includes all the former Secretaries of State, and over 100 business, labor, humanitarian, faith-based, and civic organizations. Moreover, the premises of the Lugar amendments are consistent with the views of the American public. For example, a nationwide poll last year found that almost two-thirds of Americans believe the United States `should always pay its full dues to the United Nations on schedule.' 
Americans have long believed in having `a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.' I hope my colleagues will agree with me that imposing unilateral, take it-or-leave it conditions on the United Nations hardly reflects `a decent respect for the opinions of mankind.' Therefore, I urge my colleagues to strongly back the Lugar amendment.  
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I join my colleague today, Senator Kerry, as well as Senators Glenn, Biden, and Leahy, in introducing the Clean Money Clean Elections Act of 1997. 
One of the most important ethical issues of this Congress is the way in which money has come to dominate politics. That is why we are introducing this legislation to address what has become a systemic corruption, a corruption which results from the sharp disparity of power between those who are able to mobilize and invest large amounts of campaign cash on one hand, and ordinary citizens on the other. Our proposal would provide sweeping and simple reform. It would sever the direct connection between big-money special interests and Senate candidates. 
American democracy needs elections, not auctions. But our current campaign finance system locks most citizens out of participation. Most citizens don't believe they can be players when it comes to the really important policy decisions that affect their lives. They don't believe they have a real voice. They are not even sure that their vote counts for much. 
At the same time, our current system makes sure that big givers and heavy hitters always have a seat at the table. That is why so many believe, with reason, that we have a pseudo-democracy, not authentic democracy. They see the subversion of democracy, the loss of the principle of one-person, one-vote. They are losing faith in the idea that Government is supposed to be on their side. 
In this system, what's legal is a scandal. 
To address this mix of money and politics which is corrupting our politics, my colleagues and I are proposing an approach to reform called `Clean Money, Clean Elections.' I believe our proposal is ambitious and innovative. I am sure that it is needed. 
Citizens around the country are turning up the heat in a push for this vision of real reform. Voters in Maine chose this approach to the finance of election campaigns. And now legislators and the Governor in Vermont have decided to pursue it. A number of States will be considering the Clean Money Clean Elections approach during the coming months. I strongly endorse these actions at the State level. And I hope that citizens around the country will continue to keep comprehensive campaign finance reform at the front of the Nation's political agenda. 
This Congress needs pressure. It needs a jolt. What it needs is a counterbalancing pressure to ensure that the voices who believe in reform are heard above the voices of those who march on Washington every day--the monied interests who far too often determine what issues are on the table in American politics, and who far too often shape the outcomes within that agenda. The American people should turn up the heat. This is the only way reform will happen. 
Reform can happen. When we passed lobby reform and a gift ban during the last Congress, despite great resistance, it was because Members of Congress were forced to vote, with the people of America watching. Now, we plan to take this proposal to the American people--State by State, townhall by townhall, to build the support needed to enact true reform. The people are watching. When the time comes to vote, Members of Congress will need to vote the right way. 
We all know that campaigns currently cost far too much money. Our bill will set a voluntary spending limit on the campaigns of clean money candidates. The spending limit is based on a formula tied to each State's voting-age population. We have adopted the McCain-Feingold bill's formula, except that we subtract 20 percent from the upper limit. We subtract 20 percent because that is approximately the amount most candidates now spend to raise money. Under our bill they won't have to spend that time and money to raise money. In Minnesota, the clean money amount, which also is the spending limit for a clean money candidate, will be about $1.14 million for the general election. In a contested primary, the amount will be about $764,000. That adds up to a 
total clean money amount of $1.9 million in Minnesota for a clean money Senate candidate. 
Less than $2 million is enough in Minnesota: 
If we also ban soft money to the parties, which this bill does; and if we close loopholes on independent expenditures and so-called `issue' ads which are really election ads, which this bill does. 
Our provisions on these items are similar to those in S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill, a bill which I am proud to have co-authored. I continue to support that bill. 
But we really need to go further. The Clean Money Clean Elections Act does so. It takes special-interest money out of campaigns. It gives the country's electoral system back to the people. 
Americans know that the current campaign finance system works for the monied special interests, not for them. They're paying too much now for our elections. Too much in special favors, whether it's tax breaks for huge companies, tobacco politics that threaten the health of children, unneeded spending, and misdirected national policy. These result in the systemic corruption that is enshrined in our present system of financing campaigns. That's why we need to change it. 
We need to take the special interest money out, and replace it with Clean Money Campaigns. Clean Money Campaigns would: 
Level the playing field for non-incumbents, including those who are not major party candidates; allow candidates to focus on seeking office and serving the public once in office, rather than spending an inordinate amount of time raising money; and utilize free media time to allow candidates to get their message out. 
Candidates who meet our bill's rigorous standard for showing serious public support will receive full public financing in contested primary and general elections. They will receive the full amount of the spending limit for their State. In Minnesota, to qualify as a clean money candidate, a major-party candidate would have to gather about 8,500 signatures, each accompanied by a $5 check to the Senate Election Fund. That is a tough standard of seriousness, but it is realistic. A candidate who is not seeking the nomination of, or who has not received the nomination of, a major party can also receive clean money financing for his or her campaign. That candidate must gather 150 percent of the qualifying contributions that a major party candidate needs to gather in the same State. Again, it requires that a candidate demonstrate genuinely broad support, but it is an achievable threshold. 
The American people can no longer afford what has been called `The Best Congress Money Can Buy.' That is why we have to take special-interest money out of campaigns. The roughly $160 million of annual cost of Senate elections under our proposal can be easily offset with reductions in current corporate welfare or other unneeded expenditures. 
Are Americans willing to fight for and put in the budget clean elections that really belong to them--that belong to the people? I believe they are. So do the many groups endorsing our bill: Public Campaign, Public Citizen, League of Women Voters, Citizen Action, USPIRG, National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, United Church of Christ, Office for Church and Society. Still other organizations support our approach, even if they do not endorse specific pieces of legislation. 
Mr. President, the Senate needs to consider comprehensive campaign finance reform soon--before we leave this summer. This bill shows us the direction to go. It is workable, and it is needed. I urge my colleagues who have not yet read the bill to consider cosponsoring it. I am hopeful that this bill and a similar proposal to be introduced during the coming weeks in the House of Representatives will contribute to real momentum for genuine reform during this Congress. 
Mr. President, let me say that I am pleased to introduce this bill today with my colleagues, Senators Kerry, Glenn, Biden, and Leahy. And I am confident there will be other Senators in the future who support this approach to reform. 
There are other worthy and important efforts going on here, the McCain-Feingold bill being one of them, to try to reduce the amount of money that is flowing in and affecting the politics of our country. I personally think, and I think the majority of people in this country agree, that this is a core issue, a core problem. Many things which could happen here don't happen because they get trumped by money, big money in politics. 
The ethical issue of our time is the way money has come to dominate politics. If you believe each person should count as one, and no more than one, which is the standard of representative democracy, that is a harsh verdict. 
I do think we have corruption, but I don't like bashing colleagues. I am not talking about individual colleagues. The vast majority of Senators and Representatives with whom I serve--Democrats and Republicans alike--believe in public service and do their very best to serve people. Still, there is a systemic corruption. We have such a huge imbalance between those people at the top who have economic resources and access to power and the vast majority of people who just feel locked out. 
Mr. President, I have a friend--Jim Hightower, who used to be Agriculture Commissioner in Texas. He has a wonderful way of putting things. Jim Hightower says you don't have to be who's who to know what's what. The what's what is that a lot of people in the country think there has been a hostile takeover of our electoral and Government processes by big money interests. Many people don't feel a part of this system any longer. When that is the case, there is not anything more important that can be done than to pass a reform bill. 
The goals of the clean money/clean elections bill are simple: dramatically reduce the amount of money that is spent, get the interested dollars and private money out, have a level playing field, try to eliminate, or come as possible to eliminating special interest access, have real elections as opposed to auctions, don't have Senators spending so much of their time raising money, instead they should be trying to be good legislators. I think people want to turn this system, which they think is a rotten system, not upside down, it is upside down now, but right side up. 
What our bill does, with agreed-upon spending limits, so candidates don't have to go out and raise all the private money, is we break the link between private money and our votes and work as legislators. Under our bill, the money is no longer interested money. We dramatically reduce spending by setting voluntary limits, then campaign spending by clean money candidates comes from this Senate election fund. We tighten the definition when it comes to independent expenditures. And we do the same for issue advocacy ads, some of which are barely disguised campaign ads. Our bill includes free broadcast time. If you really want to have a system where the vast majority of the people feel like they can be a part of it, we are going to have to take this journey. 
Mr. President, two final points. If we can pass McCain-Feingold, that moves our country forward, that would be an important step. But this piece of legislation, which won't pass immediately, has a lot of energy behind it, too. We introduce it as part of the debate, as part of the energy behind reform. I have met with the people who were involved in the Maine effort, and they passed a clean effort option. I met with legislators and a lot of people in Vermont, and they are going to pass it. I met with people in the Midwest. There is a lot of energy in the Midwest and New England. It may be States which pass this kind of reform at first. You are going to see a lot of pressure on people here from the grassroots. 
We need to have a galvanized public. We are going to have to have an external jolt to this Congress to pass a reform bill, but there is no more important thing that we can do than to pass such a reform bill. This clean money/clean elections bill would represent an enormous step forward for our country, toward real elections as opposed to auctions, toward authentic democracy as opposed to pseudo democracy, toward a Government of, by and for the people, not of, by and for those who have the wealth and economic resources. 
I think people in this country yearn for a political process they can believe in. They yearn for reform, and I don't agree with one person who says, `Look, people don't seem to care that much.' People care deeply, they care desperately, they care about issues that affect themselves and their families. They have hopes for themselves and their families and their communities, but right now I think most people believe that they there is not a heck of a lot they can do on the issues that are most important to them, because our political process has essentially been dominated by big money, not people's needs. 
Mr. President, we have given people entirely too much justification for that point of view. We have to make some big changes. Some of us are going to be fighting hard on the floor for reform. I think there will be plenty of pressure building around the country. It will be a tough fight, but I cannot think of a more important fight as a Senator from Minnesota. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr BIDEN. Mr. President, the single most significant thing we can do in Congress today is to reform the way we fund political campaigns in this country. I have been saying it for 24 years now, and while some things are better than they used to be--large amounts of cash are no longer being passed under the table in brown paper bags--many things are worse--large checks are being passed over the table, or in the Chamber of the House of Representatives, in the clear light of day. But, regardless of what's better and what's worse, the fundamental problem, in my view, remains. 
That problem will not be fixed by tinkering at the edges, or making a small reform here and a small reform there--because the fundamental problem is not a flaw in the system's construction. The fundamental problem is the system itself--a system where the amount of private money is out of control and is not susceptible to be controlled in the public interest. Until we get private money completely out of the system, we will not completely reform the system. 
That is why, Mr. President, I have been pushing for public funding of congressional campaigns for my entire career, and that is why I am pleased today to join several of my colleagues in introducing the Clean Money, Clean Elections Act. 
When I first came to the United States Senate, 24 years ago, in speeches on this floor and in testimony before the Rules Committee, I outlined three principles of a better system. All three are contained in this important proposal. 
First and foremost, we must have a system of public funding. Let me explain why that is so crucial. When they asked Willy Sutton why he robbed banks, he said that was where the money was. Politicians do not rob banks, but they, like Willy Sutton, must go where the money is. You will not get very far in this business by asking for contributions from people who do not have money. So, inevitably, people running for office find themselves on the doorsteps of the wealthy and the special interests. Or, they are wealthy enough to fund their own campaigns. 
The result is that other old saying--he who pays the piper calls the tune. Those who pay the bills ultimately, when you get right down to it, are the ones who decide who runs for office. And, they are the ones, at least in the mind of the public, to whom elected officials are beholden. 
No matter what other reforms you enact, unless you get private money out of the system, that is the way it will continue. I submit that it would be better to let the American people decide--on the merits--who runs for office. And, I submit that it would be far better for America to make sure that elected officials are beholden to no one but the people who elected them. 
Second, we need to level the playing field between incumbents and challengers. I have, Mr. President, been both an incumbent and a challenger. And, I can tell you that being an incumbent has its disadvantages. But, the biggest advantage of incumbency is in the money chase. It is such an advantage that if I were looking out only for my own self-interest, I would not support this proposal. I do pretty well in raising money, and the thought that my opponent would have the same amount of money as I do is not exactly an appealing notion. 
But, there is something much bigger at stake here than my own electoral future. What is at stake is nothing less than a healthy, vibrant democracy. What is at stake is whether election to office will be based on the merits of the individuals, not on who is the best fundraiser. 
Third, we need to limit the overall amount of money that can be spent in political campaigns. Back in 1976, all candidates for all congressional races--Senate and House--spent $99 million in the general election. In 1996, all candidates for Congress in the general election spent over $626 million--more than six times as much. In just the last 4 years, the total amount of money given to political parties has increased 73 percent--in just the last 4 years. 
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has ruled--in what is, in my view, a wrong decision, but one that we are bound by--that spending money is the same thing as speech. Thus, Congress cannot limit spending in political campaigns, unless a candidate is offered some benefit in return for voluntarily agreeing to a spending limit. 
Enter the `Clean Money, Clean Elections Act.' This significant proposal that we are introducing today would, as I said a moment ago, meet the three principles I just outlined. It would limit spending in campaigns--in a constitutional way--by providing public funding and free media time to candidates who agreed to abide by those limits. And, it would be full public funding for both challengers and incumbents--so that private money is eliminated from the system and so that both challengers and incumbents are on the same level playing field. 
I am not so naive, Mr. President, to believe this bill is going to pass today--or even without a fight. I have been down this road too many times before. Too many special interests have too many vested interests in the status quo. But, if we are to reverse the tide of cynicism and mistrust that surrounds political campaigns--and even our institutions of government--then we must change the system so that the only interests we are all concerned about are the interests of the American people.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I don't have any rehearsed remarks. I am trying to think exactly what to say. I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota, both Senators from North Dakota, and the Senators from South Dakota. It has been a pleasure to work with you. 
I certainly want to thank the minority leader, Senator Daschle, who has done a great job. 
Jim English, I am going to say the same thing about you. I want to thank Jim for just incredible work. Larry Stein has been phenomenal as well. 
I would like to thank Sarah Neimeyer who has worked with me in my office. 
We have had so much help. Senator Byrd, thank you so much for your support. And I would like to thank my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their support. 
Finally, we have come together. Finally we are going to pass a disaster relief bill. Mr. President, all I can say right now is that this has been a long and sometimes bitter fight. I wish it had not been such a long, protracted fight. I wish it had not been a bitter fight. I do not think I am in the mood at all to point fingers today. I think it is better just to say to everybody here, we finally have come together. 
Senator Stevens, thank you for your help. And I think that what matters is not who wins or who loses here in the Senate or in the House. I don't really care. I don't think it's very important. But I do think the people back in Minnesota and the Dakotas win, and that does matter a great deal to me. People are trying to get on with their lives. They are trying to rebuild their lives. And they need the certainty. They need the certainty of knowing whether or not this assistance is going to be available. I think, finally, today, as a Senator from Minnesota, I can look people in the eyes, go back home and meet with people and say, `This is passed, the help is going to be forthcoming. I hope and pray that this will help you and this will help your children and this will help your families.' 
I am proud of my colleagues on this side of the aisle. I thank colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their support now. Finally, we are together. I am proud of my Democratic colleagues because I think we did the right thing. I think we used the rules of the Senate. The expert--I have to get his attention--the expert who knows more than the other 99 Senators combined is Senator Byrd. 
Senator Byrd, I want to get your attention. You do not have to respond. I would say I am proud of my colleagues, I am proud of the Democrats. I said one of the things I am most proud of is I think we did the right thing to be out here fighting for people, and I think it was important to use the rules of the Senate to fight for people. I was saying that you are, of course, the master teacher to all of us. Again, I thank you for what you have taught us. 
It feels good to be able to know the process and use the rules, if you can use your leverage to fight for people. I think we did that. But I think most important of all, it is the people who will benefit. We have come together, finally, finally. I think the U.S. Senate, and I hope the House of Representatives and therefore the Congress, will look good to people after what has been a terrible period of time. I do not believe the last several weeks have been a good several weeks for the Congress. They have not built up a lot of respect for our institution. People have not been able to understand the delay. I think, in a way, this is an important victory for people in our States and it is also, I think, a very good thing that finally, finally the U.S. Senate has come through for people. 
Mr. President, I have spoken many, many, many, many hours, have given enough speeches to probably deafen all of my colleagues and I do not need to say any more. I am so pleased, I feel so good that we finally are able to pass this bill and we are finally going to be able to help people--really good people who really need the help. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues today as an original cosponsor of the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997. I thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond, as well as Senators Domenici and Kerry, for their leadership on this issue. 
As a member of the Small Business Committee, I have followed the success of the women's business demonstration sites--two of which are in Minnesota. I would like to note the effectiveness and good work of those two organizations: Women in New Development, or WIND, of Bemidji, MI, and the Women's Business Center, which is operated in association with the White Earth Reservation Tribal Council in Mahnomen, MI. 
This program, and these centers, fill a crucial need in many communities across the country. They deliver needed technical assistance, and they ultimately help provide tremendous economic benefits. 
I recently received a letter from Mary Turner, director of the White Earth center. She pointed out that her center and others operated through the program are committed to delivering services aimed at promoting self-sufficiency, and which are `as diverse as the women we serve--women of color, women on public assistance moving on to self-employment, rural and urban women, and women starting home-based businesses.' 
Mr. President, the bill will reauthorize the women's demonstration sites, increasing the program's annual funding and authorizing demonstration sites to receive funding for 5 years rather than the current 3 years. I look forward to working with the chairman and other members of our committee to include this measure as part of our broader reauthorization of SBA programs.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I shall be brief today. Let me just build on the comments of my colleague from North Dakota. 
It is my fervent hope, and it is not an exaggeration to say prayer, that when I go home this weekend, back to Minnesota, I 
will be able to say to people, `Congress has acted, and we have passed a disaster relief bill that will provide you with help so that you can begin the process of rebuilding your lives.' That is what people are asking for. No more than that. All of us, if we had been flooded out or if we had been faced with some kind of disaster like this, would also be hoping to get the same kind of help. 
Madam President, I, too, last night had a chance to talk to people around the country on radio and television and whatnot. I think that the goal of yesterday and today, because the Senate is not going to really be back conducting business as usual until we get this disaster relief bill passed--that is our commitment, that is how we fight for people in our States--but I think really the goal is to just press and press and press and keep fighting for people, but more with the focus on what we can do as opposed to finger pointing and getting personal. 
I have talked to enough Republican colleagues on the majority side who, I believe, even if we don't agree on every issue, want to come together, and I hope it will happen. I think it should happen this week. 
I think that this particular form of gridlock is not working well for this Congress, and I don't think people around the country understand how it can be that on a bill which is to provide emergency assistance to people, you get all sorts of other measures dealing with how the Census Bureau does its work or dealing with debates about appropriations bills and the budget and all the rest. I think most people believe that when it comes to disaster relief, you should try and get it to people and keep off the extraneous measures that are so controversial. 
There are a lot of good people here on both sides of the aisle. I was asked last night many, many times, especially from Minnesota, `Do you think there is going to be some agreement?' And I said, `I cannot believe there won't be.' 
I just think it is going to happen. It has to happen. 
The only appeal I would make to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that if, in fact, we are going to be talking about scaling back the disaster relief, I worry about it because we had a very clear definition of what it would take by way of emergency assistance--and I use those words carefully--to help people get back on their own two feet. This was really a good bipartisan effort. That is what we had. I really hope that my colleagues will understand that we are speaking and we are fighting and we are using our leverage as Senators in order to get the help to people back in our States. We are going to continue to do that until we, in fact, are able to get the job done. 
So my appeal to my colleagues is: Let's have an agreement; take the extraneous provisions off this bill. We can debate them separately. We can have an up-or-down vote, or if there is some alternative proposal that people have, great. Let's just try and get the help to people, and let's not delay it any further. 
I was asked by somebody back in Minnesota whether I really liked last night. I was on the first shift. I said, `Actually, not so much so. I would rather be doing it on the floor of the Senate. I would rather be in a markup in committee. But I, as a Senator, will do everything I can to fight hard for people in Minnesota.' 
I think from talking to colleagues in the majority party, we are going to reach agreement. I believe that, I say to my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams. There has to be an agreement. That is what we have. We have to make that happen so all of us can go back to our States and say to people, `We wish this had not been delayed and delayed and delayed, but now, finally, a good bill is passed and we are going to get the help to you.' That is the goal, that should be the result, and I hope that that happens this week. That is my appeal to my colleagues. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the legislation that I am introducing today, the Medical Technology, Public Health and Innovation Act of 1997, takes a significant step toward improving the effectiveness, timeliness, and predictability of the FDA review process for medical devices. 
It is important that we improve the system for device approval in order to provide access to optimal technology to American consumers. We need to do this in order to promote the public health. We must also maintain protections for consumers, which are provided by the FDA's oversight of device manufacturing, development, and marketing. This legislation maintains those protections, while allowing for new efficiencies within the FDA. 
Over the past 2 years, I have met with numerous representatives of Minnesota's medical device industry, patient advocates, clinicians, and officials from the FDA, and have concluded that there are indeed steps that Congress should take to make the regulatory process for medical devices more efficient. Minnesotans want the FDA not only to protect public health, but also to promote public health. They want to know not only that new technologies will be safe, but that they will be available to them in a timely manner. Many of Minnesota's medical device manufacturers, researchers, clinicians, and patients in need of new and improved health care technology have become increasingly concerned about the regulatory environment at the FDA. While there have been some improvements in the device review process, there is still a need to increase communication between the FDA and industry; to decrease review times; and to have consistency in the review process. 
These needs are highlighted by the following example. A plant operated by a Minnesota-based device company was developing a new treatment for aortic aneurysms, which would require less invasive measures than are currently used. The company developed a protocol for testing its product, submitted the protocol to the FDA and was told by the reviewer that the protocol was invalid. The reviewer suggested a different protocol and the company followed it. Upon completion of the clinical trial, the company submitted the required data to the FDA. The original reviewer was on an extended leave of absence, so the data went to a different reviewer. The new reviewer deemed the protocol that was used to be invalid, and requested a new clinical trial, which basically followed the protocol that had been rejected by the first reviewer. The company was forced to do a new trial, which resulted in significant delays in getting this important product to market for patient use. I am certain that this is but one of many examples of inconsistently applied processes that delay the release of life-saving technology to 
the consumer. 
The technologies that the FDA regulates are changing rapidly. We cannot afford a regulatory system that is ill-equipped to speed these advances. As a result, both Congress and the Administration are reexamining the paradigms that have governed the FDA. Our challenge will be to define FDA's mission and scope of responsibility, as well as to give guidance on an appropriate balance between the risks and rewards of streamlining all aspects of how FDA does its job--including the approval process for breakthrough products. 
The legislation that I am introducing would begin to address these issues in three important ways: 
First, it would enable the FDA to adopt nationally and internationally recognized performance standards to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the device review process. Resource constraints and the time-consuming rulemaking process have precluded FDA promulgation of performance standards in the past. This legislation would allow the FDA, when appropriate, to simply adopt consensus standards that are already being used by most of the world and use those standards to assist in determining the safety and effectiveness of class III medical devices. The FDA could require additional data from a manufacturer relevant to an aspect of a device covered by an adopted performance standard if necessary to protect patient safety. Currently, the lack of clear performance standards for class III medical devices is a barrier to the improvement of the quality and timeliness of the premarket approval process. 
Second, it would improve communication between the industry and the FDA and the predictability of the review process. I believe that these two factors are extremely important. The bill includes provisions for meetings between the applicant and the FDA to ensure that applicants are promptly informed of any deficiencies in their application, that questions that can be answered easily would be addressed right away, and that applicants would be well informed about the status of their application. I believe that improving communication between the FDA and industry would result in greater compliance with regulations and that this will ultimately benefit consumers and patients. 
Third, the legislation would help the FDA focus its resources more appropriately. PMA supplements or 510(k)'s that relate only to changes that can be shown to not adversely affect the safety or effectiveness of the device would not require premarket approval or notification. Manufacturers would instead make information and data supporting the change part of the master record at the FDA. In addition the FDA would be able to exempt from premarket notification requirements those class II devices for which such requirements are unnecessary to ensure the public health without first having to go through the time consuming and bureaucratic process of reclassifying them to class I. The FDA would also have the option of relying on postmarket controls classifying devices. Enabling the FDA to focus its attention where the real risks are will not only streamline the approval process but also benefit consumers. 
I look forward to working with Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and my other colleagues on the Committee on the concepts included in my proposal. I will work vigorously to ensure that they are included in FDA legislation considered by the Senate this year. I look forward to continuing to work on these issues with Minnesotans. Clearly, there are actions that Congress can take to improve the FDA without sacrificing the assurance of safety that all Americans depend on.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I understand. But the reason I ask the majority leader this, since he is the majority leader, is that--and I put this in the form of a question. Is the majority leader aware--and I believe you are because I think that, agree or disagree on issues, you are very adept at sort of understanding the mood of people in Mississippi or for that matter in the country--is the majority leader aware that the people in our States are just getting sick and tired of it all and they do not understand all the debate about census and all the debate about continuing resolution and all the rest; they do 
not mind our having separate debate on that and they understand there are disagreements. They do not understand why we just cannot get a clean disaster relief bill to them. 
Can the majority leader commit to us that that is what we will do this week, get a clean disaster relief bill that will provide the assistance to people that need it and we will get it done this week? Can the majority leader make that commitment?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I will not hold the floor any longer. I just want to say to the majority leader I am a little troubled by the very lengthy explanation on the census count only because again I think the question that we have put to the majority leader is why not take that issue, around which there is disagreement, and debate it separately and why not take the issue of appropriations bills and the continuing resolution and debate it separately? But that is what we do not agree on. That is controversial. We can have an honest debate. Why link it to what should be a disaster relief bill----

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor and I think that other Senators will certainly be on the floor today, tomorrow, and as long as it takes, to speak about the disaster in my State and in the Dakotas and other States as well. I really come to the floor today to speak about a disaster, really a disaster on top of a disaster, because the disaster supplemental, which the Congress completed action on Thursday has still not been sent to the White House. There has been a disaster in our States and peoples lives have been devastated and they are waiting for additional Federal assistance. 
Mr. President, there is the disaster that people are faced with in Minnesota and the Dakotas of having been flooded out of their homes. I heard the Chaplain's prayer, that we resolve our impasse this week, and I thank him for his prayer. He is always very sincere and I hope all of us will listen to him because there has to be a way that we can get help to people who really are trying to rebuild their lives. 
I heard the mayor from Grand Forks, ND, this morning on one of the national network shows. She was saying that people are doing well at the community level because they really are helping each other out and trying to get back to their regular normal routines. But the one thing that is just continuing to really discourage and demoralize people is they still do not know whether or not there will be any additional Federal assistance. They are waiting week after week after week. 
Mr. President, I feel that the disaster, the other disaster, is the disaster here in the Congress. I spoke for a long time about this last week, and then said at the end of the week--and I am not really, by the way, looking forward to this--I said that I was prepared to come to the floor and speak for a long time again this week on the need for this emergency supplemental assistance. I do not know what the business of the Senate will be, but I am prepared to make sure that there is no business as usual in the Senate until we pass a clean supplemental that the President can sign. This has to be resolved. 
The particular disaster I want to speak to this afternoon, Mr. President, is the fact that some very controversial riders have been added to the supplemental. I think the people in Minnesota and the Dakotas are confused about this issue as well. They do not understand why some Members of the House and the Senate have insisted on adding these controversial riders. The purpose of this emergency disaster supplemental is to get much needed assistance out to these people who have been flooded out of their homes, not as a vehicle for unrelated issues like the continuing resolution and a provision relating to how the 2000 census will be done. By the way, the vast majority of people in Minnesota do not agree with that. 
So you have an effort to attach on what is called a continuing resolution, and then you have another amendment dealing with the way we take our census. Unrelated issues that the President said he would veto the bill over. By the way, when the President came out to visit North Dakota and South Dakota and Minnesota he said way back then when he looked at the devastation, `I just hope that people will keep this a clean bill. Please get the help to people. Do not put on other measures.' He always said he would veto it. 
Now, here is my question. Why hasn't the bill been sent to the White House yet? Here it is 12:10, today, Monday. To my knowledge, after this piece of legislation was to be sent to the President on Thursday of last week, it was not. First we have the House of Representatives going on vacation, Memorial Day recess, not even finishing the bill, not even finishing the bill. Then we finally got this passed on Thursday and now we find out that, now it is 12:10 Monday, they still have not sent the bill over to the President. This is unconscionable on top of unconscionable. They did not send the bill over to the President on Friday. They know he will veto it. What is the majority party doing? I would be quite prepared to debate anybody who wants to debate me on this. 
I do not agree, most of the people in Minnesota do not agree, with attaching unrelated issues to the supplemental. Keep the bill clean and get the help to people. 
Why hasn't the bill, that you know the President is going to veto, been sent to the President? You did not send it on Friday, you have not sent it on the weekend, and you have not even sent it come Monday. Some people can be incredibly generous with the suffering of others. Can anybody on the floor of the U.S. Senate who agrees with this decision not to even send the bill to the President--you know he will veto it, then it comes back here, then maybe we can have an agreement--can anybody justify that? Not for me, as a Senator from Minnesota, but for the people in East Grand Forks or Grand Forks or Warren or Ada, and a whole lot of other communities. 
Now, here is what I see, and this is just transparent:  
GOP sources alternately said they declined to send the disaster relief bill to the White House last week because either they wanted to give the President a chance to change his mind--which they were hoping to do through a weekend grassroots effort--or they were afraid Clinton would be able to monopolize the Sunday talk shows with his explanation of the expected veto. 
This is unbelievable. So here is what we have. Talk about talking out of two sides of your mouth. On the one hand people are saying, no, we do not want to send the bill to them because we really think that we will have a chance to change his mind. On the other hand, they say, no, we do not want to send a bill to him because we know he will veto it and we do not want him to be on Sunday shows talking about why he has vetoed it. 
Mr. President, can I suggest a third point to you, and that is, to people who are waiting for help, they do not understand these games. So I suggest to my colleagues on the majority side that it is time to send the bill to the President. You should not have delayed it on Friday. You should not be delaying it today. You know full well he will veto the bill. You are playing politics with people's lives. Get the bill back here, let us get to work and get the help to people. This has become really callous and really insensitive. 
Now here we have another explanation: 
House Majority leader Dick Armey, Texas, on Friday said Congress would not send Clinton the bill until today, even though the enrolling clerk had already finished work on it. `We think it's important that the President have a weekend to think this thing through,' he said. 
But Republicans also needed some time to think about what their plan will be if the measure is vetoed. 
GOP leaders were in `some turmoil' over what their game plan should be, as a GOP aide said. 
I put the emphasis on game. Stop playing games. I do not care whether it is Republicans or Democrats. I only care right now about the people in East Grand Forks, MN, and the people in the Dakotas and other communities in Minnesota. I do not care about these games. They know the President was going to veto it. This was just an effort to embarrass the President and it still has not been sent to him. You know what, colleagues? I do not know whether you have embarrassed the President or not, I do not think you have, but the point is you have embarrassed yourselves. You 
have embarrassed yourselves because everybody can see through this. If you want to provide disaster relief to people in an emergency supplemental, then we should understand it is an emergency supplemental bill. It is a disaster. People are waiting to rebuild their homes. People are waiting to rebuild their businesses. People are trying to find out whether or not they are going to be moved because they live in a floodplain or whether they will not be moved, and they cannot find out anything because of this unbelievable charade that is taking place here. 
I really do not understand it. I said last week that you have seen in the Dakotas and Minnesota a real sense of community. I see no sense of community here. I see no sense of community here. By the way, the vast majority of people would agree. 
I voted for the bill because I know how important it is to get help to people, but most people understand, and I can understand, what the President is doing. That as President, we have one President, he can say, look, give me a disaster relief bill, give me something that provides assistance to people. Do not mix up agendas. Do not impose your own agendas about how you want the census taken, do not impose your own agenda on whether you want money spent on education or not, do not impose your own agenda about public parks on a disaster relief bill for people. 
Now, if anybody wants to debate me, come on out. I am willing to stay here all afternoon. I would be willing to stay here all afternoon. If people don't come out, then I assume there is no debate for right now. I want to make it clear, Mr. President--very clear--and I would rather not do it and I am sure there will be help--but this week, until this disaster relief bill gets done, insofar as I am able to as the Senator from Minnesota, I will make sure that nothing else gets done here. To the extent that I can use every bit of knowledge that I have and leverage as a Senator to fight for people in Minnesota. 
I am going to make sure that the Senate is a deliberative body. If my colleagues think this process is geared to grind slowly, I am going to make sure that it is practically at a halt. 
This is outrageous, I say to the Chair, and he can't comment, and he may be in complete agreement with me on the substance. But, frankly, he would do the same thing, I think, probably if it was his own State. I mean, enough is enough. We are not going to do business as usual until this disaster relief bill is passed and we get assistance to people. I cannot, for a moment, understand why--and I doubt whether anybody from the majority party is going to come out and debate me--even though I don't agree with adding on other provisions, what I really have trouble understanding is why did they not send it to the President Friday? Why is it 12:20 on Monday and this still hasn't been sent to the President? Maybe delay is fine here, this is all abstract; but these are people's lives. I bet you that you ask the American people whether or not they think there is any defense for not sending the bill to the President, which you know is going to be vetoed, so you can then get down to work and finally pass a bill to get help to people who have been flooded out of their homes, I bet you 99 percent of the people in the country would say they don't understand this at all. And they should not understand it because there is simply nothing to defend. 
Mr. President, the Washington Post had an editorial on Sunday that starts out, `The President is right and Republicans are wrong about the disaster relief bill.' I will amend that. Frankly, at this point in time I agree, but I want to make it crystal clear that it should not be a partisan issue. Let's just get the help to people, just get a disaster relief bill with provisions in the bill that have to do with providing disaster relief, and pass it. That is what we should do. 
The Post editorial goes on to say: `Once again'--this is the language that is important--`in trying to use an appropriations bill as a forcing device, they have overreached. The amendments raise important issues that deserve to be debated on the merits and under the regular rules.' And then the conclusion--`An emergency bill to provide flood relief in the upper Midwest, and to pay some of the cost of the Bosnia peacekeeping mission, and to plug a few unexpected holes in the budget, is the wrong place to thrash out these other issues.' They were talking about right-of-way across Federal lands like this. They ought to back off. 
Here is an article written in the Pioneer Press by columnist Bill Salisbury. `Political Ping-Pong is a Pathetic Game.' That is quite a title. It starts out:  
The folks from Grand Forks and East Grand Forks were perplexed. They came here Wednesday to make yet another plea for Federal aid to help them recover from the spring flooding that wrecked their town. 
The group of 11 city officials and business leaders got patted on the head, assured that the national leaders feel their pain, and once again were promised that the money will soon be on its way. 
But if our Federal leaders had been completely honest with the group, they would have said something like: `You're going to get your flood relief sooner or later, but first we're going to play a little political ping-pong game, and we're going to use you folks as the ball.' 
I don't think anybody could have said it better. That is what is going on here, a political ping-pong game using people in our communities, in the Dakotas and in Minnesota, as the ball. It is a political ping-pong game using people in our communities as the ball. Well, I have news for you, colleagues. If that is your plan, don't plan on conducting any other business on the floor of the U.S. Senate, because there are going to be some of us out here and we are going to really fight hard this week. This has just become outrageous. 
Now, Mr. President, I could focus on all of the conditions and the lives of people in our communities, and I will do that as we move forward this week because I want to reserve my voice and my strength for when the majority party is trying to conduct its business so I can come out here and make sure that doesn't happen. But let me, one more time at least, bring this to the attention of the people in Minnesota and in the Dakotas and elsewhere in the country. 
What is going on here? You have a disaster, and the disaster is right here in the Congress. The disaster right here is the leader--the disaster right here is the failure of the majority party to move this bill forward. I am sorry, I don't know any other way to say it. There are three issues. You have people in pain and they need help. They have been waiting week after week after week, and they are being used as the ball in a political ping-pong game. 
Second issue. You have people here who decided on an oh-so-clever strategy and that strategy was to say, OK, here is a disaster relief bill. Everybody is going to be for providing help to people. So now we have these other agendas. Why don't we take our other political agendas having to do with the Census Bureau and their work, and public parks and roads, having to do with fights over budget priorities, and why don't we just put these provisions in this bill? That is a disaster. But now we have another disaster. The disaster I am talking about today is the disaster of the majority party and after loading on these provisions and knowing the President is going to veto the bill on Friday, not sending the bill over, and with the bogus argument made about how `we didn't want to because we thought maybe the President would change his mind,' or `actually, we didn't want to because, if we did, the President could get on the Sunday talk shows and make us look bad.' 
I don't really care whether those I work with look bad. I am worried about the people in my State. And now it is Monday and I have a question for the majority party: When are you going to send this bill to the President? What are you waiting for? How much more suffering does there have to be? How many more people do you want to demoralize? How much longer do you want people waiting? Where is your humanity? Send the bill over to the President, and then the President will veto the bill--he is going to veto the bill. Let's get to work and let's have some agreement. Let's have some compromise. Let's work things out, let's pass this bill, and let's pass this bill this week--tomorrow. 
But, Mr. President, we can't do anything until the majority party sends the bill over. I extend an invitation to any of my colleagues: Anytime you would like to come out on the U.S. Senate floor today and debate this question, please do, because it is a question that people in Minnesota and in the Dakotas have. If you would like to explain to the people in Minnesota and in the Dakotas on the floor of the U.S. Senate why you have not sent this bill to the President and why you are engaging in further delay, I would be very pleased for you to do so. I would be pleased. Actually, I think really you owe people that explanation. But I don't really think there is any argument that you can make. 
I will conclude this way this afternoon. I want my colleagues to know that I think it is indefensible and I don't blame you for not being out here because you can't defend it. I also want colleagues to know--those in support of this effort--that if we don't get to work on this and we don't pass this disaster relief 
bill, then I am prepared--and I am sure I will be joined by other colleagues as well because I heard Senator Daschle express a tremendous amount of indignation, along with both Senators from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad and Mr. Dorgan, and Senator Johnson from South Dakota, and we are prepared to fight very hard. 
So to my colleagues, whoever you are on the other side, whoever you are who made this decision not to even send this bill to the President, causing yet further delay and postponing the time when people will finally get help back in Minnesota, for some reason, I gather you think this is a clever strategy. I want you to know that people see through it and, in any case, I want you to know that until we get the work done here and we get the help to people, as a Senator from Minnesota, I am going to make sure that there will be no business as usual on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I may not always be able to get the floor, and it may not be all that easy, but I am quite convinced that this is what I should do, and I think other Senators will do the same thing. There comes a point in time when the only thing you can do, if you are trying to fight for people you represent, is come to the floor of the U.S. Senate and use your leverage. It looks like this is one of those times. 
Mr. President, let me conclude on a more positive note. I hope that my colleagues in the majority party will send this bill to the President today. I hope that it will come back to us right away, and I `hope and pray,' in the words of the Chaplain, that we will reach agreement and pass a disaster relief bill and that we will get help to people in Minnesota and in the Dakotas. 
Mr. President, these are good people, really good people. They have really been through a lot and they deserve our help. They don't deserve what we are doing to them right now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall be very brief. I had a chance to speak at some length about the need for disaster relief, and the need for emergency assistance for Minnesotans and the Dakotas. I want in less than 3 minutes to just say two things on the floor today. 
I would like to thank my colleagues. This started out in the hope that eventually it will end up as a bipartisan effort, and a lot of cooperation to get help to people, our neighbors. This is help that doesn't make everybody whole again, but at lease it gives people a chance to rebuild their lives. I hope that next week that is where this ends up. It started out on a very positive note, and I hope it will end up there. 
My second point is my colleague from North Dakota said he was disappointed. I am actually outraged. I think it is transparent. I think what is going on here is silly. 
There are some extraneous amendments on what should be a straight disaster relief bill--the way we collect census data; having to do with a continuing resolution; having to do with a budget resolution; and, if there is any kind of crisis a Government shutdown next fall; having to do with parks; you name it. This shouldn't be on this bill. 
I think what people know here--for some reason they think people in the country don't know it--that it is going to go to the President, the President is going to veto it, and it is going to be sent back. If it is an effort to embarrass the President, what is accomplished? Because when it gets sent back here, it is my fervent hope--and I believe this will happen--that these extraneous provisions will be taken off the bill. Then it will go back to the President, and then it will be signed. 
What has been accomplished? Is the point to embarrass the President? Is it just a game? 
I think we are going to be faced next week with one of two scenarios: Either it goes to the President, the President vetoes it--and everybody here knows it. But so do people back in our home States. They have intelligence. The President will veto it. Then it will come back here. And one of two things will happen: Either the bill will be stripped of these provisions that have nothing to do with the compelling need to get help to people, in which case, great. Thank you. Fine. But what was the point? 
Or that will not happen. And if that does not happen, then I will use every measure I know how to use as a Senator to stop this process here. I will do everything I can next week if we do not get a clean bill. Everything I can do to fight for the people in Minnesota I will do. So my hope is that this ends up on the positive note that it started out on because this is really not about a kind of strategy or tactics. It is just about getting help to people, and it is time. It is time to do the right thing. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Alaska. I say, I will try to stay under 10 so he will have time to speak. We had an agreement, those of us here earlier, if that would be OK. I will try to be quite brief, because we have been through a tremendous amount of this debate. 
Mr. President, first of all, let me just say that I appreciate the work of my colleagues. I know that my friend from New Jersey is committed to many of the same issues that I am. Whatever he does, he does in good faith. I think this budget agreement is a profound mistake. I have said I think it is a budget without a soul. I believe that very honestly and truthfully. 
I worry about so much of these cuts in capital gains and estate taxes going to the very top of the population, those that really do not need any assistance. Mr. President, really, I 
hate the tradeoff. I think it is a budget without a soul. And I think it is a profound mistake as a blueprint for our country for the following reasons. 
First, let me just start with the justice, just by raising the question of simple justice. In the last Congress, all in the name of deficit reduction, in the welfare bill we made huge cuts. Almost all of the cuts we made were targeted to low-income people. We made cuts totalling about $26 billion in food nutrition programs, food stamp programs. We do not restore any of that by way of a blueprint in this budget agreement. Then we made cuts in benefits for legal immigrants. 
Now, my colleague from New Jersey expressed some of his dismay about what is going on in the House side, in the House Ways and Means Committee. And I am quite in agreement with him. But I also just want to say I guess it is how you look at what is progress. 
The fact we restored some benefits for legal immigrants who are elderly and disabled, that is a good thing. And the fact that we restored some benefits for children, that is a good thing. But the fact of the matter is, if you are elderly, if you are 80 years old and you are not disabled, you are just old and poor, you are elderly and poor, your benefits were not restored in the budget agreement. I do not think that is enough. 
The fact of the matter is, for children who need food nutrition help or for elderly people, there was no restoration of funding for food nutrition programs. I do not think that is enough. Just as a matter of elementary fairness, we should have done much better. 
Mr. President, my colleagues have talked about our priorities. I guess I will be honest. I really understand that everybody votes in good conscience--and I know this budget agreement is going to get a good vote--but to have tax cuts, and I think my colleague from South Carolina is on the mark, to backload it, and with enormous revenue loss, the vast majority of the benefits going to those people who least need it, and what is the tradeoff? The tradeoff is what is unacceptable. This is a budget without a soul. 
Mr. President, we had an amendment that would have at least restored the $5 billion in investment in dilapidated school infrastructure. It was voted down. Why are we doing tax cuts for wealthy people and we are unwilling to invest in rebuilding our schools? 
Mr. President, I had an opportunity to go to Delta, MS. I visited a school. There is going to be some renovation now, but the ceiling was just practically caving in. The toilets were so decrepit, no child should ever have to go into a bathroom like this. You could not wash your hands after going to the bathroom because there was no running water in the sink. 
Now, that is not just in the South. These schools exist in the North and the Midwest and the West. These are the schools that too many of our children go to every day. And we did not invest one penny in rebuilding these schools for America's children, for some of the poorest children in America. I just think that this is unacceptable. And I think that this budget is a budget without a soul. 
Mr. President, we have talked so much about early childhood development, and we have been reading all these reports, all the neuroscience evidence. It is so compelling. The evidence is irreducible and irrefutable that if we do not invest in the nutrition--and I could talk about each one of these areas at great length--if we do not invest in the health care, if we do not invest in really good child care, really good child care, if we do not get it right for these children, that by age 3 they are not going to be ready for school and they will never be ready for life. 
Mr. President, with all due respect, what are we doing with cuts in capital gains and estate taxes, disproportionately going to the very top of the population, not even targeting that, and at the same time we make a pittance--I am sorry--a pittance of investment when it comes to the most critical years that affect whether children are going to do well in education, and those are in the very early years? 
We have White House conferences that talk about the development of the brain. We have speeches that are given. And yet, when it comes to where the rubber meets the road, when it comes to what are our priorities, we have a budget agreement here that does not make the investment in these children, does not make the investment in early childhood development, barely scratches the surface. It is not even a baby step. 
How much longer are these children going to have to wait? Everybody keeps talking about how we have to balance the budget for the sake of our children, our children's future. How about these children right now? And let us go ahead and balance the budget. But, first of all, why do we have these tax cuts that go to some of our wealthiest citizens? Why are we backloading it? Why are we eroding our revenue base? Why are we building here a straitjacket which will prevent us from making any of these investments in rebuilding rotting schools, in health and nutrition and child care for children at a very early age? 
This is a budget without a soul. I think this budget as a 
blueprint for our country is a profound mistake. It is a profound mistake for America. 
Mr. President, one final point because I promised to be brief. I could go on and on, but I have spoken on these issues before. 
There was a cut in this budget--and really, it was not very well publicized--in veterans health care, $2.3 or $2.7 billion. I just want to make it very clear to my colleagues that when we got briefings from the White House--and everywhere else nobody talked about this. We had a flat-line budget we were worried about, but $2.3 or $2.7 billion--a couple different figures are out there--over the next 5 years in veterans health care. 
Dr. Ken Kizer, who runs those health care programs, was out in Minnesota. He did not know about it. I do not think Secretary Jesse Brown knows about it. And I will tell you something, the veterans organizations, all of the organizations I know that I have had the honor of working with, are really indignant about this. They are angry not only about the substance of it, but also the manner in which it was done. So I will have an amendment and I certainly hope my colleagues will join me to restore that funding for veterans health care. I think it is critically important. 
Mr. President, let me conclude. I do not understand why we have accepted this tradeoff of tax cuts disproportionately benefiting the people on the top, not even targeting them to middle income or small businesses, and at the same time not investing in rebuilding our schools, not investing in early childhood development, not investing in making sure that every child has a head start, not investing adequately in veterans health care. 
I just think that this tradeoff is unacceptable. Yes, let us have an agreement. But what is the price? The price of this agreement is that we have, as a Senate, I think--I know some colleagues disagree with me, I know many do, I know most do--I think we have abandoned a principle that has been so important to our country. I think it has been a principle which, in many ways, has led to our resilience as a nation. 
It is a principle that has to do with the very meaning of our Nation, it is the principle of justice, it is the principle of expanding opportunities for our citizens, and it is that American dream that every child--no matter color of skin, no matter income, no matter boy or girl, no matter urban or rural, --that every child will have the same chance to reach his or her full potential. We have not met that standard in this budget agreement. We are nowhere near that standard. That is why, again, I will vote no.  
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to some of the discussion that deals with S. 4, which is egregiously entitled the `Family Friendly Workplace Act.' But I also want to say to my colleagues that I am going to spend a little bit of time talking about disaster relief and the failure of the House of Representatives to move forward with this legislation because I think that takes priority over all of our business here. 
Mr. President, I will agree with my colleagues, starting with Senator Ashcroft, whom I enjoy as a colleague, that this piece of legislation deals with a very important question. And the question is how people balance their commitments to work with their commitments to family. I think that is a very important question. 
But I would like to just repeat one more time for my colleague from Missouri and other colleagues who want to see some kind of positive, constructive legislation passed, this piece of legislation in its present form is going nowhere. And it should not go anywhere. 
Mr. President, first of all, there are two features that are automatic nonstarters. My colleague from Minnesota, whom I enjoy working with, talked about a couple of women's organizations that support this bill. My understanding is there are huge numbers of women's organizations who are in opposition, for good reason. 
First of all, we have the Fair Labor Standards Act which was hallmark legislation. The idea here was the 40-hour week. If you worked overtime you get overtime pay. That is very important. There are a whole lot of families with incomes below $20,000, $25,000 a year for whom overtime pay is key. 
What we are doing with this legislation, which has this sort of happy-face title, the `Family Friendly Workplace Act,' is we are now moving from a 40-hour week, we are abolishing it and we are going to an 80-hour 2-week period whereby an employee could work 50 or 60 hours one week, 30 or 20 hours the next week and not get paid any overtime. 
If you think that the reality is in the workplaces throughout this country that employees are equal partners in this decisionmaking in all these workplaces, then you might not worry about that. But the fact of the matter is, the vast majority of people, the vast majority of women and women's organizations, understanding the threat to the 40-hour week, will not accept this. 
This provision is not in the House bill that passed, and it should not be in this bill. It is one of the reasons this bill will go nowhere. 
Mr. President, in addition, there is another feature that deals with flextime which essentially says you can work overtime and then you can take that hour off or however many hours you worked, but you do not get an hour and a half off for an hour overtime so it becomes a cut in pay. Again, you have two features in this bill that are in direct contradiction to the Fair Labor Standards Act and, therefore, going nowhere. 
Now, the third point I want to make is that there has to be some guarantee, some way that we protect people for whom being able to work and working overtime and being paid overtime is critical to their family's income. In a huge percentage of families with incomes under $20,000 a year, the household head works overtime. So what you do not want to have happen is a situation where an employer is only going to give the overtime to those people who take comptime as opposed to people who want to have time-and-a-half pay. Again, so far, we have not seen any willingness to sit down and negotiate and compromise on some of these questions. 
Mr. President, in committee Senator Murray talked about an extension of the Family and Medical Leave Act which was terribly important. The Senator may, while she is here, raise a question with me about this, and I am pleased to do a colloquy with her on that. In addition, I had an amendment in committee which said if there is a situation dealing with Family and Medical Leave Act considerations where there is sickness in the family or whatever and you banked 20 or 40 hours, you should be able to take that time off; you do not need to ask for permission.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in responding to the question that the Senator from Washington has raised, that is really what is at issue here. There is an alternative that Senator Baucus and others have presented which really does give the employees the flexibility, if that is what this is about. We have to make sure that employees have the flexibility so that if they need to take the time off--time, I might make the point, time that they banked--if they need their comptime because they want to go to school and visit with the teacher or because they have an elderly parent that is ill, they ought to be able to do it. If we really want to give them flexibility, we should give them flexibility. That is not in this piece of legislation. 
I also say to the Senator from Washington that, in addition, we have a very serious problem here. Sometimes I think here in the Senate we lose sight of the reality of the circumstances of many families in our country. We have a paradoxical situation where we have this impressive abundance, an affluence and good macroeconomic indicators, but at the same time, we have large numbers of families that are struggling to earn a decent living and raise their 
children successfully. People are still feeling the economic squeeze, and one of the ways people are able to put food on the table and support their families is to be able to get that overtime pay for working overtime. We are not going to abandon that principle. 
This legislation in its present form will be defeated again tomorrow. People gave their sweat and their tears for fair labor standards and for a 40-hour week and for the idea that if you work overtime you get overtime pay. Now, if we want to really give employees the flexibility, we should do so. But you do not have a cut in pay with flextime, you do not have a cut in pay by abolishing the 40-hour week and going to an 80-hour 2-week framework. You make sure that employees, in fact, if they bank that extra time, that flextime, are able to take it off, time and a half for every hour worked overtime to be with their child or to be at a doctor's office with their parent. They get to do it. They do not have to ask for permission. You certainly make sure that you do not have any discrimination whereby this becomes too good a deal in its present form for too many employers, and the only people, I say to my colleague from Washington, that they give any overtime to are those people who will not ask for overtime pay, who will only ask for comptime. That is what is at issue here. 
I agree with the question, which is this is all about working families. This is all about how people balance commitment to work with balancing a commitment to family. But this piece of legislation does not give employees the flexibility, and this piece of legislation does not give people the guarantee that they will not be discriminated against and no longer able to obtain overtime pay for overtime work which is so important to so many families that are barely able to make ends meet. This piece of legislation takes the Fair Labor Standards Act and it turns it on its head. It literally overturns 50 or 60 years of people's history. It is too bad, because we could pass a piece of legislation. 
My colleague from Missouri has a good idea, at least in the goal of giving employees the flexibility. But in its present form, this piece of legislation will go nowhere. 
Mr. President, now, I understand I have not looked at some of the amendments--Senator Grassley's amendment. We also, in committee, were talking about the whole problem of bankruptcy and what happens to people who have earned this time. I think maybe the ceiling is too low and we have to have a higher threshold. Maybe something can be worked out on that, but then I hear there is another amendment that wants to apply this piece of legislation to the Congress, to staff, the people who work here. 
Well, Mr. President, I think that most of the people who work here--I have to look at all of the specifics, but I would think that a lot of people who work here might say, well, we would rather go forward and not backward. Right now, I think, people would be kind of worried about losing some of their fair labor standard protection or they would be worried about not being able to work overtime and get overtime pay. I do not think people want to see that. I also think employees here working with us want to make sure that if they bank the time, they will be able to take it off when they need to take it off to be with their families. 
So, again, Mr. President, you cannot take a piece of legislation that is flawed, I say with some regret, badly flawed for the vast majority of families in this country, and now apply it to people who work here, which just compounds the problem. Make this a good piece of legislation, and then, I say to my colleague from Iowa, and then we should apply it. I am all for that.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to mention to some of my colleagues that with some regret, at least for a while this afternoon while I have the floor, there probably will not be a lot of discussion about this important piece of legislation, because I am now at the point, as a Senator from Minnesota, where I could not have any more patience for the political process here. 
We have had people in our States, and the Chair, I know, would 
feel the same, and I believe my colleague from Missouri would feel the same way, who have been through an absolute nightmare. We have communities where everybody had to evacuate--total devastation. We have one community in Minnesota, East Grand Forks, across the Red River from Grand Forks, and everybody had to leave and the people are still waiting for the Congress to provide them with relief. And the House of Representatives had the nerve to go into recess without providing that assistance. 
Well, Mr. President, for a while this afternoon the only point of discussion while I have the floor is going to be about the problems that we are facing in States that have been flooded, in States that are waiting for this disaster relief, because I think this ought to be the priority for the Congress. Whatever I know about this political process, whatever leverage I have as a Senator, I am going to use it. I will slow up whatever I can slow up. I will stop whatever I can stop. I will do it this week, and I will do it next week and I will do it as many weeks as I need to, until that disaster relief bill is passed. I do not know what else to do. I do not know what else to do. 
Mr. President, let me just talk a little bit about what is going on here. What we have is a situation where some people are playing politics with the emergency supplemental as opposed to getting this relief out to people who are trying to rebuild their lives. 
Can you imagine, I say to the Chair and my colleague from Missouri, can you imagine how people in Idaho and Missouri would feel when their homes have been destroyed? We worked together in a bipartisan fashion, and Senator Stevens was a big part of that. We came up with not only the funding for FEMA, but most important of all is some small business loans we came up with in what is called Community Development Block Grants, moneys which would enable people to move forward with buyouts for people who live in the floodplain, enable people to have assistance to rebuild their homes. That was the good news part. We were on our way. 
And then we had a disagreement. We had a disagreement over something called the CR. Frankly, people back in the Dakotas and Minnesota do not know that much about a CR and they do not really care too much. They just thought we would have the elementary decency of providing them with some help in their hour of need. But we got a debate about the CR. 
We have another debate about roads and public parks and maybe a couple of other matters as well. I would have thought that my colleagues--and I think some Republicans agree with me, so I do not think this is really so much a partisan issue; I know that in our States, Republicans agree--I would have thought that my colleagues would have had the elementary decency, the elementary decency before they went into recess, and we were going to stop them, and I cannot even remember the technical maneuver, but we were going to try and force a vote on adjournment, I guess it was, but they did not call it adjournment. We were in recess. So, theoretically, every 2 or 3 days, we were in session, but we really were not. Then people in the House of Representatives could then vote against adjournment and feel good about it, knowing that nothing had been done. 
I could not believe it. The leadership in the House of Representatives--I do not even call it leadership when people in our States are in such need, waiting for some final assurance that relief is going to be forthcoming--goes into recess. 
They don't even have the elementary decency to put aside what differences we have and just go forward--make sure that people know that they are going to be able to rebuild their homes, make sure that people know they are going to be able to move back into their homes, and make sure that people know that they are going to be able to go on with their lives. But no. 
I am Jewish. I throw my hands around here. I am sorry, my colleagues. 
But, no. They go into recess. And I am supposed to try to explain to people in Minnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota how we can play these kind of games here? People can't believe it. 
To all of my colleagues, to all of the people who are here today, no wonder so many Americans sour on our political process. You have floods the likes of which haven't been seen for 400 or 500 years. You have total devastation. The hospitals are destroyed, schools are destroyed, and everybody in the town are all leaving. You have flooding. You have hail. You have snow. You have fire. And, in spite of all of that, the goodness of people comes out. They support each other, they love each other, and they try to get back with their lives. But they know they need help. And the House of Representatives goes into recess. It is unbelievable. 
Now we are back here, and it is Tuesday. We hear that maybe this week this disaster relief bill will not be passed. Or maybe, people say, `Well, play a game and we will put on a continuing resolution.' What does a continuing resolution have to do with the budget or have to do with getting disaster relief for people? It is called disaster relief because it is disaster. It is called an emergency supplemental bill because it is an emergency. Stop playing political games with people's lives. 
So, Mr. President, now we have a situation where some people are thinking, OK, what we will do is put a continuing resolution on this bill; it has nothing to do with emergency supplemental assistance; we will send it to the President; then he has already said he will veto it; and then it will come back here. And I don't know what they will do next. 
Why are they sending it to the President when you know he is going to veto it? If you want to debate the budget, let's debate the budget. If you want to debate the parks and the other issues, fine. But can't we just put aside our differences and please get the supplemental assistance to people? This is really a huge issue. 
Mr. President, there are families and business owners in Grand Forks, ND. My colleague from North Dakota talked about this, and East Grand Forks. They need to know whether they are going to be part of the floodplain buyout. But they do not know. They do not know whether or not there is going to be a buyout. They do not know whether they should move. They do not know whether they should try to come back to their homes. They don't know whether there is going to be any assistance at all. The State does not know whether it should go forward. The mayors do not know what they can say to the citizens because they do not know what we are going to do because people have been waiting and waiting and waiting. 
Some of my colleagues today are going to wait because I am going to talk on the floor of the Senate for a while as well because it is just simply unconscionable and it is simply indefensible that we just do not get on with the business of providing people with this assistance right now. 
Mr. President, we have another problem. If we are going to start rebuilding--I think maybe in Idaho and less in Missouri. But in Idaho I think this is a bit of an issue as well. We have to get going because our building season is over come mid to late October. 
So, if we do not get the approved funding now and we don't started with the construction we are not going to get it done. Minnesota is a cold weather State. It is without a doubt the best State in the country. But it is a cold State. We have to get the funding right now, or we are not going to get the construction work done. 
Colleagues, there are very good, very wonderful, very strong, very loving people in Minnesota and the Dakotas, and others States as well are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. They are trying somehow to rebuild their lives. They have been through a living hell. You would not wish it on anyone. They have been waiting and waiting for us to have the decency to please get the assistance to them. And we are still playing political games here. 
Mr. President, the supplemental contains $500 million in CDBG funding for flood assistance. This program is one of the oldest Federal block grant programs in existence. This gives the States the most flexibility, or it could be the most flexibility for local communities. 
Let me explain what we are talking about here. Whether we are talking about floods in the Midwest, or hurricanes in the South, or earthquakes in the West, this CDBG money is critical because it fills in the cracks. 
In other words, what happens is FEMA money is good for public infrastructure and some help for homeowners and the small business money in loans. But the problem is many people can't cash flow any more loans. They can't get their businesses going. They can't rebuild their homes unless they get this community development block grant money. We have to task--thank you, Republicans, and, thank you, Democrats. We work together. That was the right thing to do. But now--for the last 13 or 14 days, whatever it has been--people back in Minnesota cannot believe what they are seeing here. They don't understand these games. They don't understand why it is we just do not provide them with the assistance that they need. 
Mr. President, we have seen homes destroyed. We have seen city blocks immersed in water. And our communities, Ada, Warren, East Grand Forks, and others are in tremendous amount of need. They are in hurt. And they have the task of rebuilding their neighborhoods block by block and home by home. 
I would like to thank FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency for their work, and its Director James Lee Witt for his leadership. He has been great. I would like to thank all of the FEMA people who are out in Minnesota. They have been great. They are real heroes and real heroines. They are doing everything they can to help people. They are working with our community. And they are thinking about again buyouts and relocation plans. 
They are thinking about how to enable people to move back into their homes, and how people can rebuild their businesses. But we need to get the funding to our States now. We need to begin the process of rebuilding our communities. 
Mr. President, I don't know any other way to say it. I would say to my colleagues: Quit playing political football with the lives of disaster victims. Quit playing political football with the lives of disaster victims. 
I don't know anything else to do. I mean, I apologize to my colleagues. I am going to continue to talk for a while--not all day and all night and all day tomorrow. But I do want to speak for a while about this. 
Really, every opportunity I get as a Senator I am going to continue to come out and hold the floor. And I think just about every other Senator will do the same thing from our States. This is going to go on. Any Senator would do it, Democrat, or Republican. What else are you supposed to do? 
I mean the first thing you do is you try to appeal to the common sense of some of your colleagues. You say, look, we have some differences here. So why don't we just put those differences aside and just get the assistance to people because we don't differ on that. 
This is an emergency. Let's get the emergency assistance to people now. We tried to make that appeal. That didn't work. Then you try and appeal to the goodness of people. You say, look, people are hurting. People need some certainty. People need to have some confidence that we are going to provide some assistance 
to people. Please, Representatives; please Senators--I think even more Representatives now that I think about it on the House side--please. Can't you just put aside the differences? Can't we just go forward with what we agree on and get this disaster relief to people? 
That doesn't work. 
Then you try another appeal. You say, look, Senator, if it was your State, you would want to get that assistance out to the people. You would have a tough time going home and looking at people in the eye and having them look at you and try to explain what in the world is going on here. 
So you try to appeal to colleagues, and you say, `Look, I have always been there for you when you needed help in Missouri, or you needed help in Idaho, or whatever State, which is true. I remember the flooding and what they went through just a few years ago. Now we need help. Please, won't you help us get this through? 
And that doesn't work. 
So, since none of that works, there is only one thing to do. And that is just use the Senate rules and figure out your leverage and just do not let the U.S. Congress--in particular the House of Representatives which has this held up--go on with business as usual. We are going to talk about what is going on in Minnesota, the Dakotas, Missouri, and California, and a variety of other States. 
Mr. President, I have here a letter from the mayor of East Grand Forks, MN, Lynn Stauss. 
I tell you. My colleague, Representative Collin Peterson, made a very good point this morning. Lynn Stauss is a part-time mayor. He makes about $5,300 a year. He is coming back out here tomorrow, and the mayor of Grand Forks, ND, as well. They shouldn't have to keep coming out here. But they have to keep coming out here to keep saying to people: `Please, Senators and Representatives, don't make the people in our communities an abstraction.' We are talking about real men, real women, and their children. 
I don't know how the mayor has done it. He has been incredibly courageous. He has given people a lot of hope under some very difficult conditions, I say to a former mayor, Mr. President. But I know it gets hard after a while. People start to run out of hope when we don't come through here in the Congress. 
So this is a letter dated May 20, 1997. I should have brought my glasses knowing that I was going to be on the floor for a while. 
Do you have any glasses? [Laughter.] 
These glasses are too conservative. I thank my colleague from Missouri. I have never understood how such a good person could have such bad ideas. [Laughter.]  
Dear Senator Dorgan: We understand that there are currently proposals to dispose of the five hundred million in CDBG grants for disaster aid in two separate payments. Because of the magnitude of destruction of the record setting flood of 1997 and the ice storm preceding the flood on April 4, 1997 throughout the Red River Valley, especially to the communities of Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, it is imperative that the total amount of five hundred million be released to our communities without delay. The people of our communities have suffered the loss of income, homes and businesses. In addition, our streets, water system, electrical system and sanitation system have been severely damaged and require immediate attention. The public facilities as we once knew them are virtually non-existent. We are now a community without a city hall, a library, several schools, fire hall and senior citizens center. 
Our number one priority is the acquisition of over 600 homes and businesses from the floodway. Immediate acquisition and relocation is the only preventive measure in relieving stress and allowing our citizens an opportunity to rebuild in our communities. Because of our short window of construction, if we do not act now our businesses and residents will have no alternative but to relocate in other communities. 
We enclose for your information a copy of a proposal from Wynne Consultants which clearly depicts the aftermath and total devastation left by the flood and ice storm. We believe the report will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of our urgent, basic needs. The five hundred million in CDBG grants must be released to our communities to allow us the flexibility to rebuild and move forward with our lives. 
Mr. President, this is from the mayor, and I just want to emphasize the importance of the words `to rebuild and move forward with our lives.' Again, Mr. President, I am sorry to inconvenience colleagues, but I feel as if people in Minnesota have been inconvenienced, and I think it is important to focus on this because I think we should pass this before we do anything else. 
An emergency supplemental is an emergency supplemental. That does not mean messing around, playing all sorts of political games. And disaster relief is disaster relief. It seems to me to be patently unfair and insensitive and unconscionable for the House of Representatives to go into recess and not pass this disaster relief bill or for this week all of us in the Congress to mess around and mess around and mess around and not do this work. If there is one thing we should do this week, it should be to pass this disaster relief bill. This should come before anything else. This disaster relief bill should come before, I say to my colleague--I know how much work he has put into this, and I still think there is a possibility of passing a good piece of legislation when we get down to really give-and-take discussion and work together. I do not think this bill will pass in its present form. I do not think it should.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not think this piece of legislation takes first priority. I do not think some of the amendments that are on the floor right now take first priority. I am not speaking about those amendments. There is not anybody who is going to speak on those amendments for a while. I do not think those amendments should take priority. I do not think the budget, if we get to the budget sometime this week, should take priority. I do not think there is anything we could do this week that would be as important as providing people, families, who have been through just total devastation with a helping hand. Can't we do that? Can't we just provide people a helping hand? Can't we give people some confidence they are going to have some assistance so they can move back into their homes? Is that too much to ask? Can't we give some small businesses some confidence that there is going to be some access to capital and some assistance so they can start up their businesses again? 
I want to tell you something. Maybe some people think some of this is funny, but I want to tell you something. A whole lot of these people, these homeowners and these business people, are leaving. They are not going to be able to stay in these communities, I say to the majority leader, who has helped us, who has done a good job, and I thank him. These people are not going to be able to move back into their communities. A lot of these people are going to leave. That is what we are now here on. 
So, Mr. President, I think it is appropriate that I take the floor and speak about this because I am hearing this from people in my State. And I know other Senators are hearing this as well. 
Mr. President, this is a letter from the mayor of East Grant Forks, Lynn Stauss, again, who has just done a yeoman job, to members of the task force, the Minnesota Recovery Task Force: 
Please accept the following information as our preliminary application to the Minnesota Recovery Disaster Task Force. We hope the data we have included will assist you in assessing the level of damage in East Grand Forks and allow us to receive early consideration in the coming discussion on recovery activity in our State. We consider our position to be worthy of a serious share of the Federal and State funding that will come to Minnesota. I know that you have been apprised of our damage situation throughout the Nation and statewide media over the hours of this disaster. Our city staff would welcome the opportunity to answer your questions at any time. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
Lynn Stauss, Mayor, East Grand Forks. 
Now, Mr. President, what I have here--and it will take me a little bit of time to read this application--is the application from the mayor. I want to emphasize one more time--and, Mr. 
President, I would like to apologize to some citizens who have come here today who are here during our proceeding. Normally we have debate on amendments, and when I start reading from some of this I fear that for some people here that will not be--without knowing the ins and outs of all of this, it may not be relevant, but I want to just make it clear one more time I once in a while come to the floor of the Senate and do this, but not very often, and I think those of us, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, don't come to the floor of the Senate and do this and hold the floor unless we really feel strongly about something. 
But, Mr. President, I do feel strongly about this. Time is not neutral. Time rushes on. There are too many people who are hurting. They have asked for assistance, and we have got people who are playing games here. There is no other order of business that should come before our passing this emergency supplemental bill that provides disaster relief to people who have been through hell. They deserve our help, and they should not have to wait. They should not have to be out there twisting in the wind. They should not have to wonder what in the world is the matter with us. This bill ought to pass this week. This bill ought to pass today. I would be proud or pleased to leave the floor right now if I only thought something was going to be done. 
Mr. President, let me go on and read from this application. This is just from East Grand Forks, really not talking about--I was in Ada, MN. In Ada, MN, it was just devastating. The school was completely flooded, much of it destroyed. They are going to be able to renovate the school, but can you imagine this? Here you have the school completely destroyed. It is going to be rebuilt, but somehow those students and the teachers and the support staff and the superintendent and the parents and the neighbors all banded together, and other schools will take in those kids and those kids are now finishing school and they are going to graduate. That is inspiring. 
I will tell you something, Mr. President. What is not inspiring is this Congress. What is not inspiring is the House of Representatives. What is not inspiring is the Representatives or Senators who put extraneous measures onto this piece of legislation and are not willing to get the assistance to people who need it now. That is not inspiring. We do not set a very good model for young people when we cannot stop playing games and just provide assistance to people who need that assistance. 
In Ada, as well, their hospital was just, again, devastated. They had to, in the dark of night, I think it was late at night, 10, 11, 12 o'clock, they had to take elderly people out of the nursing home, had to evacuate them. It was just unbelievable what people went through. Can you imagine a hospital destroyed, the community center destroyed, the school destroyed? And can you imagine what it would be like to, first of all, be flooded out and then you are faced with a blizzard and people do not have any heat? People go through all of this and they continue to flourish, and the churches or the synagogues all come together and people help one another and somehow people make it through, although there is a lot of hurt and there is a lot of pain and probably some people are going to have to go through a fair amount of counseling to get through all this. But at the very minimum couldn't this Congress--I say this now to the majority party--pass this emergency supplemental bill now? 
Doesn't emergency mean emergency? Could not we provide this assistance to people now? Is that too much to ask? Is that too much for the people of Grand Forks, ND, to ask? Is that too much for the people of East Grand Forks to ask? Is that too much for the people of Warren, MN, to ask? Is that too much for the people of Ada, MN, to ask? 
I heard my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, this morning. I thought he was eloquent. He said something like how many more days do people have to wait? I think that is an important question. How many more days, how many more weeks do people have to wait for help? How many more days do the people in 
our communities who are trying to rebuild their schools or hospitals have to wait? How many more days do the people who are trying to find out whether they are going to be moving or whether they are going to be staying or whether they are going to have money to rebuild their homes or to rebuild their businesses, how much longer do they have to wait? How much longer do senior citizens, many elderly people--a very high percentage of our smaller towns and communities really are comprised of elderly citizens. How much longer do they have to wait to know whether they are going to be able to live there? 
The answer will be determined by what we do or what we do not do. I am determined as a Senator from Minnesota to do everything I can to make as many of my colleagues as uncomfortable as possible until we take action. 
Let me repeat that. Whatever I can do to make those who are responsible for this delay uncomfortable, whatever I can do to focus attention on their irresponsibility, to focus attention on their insensitivity, to focus attention on their callousness, whatever I can do to make it clear to the leadership of the House of Representatives it is time to get serious, it is time, as my children would have said when they were younger, to get real I will do. 
Mr. President, this application form--let me read from this form:  
The flooding of April 1997 caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to private properties, infrastructure and businesses in the city of East Grand Forks. 
Mr. President, I think what I am going to do is actually read this slowly because right now time will move on slowly on the floor of the Senate: 
Damage to housing ranged from complete destruction of the properties to severely damaged basements, electrical systems, and heating systems. 
By the way, built into this disaster relief bill--and I thank my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats--is some assistance in the low-income home energy assistance program, the LIHEAP program--Senator Stevens helped us on that--which will enable people, for example, to buy new furnaces, which will be a big help. Again, it will not happen, it will not happen until this disaster relief bill is passed: 
The vast majority of single family and multifamily dwelling units sustained damage. Similar damages to privately owned commercial properties occurred. Beyond the costs of the physical damage, these businesses have also been forced to deal with the economic loss associated with being unable to operate. Many have been unable to reopen and those that have to deal with having lost employees. 
That is another issue, Mr. President. I know that when I went to Breckenridge, it was just really poignant because there I met with all of these small business people. It was not a meeting that had been arranged. I just came up to look at the flooding. And as soon as I came into the community, all of these small business people came up to me--and I am not putting them down at all, you understand--and they were absolutely desperate. I mean, there was just desperation and fear; they were really so frightened. And they were saying, look, we can't make this unless we get some assistance. And, Senator Wellstone, if you just give us loans, we can't cash flow those loans and we are not only worried about ourselves, we also are worried about our employees. 
Well, you know what? All the time I hear speeches given about small businesses, `Oh, we love small businesses. They are just like family farmers.' We love them in the abstract. 
You know what? We have a lot of small businesses in Minnesota and the Dakotas that have been flooded out. We have a lot of small businesses that want to rebuild their businesses. We have a lot of towns that depend on those small businesses. 
I hear my colleagues always say they are for the small businesses. You know what? The best way you can be for small businesses this week is to do something concrete, which is to stop playing games with this disaster relief bill, pass this piece of legislation, and get the assistance to people so they can start their businesses up again, so they can at least begin the process of rebuilding. 
The mayor goes on to say: 
The magnitude of the loss has forced the city to move forward on the implementation of measures to minimize the future possibility of a similar event occurring. At a time when the city is forced to deal with the enormous expense of reconstruction, it is also faced with considering the huge expense of future mitigation. 
This is going to be a much bigger part of what we do in the future, which is mitigation, which is to try to figure out how to prevent this from happening in the first place. So people who are living in a 100-year floodplain are not necessarily going to live there. We are going to relocate some people. We are going to relocate some businesses. We are going to do that in lots of parts of this country. That is going to be a bigger part of what FEMA and other agencies do as well. 
The city is currently in the process of planning the construction of a dike-levee system which will ultimately result in the need to relocate households residing on the `west side' of the dikes. At this time, the final dike alignment has not been established. However, it is evident that at least 300 households will have to be initially relocated and ultimately 650 to 700 households need to be relocated. Businesses located in the immediate downtown also will need to relocate, probably 10 to 15 commercial properties. 
Mr. President, I have here somewhere a document where Kit Hadley, who heads up the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, said the other day that this was one of the worst housing disasters in the history of our country. It is true. I mean, when whole towns evacuate, when people become refugees, when so many people are still homeless, people who worked hard all their lives, that is a housing disaster. It is a housing disaster, I say to my colleagues in the House and I say to my colleagues in the Senate, but especially in the House. It is time to get on with the work. It is time to provide some relief to people. It is time to provide people with some assistance. 
Businesses located in the immediate downtown also will need to relocate, probably 10 to 15 commercial properties. Planning is underway to establish sites to which the business, primarily commercial and residential, relocations will occur. Several potential sites for residential relocation are currently being considered. Although no final decision has been made on the business relocations, the B-N triangle, a parcel situated immediately to the east of the current downtown district, is being considered. At each site to which the relocations will ultimately occur the establishment of essential infrastructure will be necessary--sewer, sanitary and storm water, and streets. Damage to infrastructure was citywide and included all of the major infrastructural systems. 
Can you imagine this? Damage to the sanitary sewer, to the storm sewer, to the water system and the streets--all of that damage took place. 
Other public facilities, such as public buildings, were also damaged, several beyond repair, including the city hall and the fire department. Damages to park and recreation facilities and buildings were severe and widespread. Among the public structures which were destroyed were three schools. 
Mr. President, this reminds me of a poignant moment. My colleague from the 7th Congressional District, Congressman Peterson, Collin Peterson, spoke at graduation--I heard about this--to the students of East Grand Forks who had been flooded out, whose school had been destroyed. He said to the students, `You know, as much agony as you and your families have gone through, you have probably learned more than you could have ever learned in school'--and I think that is true--`about yourselves and, really, about your community.' 
I would add to Congressman Peterson that I think people in our communities have learned about all of the heroes and heroines that there are. Someday--as long as I am on the floor here for a while--I am going to write a book. Maybe I can get my colleague from Missouri to coauthor it. Because this would cut across all parties and all ideology, and he is like this in terms of what he believes in. What it would be, there was a book written years ago that should be immortal, by James Agee, Walter Evans was the photographer, and the name of the book was, `Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.' It's a long story. Forbes magazine had commissioned James Agee back in the 1940's to go, I think, back to Alabama to write about the pathology of poor sharecroppers and tenant farmers. And he went there and lived with people. Mr. President, he, as opposed to his impression before he was there, and his thesis, he thought to himself, `It's amazing that under these conditions, people are able to survive or even flourish. They should be famous.' So he wrote a very different kind of book with wonderful, powerful photographs. 
We could do a book. The Chair is like this as well. Three of us could write this book, and we could title it, `Let Us Now Praise Famous Men or Women.' It wouldn't matter whether they were Democrats or Republicans. What it would be, it would be about men and women in communities who do wonderful things in their community. You know what I mean? I mean, it wouldn't be cynical; it would be uplifting. It would be about all the people in our country who do really wonderful work in their communities. No one knows them. They are not nationally famous or internationally famous. They don't do it for that. But they should be famous. 
Mr. President, only because I don't want to yield the floor, I would ask my colleague whether he would consider doing it with me, but then I would lose my floor privilege. But I am telling you, this would be a good book. There would be more Democrats profiled in the book than Republicans. But, you know, it would be more or less balanced. More or less. 
To be more serious, it wouldn't have anything to do with parties. But there are a lot of great people in this country. And there are a lot of people who are unsung heroes and heroines. There were a lot of people in East Grand Forks and Granite Falls and Montevideo and Warren and Ada and Grand Forks who are heroes and heroines. Boy, I don't know how--I say to a former mayor--I don't know how the mayors have been able to do this. But we have had Mayor Owens and Mayor Stauss. They have been just unbelievable. Pat Owens has been--people have seen her. She didn't want it. I know that it would have been her prayer to have never had this opportunity to be such a national spokesperson, because she would never have wanted for this to happen in her community. But she has so inspired people, she has, over and over again, called on people not to give up and called on people to have hope, and has said we can rebuild our communities. 
And now the big missing ingredient is our support, our assistance. We pass disaster relief bills when there are disasters. And this is a disaster. We pass emergency supplemental pieces of legislation when there is an emergency. I really think that we are doing one heck of a job in this Congress of souring people toward our political process by our failure to live up to just the sort of basic standard of decency. 
Look, I don't like to say this. I should not say it because, 
I don't know, maybe I am giving ground here. But, you know, if some of my colleagues, some of my colleagues on the other side, if they want to have a continuing resolution and they are going to put it on this disaster relief bill because it gives them leverage--you do have leverage. You do have leverage. When people are desperate, it gives you leverage. If that is what they want to do and send it to the President, playing the game, knowing he is going to veto it, do it. Do it today. Get it done. Send it to the President, he vetoes it, it comes back here, then take it off. Everybody can claim victory. Whatever you want to do. Just get it done and just get this disaster relief bill passed. 
This assistance from the Congress is not going to make people whole. It is not going to be enough. The only thing this does, it gets people at least a chance, at least a chance. Can we at least do that? 
Mr. President, this is one of many articles I see here. Maybe there will be an opportunity while I am on the floor. I know there were also--I am looking for the author of this. It was in the Star Tribune. I also know the Pioneer Press--I read of the work of Nick Coleman in the Pioneer Press, which was very, very powerful. I may want to read from that, either this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow. I will not be on the floor all day and night. But I will be on the floor a lot over the next couple of days, over the next couple of weeks--who knows, over the next couple of months. I would think we will get this done. 
But, you know what, my expectations are pretty low. I could not believe it, Mr. President. We had a press conference last week. I guess it was right before we went into recess. I said at this press conference--I guess it was Thursday, because we went into recess that Friday. I said that the House not sending us back something to work with, it was probably the worst--it was, for me--the lowest or most disappointing or worst time I had in the Senate. Because I thought that in the end, the goodness of people would come through. And even though people disagreed on the continuing resolution and whatnot, people would at least agree to agree on what we agreed on and get the disaster relief to people who were in such need. 
There was someone at this press conference, a journalist. There was some laughter. I said, `Wait a minute. You know, I don't think I am being naive. I don't think this is naive at all to believe in the goodness of people, including my colleagues.' 
I love being a Senator. I get goose bumps when I have a chance to be on the floor of the Senate. I do. I never thought I would have a chance to be here. It is a huge honor, and every day you hope you will do your job well. You make plenty of mistakes, but you do your very best. It's a huge honor. 
I was a teacher for 20 years. I want young people to be interested in public service. I like the people I work with. I enjoy people here in the Senate and I enjoy people in the House, agree or disagree. 
But there comes a certain point in time where, you know, the indignation just kind of takes over. And I have just run out of patience. 
This is outrageous. This is outrageous. Frankly, I would say to people in the House of Representatives, who went into recess without sending that disaster relief bill over here and getting the job done, shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. It is not too much to expect for you to get some help, some assistance to people in our States who are in such pain and really need the help now. 
They really do. Time is not neutral for them. Time rushes on. I mean, if they do not get the help, people are going to leave or families are going to just be under such pressure and without any hope, who knows what happens? But I will tell you one thing--I will tell you one thing, Mr. President--I do not want to go back to East Grand Forks and some of the other communities and look at people and try to explain to them why in the world this Congress did not take any action. I just cannot explain it. And the one thing I do know is, even if I inconvenience some of my colleagues, the one thing I do know is there isn't going to be anybody in Minnesota that is going to be able to say I did not fight for this, win or lose. 
So I get to speak on the floor of the Senate now. And I will continue to speak on the floor of the Senate for a while. And then I just want to put my colleagues on notice: Everything you bring on the floor of the Senate, everything you bring this week and next week, I will look for leverage, I will somehow get to the floor, and I will do everything I can to put the focus back on getting emergency assistance to people in Minnesota and the Dakotas and our other States as well. 
You know, we have some distorted priorities here when people want to play games with the lives of people who are in such pain, in such agony. 
This is an article from the Star Tribune, Minnesota Star Tribune. It is called `Stains of Pain.' Mr. President, the top of it reads, `The people at ground zero of the Red River flood want desperately to get on with their lives. But how do they do that when they are adrift in such wreckage?'  
The people at ground zero of the Red River flood want desperately to get on with their lives. But how do they do that when they are adrift in such wreckage? 
Grand Forks, N.D: On Belmont Road, a fading sign propped against a sagging mound of clothes, furniture and appliances proclaims, `We are not what we own.' 
At the Darbyshire house on Polk Street, a battered house knocked off its foundation, a pink `condemned' notice is taped on the front door. Look down from the notice and you look into what was the Darbyshires' basement. 
In north Grand Forks, in the Riverside neighborhood, a bright yellow house is stained dull brown to the eaves. The Riverside Park swimming pool is a sewage lagoon. 
Across the Red River, on the northwestern edge of East Grand Forks, a girl plays by the street, listless and unsmiling. She tosses a scrap of something into the air, watches it fall, then tosses it again. 
I am going to read that again. `Across the Red River, on the northwestern edge of East Grand Forks, a girl plays by the street, listless and unsmiling.' 
Mr. President, you are talking about a little girl listless and unsmiling. I guess so, given what she and her family have been through. 
Maybe what we need to do is we need to understand that these words or these articles, this is not just a distraction, this is not just statistics, we are talking about people's lives. 
This little girl, Mr. President, listless and unsmiling, should not have to stay listless and unsmiling. Little children should be smiling. Little children should be happy. Little children should be looking for their future. We ought to give this 
little girl and her family, Mr. President, some reason to expect that will happen. And yet we cannot provide disaster relief for people who have been flooded out of their homes? We cannot provide support for little children? Sounds kind of melodramatic, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I do not want to lose my floor privilege. 
Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Kansas be able to give a tribute to Senator Strom Thurmond, after which I then would retain my right to the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, before entertaining a question from my colleague, a request from my colleague, let me read from an article. And I see my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is on the floor. Let me read from an article, `Stains of Pain,' dealing with Grand Forks, ND. This was May 25, 1997. 
It has been five weeks since the river swamped these towns. The river is back in its banks now, officially below flood stage, far from homes and businesses and children at play. 
But the water marks remain everywhere. 
Mr. President, I was just thinking, I know some of my colleagues want to speak, but I also see my colleague here from North Dakota. I wonder whether it would be possible, Mr. President, I want to read this article, and then if there are some requests about speaking, perhaps we could do that, although I then want to make it clear that on unanimous consent, my resumption on the floor not be counted as a second speech. 
Now, I want to make it clear to my colleagues if they put in that request, that would be part of my unanimous-consent agreement. I also make a request, I know my colleagues want to speak about some other things, but, for certain, if colleagues want to speak about Senator Strom Thurmond, I do not want to interrupt that in any way, shape or form. If colleagues want to speak about Senator Thurmond, fine. 
Otherwise, I know there are things a few people want to cover. What we are doing here today is saying we want to focus on this and this will be it. This is the issue. This is the action that should be taken.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from North Dakota, that would be fine. I would like to finish reading this article and then accommodate colleagues, but I also ask unanimous consent I maintain my floor privilege. If I could finish this, let me go on with this article. 
On Polk Street, a block off Lincoln Drive, Paul Dilling stands in the front yard of his ruined house, which was submerged to the rafters. He stands by his water mark: A U.S. flag, muddy and torn, which he salvaged from the muck and stuck on a stick. 
But it has been five weeks of misery for Dilling. 
That is really the point I am trying to make. It has been 5 weeks of misery. People have been through misery. They have been devastated, and now they wait for this Congress to pass the disaster relief bill. That is why I am saying this should be the first item of business for us. 
It is interesting, there is a St. Paul Pioneer Press editorial of May 23, with a headline `Congress Can't Resist Political Gamesmanship.' 
Congress has breezed out of town, leaving Washington for a long holiday recess. Despite evidence to the contrary, congressional bigwigs figured satisfying their political egos was more important than expediting flood relief legislation that would aid, among other backwaters, Minnesota and the Dakotas. 
I know that my colleagues may want to have some floor time now, so I will be very brief. But let me just for a moment develop this point, and then I will keep my floor privileges. This is from the St. Paul Pioneer Press. 
Now, I have not always agreed with the editorial positions of the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Sometimes I have, sometimes I have 
not. That is beside the point. Sometimes the St. Paul Pioneer Press will take editorial positions closer to the positions of the distinguished Chair or my colleague from Missouri. It is an interesting paper, and they, like any good editorial page, have their own integrity and they say what they think is right. But I just want to make it clear that this is not some sort of editorial written by Democrats trying to figure out a way to criticize Republicans. 
Congress Can't Resist Political Gamesmanship 
Congress has breezed out of town, leaving Washington for a long holiday recess [right before Memorial Day recess]. Despite evidence to the contrary, congressional bigwigs figured satisfying their political egos was more important than expediting flood relief legislation that would aid, among other backwaters, Minnesota and the Dakotas. 
We have had enough of this political gamesmanship. We have had enough of it. We have people in our States that are hurting. We have children that are homeless. We have children that have had to live through this devastation. We have families under duress. We have families under pressure. And the people in Minnesota and the people in the Dakotas and the people in some of the other States have every right to believe that the goodness of the Congress would come through and we would provide them with the assistance they so badly need to rebuild their lives. 
You have people in the House of Representatives that go on vacation as opposed to providing this assistance. That is why I am on the floor today. That is why I am staying on the floor. And now I hear that this week we may not pass this. This is outrageous. 
One more time: If you want to have a debate about a continuing resolution budget, debate it. If you want to have a debate about parks and environmental legislation, debate it. But do not put it on a disaster relief bill. Do not hold good people that deserve our support hostage to your grand political strategy. 
Today, it is an inconvenience. We have a bill on the floor. It is a slight inconvenience. People wanted to have a discussion on amendments, and we are not doing that today. It is not a major inconvenience. But you know what? I actually think, and I do not mean this in an arrogant way, I think I am doing some of the leadership in the House of Representatives a favor, because if, in my own small way, I can put any pressure on them to do the right thing, they will be better off, because they look terrible. They look terrible. You could do a poll in Missouri, Massachusetts, Minnesota, anywhere in the country, and 99.9 percent of the people in the country would say this is outrageous. Can't you people at least provide help to people when they need it? That is what this is all about. 
I say to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, I am actually being a pretty good politician. I say first to the Star Tribune, both newspapers, this is a very good article, and there are many others. This editorial of the St. Paul Pioneer Press is right on the mark. 
Now, this hurts. `Despite evidence to the contrary, congressional bigwigs * * *'--I hate to hear that. But you know something, it is too easy to do. Mr. President, I do not like it when my colleagues are called congressional bigwigs. 
I tell you something, you are bringing it on yourselves. I actually do not know if I should use the word `leadership' in the House, because I think it is hard to say there is any leadership when you cannot move forward on a disaster relief bill. 
But I tell you something, here is a headline in the Star Tribune, `Flood Relief'--and I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, I will finish up in a moment--`Flood relief, a political football, takes another bounce in D.C.'  
Congressional skirmishing delayed consideration of flood relief legislation Thursday, and the $5.5 billion aid package will not be approved until Congress returns from the Memorial Day recess early next month. 
That is from Washington bureau chief Tom Hamburger, Star Tribune. 
Well, Mr. President, I have plenty of articles to read from. I have applications from some of our cities that have been devastated. I will have time to continue to talk about what has happened, but I will tell you that if my being on the floor of the Senate at least for a while, at least for the rest of the afternoon, and then, as I say, all week and the weeks to come, every time I can come out here, any leverage I have to come out here and talk about this, I will keep pressing and pressing and pressing and pressing and pressing. 
My colleagues are going to hear about people in East Grand Forks and Ada and so many towns, they will get tired of hearing about it. But you know what? I do not really care, because this is just outrageous. 
I have some very good people I work with that are on the floor now, representing a broad spectrum of political opinion, Senator Kennedy and Senator Ashcroft, but I tell you something, this is not a great moment for the Congress, and I think it is outrageous what the House of Representatives did. This disaster relief bill has to get passed, and it has to get passed this week. The only way I know to try and do everything I can, there is no guarantee, is just to raise a lot of heck--I did say heck--on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I will continue to do so. 
Now, I have other points I want to make, but I see the Senator from Massachusetts. I wonder if the Senator may have an inquiry he would like to make. I still have the floor, Mr. President, and I want to make it clear that if I do take any question from the Senator or give the Senator any time, I ask unanimous consent if the Senator wants to speak, either Senator, I ask unanimous consent my resumption on the floor not be counted as a second speech.

But, Mr. President, I have been willing to ask unanimous consent that Senators who want to speak--at least, the Senator from Massachusetts wanted to cover something else as well--but at least speak about Strom Thurmond be able to do so, who has served for so many decades in the Senate, and as long as my resumption on the floor not be counted as a second speech. 
It is a reasonable unanimous consent. My colleague from my Missouri has not agreed to do that. I just want Senators to understand what is going on here. 
I am pleased to go on and speak. I just think it is a shame that Senators who want to speak at least about Senator Thurmond are not able to do so. 
Mr. President, I will go on. I believe my colleague has a question.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be pleased to talk about S. 4, and will do so. 
Mr. President, we have here what is called the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Mr. President, in all due respect, it is hardly friendly to families. 
Mr. President, as I have mentioned earlier, we have to approach legislation sometime in the sense of history. There was once an exchange I had on the floor of the Senate with my colleague from Missouri where we talked about a song, `Which Side Are You On?' Florence Reese actually wrote it. Florence Reese was a great troubadour for working people and for unions, especially mine workers. 
Mr. President, when we were able to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act in the 1930's, that was an enormous step forward for working people. 
This piece of legislation, Mr. President, essentially wipes out almost 60 years of people's history. 
Mr. President, for those who are watching this debate, since we are going to talk about this bill for a while before we again talk about disaster relief by the rules that I am now under, for those people that are watching this debate, one of the things that was most important about the Fair Labor Standards Act was the idea of the 40-hour week. The idea was that if you worked overtime you would get overtime pay. 
Mr. President, I am speaking without notes. So I don't remember the exact figures. But I believe somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 percent of those households with incomes under $20,000 a year depend on overtime pay. 
So, Mr. President, one of the things which is a dear principle here is that there is no way as a Senator from Minnesota, which is a State that believes in economic justice, that I am going to let any piece of legislation, or at least to the best of my ability I am going to try to prevent it from overturning the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
So, Mr. President, if you work overtime, you ought to get overtime pay. That is a cherished principle. This piece of legislation wipes that out. And it is called the Family Friendly Workplace Act? 
Well, Mr. President, let me just make it clear that if you have a situation where you now have a piece of legislation that says that if people work 50 hours or 60 hours or even theoretically 70 hours a week, yes, they might only work 20 hours the next week under this legislation, or 30 hours, or whatever but they don't get any time and a half off. So it becomes a pay cut. 
That is what it is all about. This isn't the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This is the Paycheck Cut Act.

Mr. WELLSTONE. So this piece of legislation, Mr. President, which is supposed to be friendly to families establishes a new framework. It is not the 40-hour week. 
Second of all, you have a flextime provision which says that you work overtime and then you can take some time off but it is hour for hour. You don't get time and a half off. 
Mr. President, that hardly represents a family friendly workplace. 
Mr. President, I regret what I just said to my colleague. He asked me to yield for a question. I certainly will. I got caught up a little bit in sort of the, you know, kind of anger from a couple of minutes ago. I am not being at all gracious. 
Mr. President, I will continue to speak, but if my colleague has a question, I think he did, I will be pleased to respond.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond to my colleague's question. 
Let me first of all just say that I have spent enough time as a community organizer, and I have spent enough time with working people, many of whom are nonunion workplaces. One big difference, of course, is that with Federal employees and public employees that a much larger percentage of the work force are unionized and that I know that what in theory can look voluntary and look like a partnership isn't always the case. 
Whereas, in theory it would look like an employer couldn't say to an employee, `Look. You know, here is my proposition. I want you to work 50 hours this week, and, yes, that is 10 hours overtime, but you get 30 hours off next week. That is what I want you to do.' In theory, the employee doesn't have to do it. But anybody who knows anything about the reality of many people in terms of what they deal with at the workplace knows that they don't exactly have a lot of power, and they are not exactly in a position to say no, especially when that job might be the only job there and they have to put food on the table for their kids. 
People put up with a lot. 
Mr. President, lest anyone think that I am some sort of devoted to class warfare, let me just examine the facts. 
Last year the Department of Labor found violations of current overtime law in 13,687 cases involving 170,000 workers. They awarded over $100 million in back pay. The Department's Wage and Hour Division has a current backlog of approximately 40 percent of annual complaints. 
In the garment industry, an investigatory survey conducted by the Department in Los Angeles last year revealed noncompliance with current overtime law in 55 percent of our shops. 
In our subcommittee we watched the videotape feature from CBS news which chronicled a `Battle Against Overtime,' apparently 
conducted systematically by one of the country's largest supermarket chains. The news item reported on the company's alleged practice of coercing employees to perform work off the clock; that is, without any pay in order to avoid paying overtime. 
Mr. President, these practices may not be the norm for most employers but they do demonstrate the need to protect against a bill which will provide employers with a tool which they could use to avoid paying overtime. 
So I have no doubt that my colleague means exactly what he says. There isn't anybody that believes anything other than that about it. He means what he says. But, what looks good in theory doesn't work in practice. That is the problem. 
That is why, Mr. President, in the House of Representatives in the piece of legislation that they passed the only thing you have is the comptime. With comptime you get an hour and a half off for the hour that you worked overtime, or you get an hour and a half in pay. 
That is why this piece of legislation has been called, even by some of the people in the House that supported that bill, too extreme. And it is. Because, Mr. President, what you are going to have here when you do away with a 40-hour week and you get into this 80-hour-week framework is all sorts of potential for abuses of power. 
Mr. President, if we didn't have the record that I just read to you about some of the existing abuses, and the way in which there is forced overtime right now, I wouldn't worry about it. But, Mr. President, that is the reality. That is the reality. That is one of the problems.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-28-19970603</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, he raises a couple of important questions and good questions. The fact that the law does not work so well now does not mean that we now make the existing law even weaker with the hope that somehow it will work better. 
That is my first point. My second point, Mr. President, is that we have a backlog. We have a significant backlog of cases, and my understanding is that another problem with the bill is that not only does the bill not exclude certain categories of workers, like people in the garment industry that should be excluded given the existing record, but you don't have the existing woman- and man-power enforcement. We are going to need more of that. 
Third, I say to my colleague, I think what he is talking about would be helpful especially if we wanted to pass a piece of legislation and one of the areas where we would really have to toughen this up is we have to make sure that there is not any discrimination here. 
I talked about this earlier. What I was talking about earlier is what many people as they now come to find out--at first I think people really liked the bill when they first heard about it. They liked the bill because my colleague is on to something important and he is trying to do something I think important. And that is, people were saying look, you know, if there is a way that we could have more flexibility and could be able to spend more time at home and we could have the flexibility to get the comptime and time-and-a-half off instead of time-and-a-half wages, we would like to have that option. 
But what people are deathly afraid of, and for good reason, is what's going to happen is that in the absence of some sort of protection here against discrimination, there is going to be no guarantee that all too many employers are going to basically say, well, Senator Ashcroft and Brian Ahlberg and Paul Wellstone, there are three of you. Now, Brian Ahlberg and Senator Ashcroft, you two folks, you want overtime work and you are willing to take time-and-a-half off but not time-and-a-half pay. We will give you the overtime work because, as an employer, as a company, I don't want to give you the time-and-a-half pay. 
That is a huge problem. If we do not have some sort of a way in which we can guarantee that you will not have that discrimination, then a whole lot of families that are struggling to make ends meet may not be able to get that overtime pay that they depend upon. 
So, Mr. President, let me just make it crystal clear that the bill's penalties right now for coercion do not cover the discrimination that we are worried about. And I would just make it clear that one of the things we might want to do is accept the Kennedy amendment which was turned down in committee that deals with discrimination. 
The bill's penalties now apply to this kind of discrimination, and we are making progress. But, Mr. President, I am puzzled--I see my colleague on his feet, and I am pleased to take another question if he has one, but let me just say to my colleague that I am puzzled by the current approach we are taking. 
It doesn't trouble me because I am able to speak about what I think should be the priority of this Congress, which is getting disaster relief to people in communities in Minnesota and the 
Dakotas, and I will be back on that at 5:20 or whenever I can, but I would say to my colleague, I am puzzled with the approach taken here because this bill is not going to pass, and yet my colleague is really--I mean, the last thing I want to do is say something that is going to offend him. I mean, I will in terms of different debate, but I am not going to do it personally, because he is for real. He believes in what he is doing. 
It seems to me there is a way you could really get the flexibility for the employees and you could really accomplish the goals of that, but I do not get to say that because he is the author. He probably feels he knows best. But I am telling you right now, if you do away with the 40-hour week, you are not going to get the bill passed. 
You have this 80-hour, 2-week framework which we do not have in the House--their bill is more moderate--you are not going to get this bill passed. You have the flextime where you only get 1 hour off for 1 hour overtime, you are not going to get this bill passed. And if the penalties that my colleague talked about for coercion do not cover this kind of discrimination, then you are not going to get this bill passed.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, a couple of points I would like to make to my colleague. The first one is, we will get to some of those amendments. We filed amendments. But I have to say to my colleague that we are not likely to get to those amendments until we pass a disaster relief bill. So the first answer to his question is just that; I do not think we are going to get to these amendments until we pass the disaster relief bill. 
The second point I would make to my colleague is that I will be very interested in all of these figures. I do know that in, roughly speaking, 60 percent of the cases of families with incomes under $20,000 a year, you have a worker who depends upon overtime pay. And whether or not we are talking about women or men, it seems to me this is terribly important. Of women who work overtime, 38 percent of hourly workers earning overtime pay are women--38 percent. And 11.6 million women work over 40 hours each week. 
Let me repeat that--11.6 million women work over 40 hours each week. This is 22 percent of the working women in this country. And 6.2 million women work over 48 hours each week. This is 12 percent of working women. And 2.3 million women work over 59 hours each week. This is the 4 percent of working women. So let me just----

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-31-19970603</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just make the point if I could, Mr. President, it is really quite astounding, and it says something very fundamental about where we are in this debate. Thirty-eight percent of hourly workers earning overtime pay are women; 11.6 million women work over 40 hours each week. This is 22 percent of working women. 
Mr. President, this is not surprising. This is not surprising 
at all because we have got in our country--let me just make this clear. In our country we have a paradox. On the one hand, we have this affluence which we are grateful for, but on the other hand, we have many families who are still unable to make a decent living and raise their children successfully, and many women are working full-time and many women are working overtime. 
You have an alternative bill, if we wanted to have some give-and-take discussion, you have an alternative bill of Senator Baucus, Senator Kerrey, and others which makes it clear that what we do is take in part what the Senator from Missouri has done, but we extend it and we say, look, there are going to be penalties and we are going to have some protection against discrimination so that an employer cannot say to a woman who is working, or, for that matter, a man, look, we will give you overtime if you take comptime but we will not give you overtime pay. 
That is unacceptable. It is just simply unacceptable. And, Mr. President, that is where we say, if you will, in the words of Florence Reese, which side are you on? That is where we draw the line.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to take a question in one second. Let me just finish this. Let me just finish it real quickly. 
I have to go back to this case of whose side are you on. We are on the side of working families when we make it clear that the 40-hour week is protected. And if you work overtime, you are entitled to time-and-a-half pay. We are on the side of working families when we make it clear that if you want to get some time off to be with your families and you have worked overtime, you should get time and a half. We are on the side of working families when we have a piece of legislation that makes it crystal clear that no employer can discriminate and put people in a position where the only kind of overtime work they are going to get is if it is your comptime and not overtime pay. 
We are on the side of working families when we make it clear that for family and medical leave reasons, if you have banked your time and you have 30 hours of banked time and now you have a child sick or you have a parent that is ill, you can take that time off. You do not have to ask for permission. 
None of those features are in this legislation right now, and therefore this legislation in its present form will go nowhere. And, yes, there will be amendments on the floor of the Senate, and, yes, there will be efforts to improve this bill. But as long as I have the floor, there are not going to be any amendments until we get to the disaster relief bill. 
Now, I am not going to be able to stay on the floor forever, but that is going to be the point. 
Now, Mr. President, I want to make it clear I can only yield for questions. So I cannot yield--I think the Senator mentioned he wanted to answer, he wanted to answer what I have said, and I would ask the Chair, am I correct, the Senator--I think he may have meant it differently. The Senator said I would like to answer the question. Am I correct I can't let the Senator answer any question; I can only yield to a question? So, Mr. President, I would be pleased only to yield for a question from my colleague.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-33-19970603</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just respond to my colleague in two different ways. 
First of all, a pay cut where people are no longer able to get overtime pay or may be put in a position that they do not get overtime, time off for overtime worked doesn't help anyone. It does not help working women. It does not help working men. And it does not help working families. It is, if you will, elementary. 
Second of all, as a matter of fact, if you look at the alternative--this is what puzzled me about my colleague here. If you look at the alternative that is being presented by Senators Baucus and Kerrey and other Democrats, and I would assume there would be Republican support, as a matter of fact, that is exactly what we are talking about, which is what you have in this alternative. You have comptime--that is what it is about. It does not abolish the 40-hour week. It does not amount to a pay cut. It is time-and-a-half off for every hour you have worked overtime. It provides the protection against the discrimination so employers are not able to only give overtime to people who take comptime as opposed to people who need the overtime pay. It makes sure that you get the flexibility that we say the employees want. 
That is part of it. The other part of it is, in all due respect to some of the employers in our country, not all of them --there are, of course, many great employers--the fact is--and in the subcommittee we heard testimony to this effect. 
The fact of the matter is, right now there are all sorts of opportunities for flexibility. You don't have to overturn the Fair Labor Standards Act. People can work 4 10-hour days and then take a Friday off or a Monday off; they can work 9-hour days and work half a day Friday or take every other Friday off; people can come in at 7 and leave at 3; they can come in at 10 and leave at 6. There are employers right now that provide employees with that flexibility. 
The real problem is that a lot of employers don't give employees that flexibility. So, all of a sudden I become a little skeptical, as a Senator from Minnesota, where we put a real value on economic justice and work and families, when the very people who do not give the employees the flexibility they could right now, come in and testify to the need for this bill. I remember we had testimony from a representative of the National Federation of Independent Businesses saying, `Look, we need to do this because we can't afford to pay overtime.' All of a sudden I am saying to myself, `My gosh, this is not family friendly. This is going to lead to the functional equivalent of pay cuts. This is not about giving people the choice and flexibility they need.' 
Mr. President, we had an amendment in subcommittee. It was turned down. It's part of the alternative. It works like this: If you bank comptime and, for example, you have 20 hours that you have earned, it's your time. Now, if you have to go to your child's school, if you need to go visit with the principal or a teacher, or you need to take care of a family member, you can use your accumulated comptime to get that time off. We could do that. Then we would have real employee flexibility. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield for the Chair to make an appointment and that I not lose my right to the floor and that my resumption on the floor not be counted as a second speech.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I see that I have another 15 minutes to speak about this legislation before being able to focus my attention on my major priority here today, which is the need to get disaster relief to the people in Minnesota and the Dakotas and other States, who deserve our help. 
Mr. President, let me read a letter that I think is extremely important as we go through and debate this piece of legislation. 
Dear Senator Lott and Senator Daschle: The undersigned national organizations represent many of the working women of today. We believe passage of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, fails to offer real flexibility to the working women it purports to help while offering a substantial windfall to employers. We urge you to delay consideration until a real solution can be found which truly meets the needs of working women and families. Nearly half of the work force is women and the number of women working multiple jobs has increased more than four fold in the last 20 years. S. 4 would affect hourly workers, and most hourly workers are women. The majority of minimum wage workers are women. Many of these women depend on overtime pay. Many of them want more control of their schedules, not less. Without strong protections for workers, the comptime bill will cut women's options and women's pay. For example-- 
And I will just read slowly. 
Someone pressured into taking comp time when she really wants or needs overtime pay is taking an involuntary pay cut; 
Let me repeat that. That's an argument I have been making. These organizations which I will list in a moment are right on the mark: 
Someone pressured to taking comp time when she really wants or needs overtime pay is taking an involuntary pay cut[.] 
So, again I would say, when it comes to the enforcement machinery, you have to deal with this whole issue.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield in just one moment. I will finish reading the letter and I will be pleased to yield: 
. . . supporters argue that S. 4 is voluntary and employees have a `choice,' yet working women who have for decades faced subtle (and not-so-subtle) forms of discrimination are all too familiar with the potential consequences of not going along with the employers' wishes: isolation, intimidation and retaliation; and 
. . . because employees do not control when or if they can use their comp time, they are essentially being asked to gamble on the chance that they will be able to take time when it is as valuable to them as overtime pay. 
This is pretty important because my understanding, with Federal employees get to make that choice. That is a big difference here: 
. . . because employees do not control when or if they can use their comptime they are essentially being asked to gamble on the chance that they will be able to take time when it is as valuable to them as overtime pay. 
This is my point again. We had an amendment which would improve this bill. We could pass this bill which says: Look, you bank that time. It's your time. It's your earned compensation. If you have compelling reasons that you need that time off, sickness of child, sickness of parent--you know, what's in the Family and Medical Leave Act--you should be able to take the time off. You should not have to ask the employer. It's your time:

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond to my colleague's second question first. 
I am very well aware of the fact that Senators may want to come to the floor with amendments and I have said a number of times, and my colleague has been here during this long afternoon, I apologize for the inconvenience, but, quite frankly, right now my focus is not on whether or not some Senators can bring some amendments to this bill. 
My focus is on men, women, and children back in Minnesota, in communities, many of whom have been flooded out of their homes, have been devastated, many of whom have supported one another, have loved one another. And right now they have been waiting and waiting and waiting, and waiting, and the House of Representatives went into recess and did not pass a disaster relief bill. 
A disaster is a disaster. And an emergency supplemental is an emergency supplemental. So I am going to continue to be on the floor and I am going to continue to speak. If that means that the Senate cannot conduct business as usual, then I say to my colleague, that is the way it should be. Because, quite frankly, at this moment, at this point in time, my one priority is to fight like heck for people back in the State.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I actually will not yield for a question right now because I want to respond to the first question first. 
Mr. President, I will just say to my colleague--and I put him at a disadvantage because I have the floor right now--that based upon my knowledge of him, and I do not know his as well as I would like to, I think he would be doing the same thing. 
There comes a point in time when you do not have any other choice. You have to use your language. You have to be out there fighting for people in your State. 
We tried to appeal, I say to my colleague, in answering this question, we tried to appeal to common sense. That did not work. We tried to appeal to the goodness of people. That did not work. We tried to appeal on the basis of `we have supported you when your States have been hit with these disasters and please support us.' That did not work. 
The leadership in the House, if you can call it leadership, did something which is unconscionable. They just went into recess. It was insensitive. And now I come back and people are still waiting. We do not even know whether they are going to do it this week. 
So I say to my colleague, yes, if it means I am inconveniencing colleagues, Republicans or Democrats, I am sorry, but this is what I am going to do. And, you know, I will be here for a while and I will stay at this all week and next week if I have to, as well. I am going to fight for people in Minnesota. No apologies. 
By the way, it does not matter to me whether or not the people who were flooded out of the homes were Republicans or Democrats or Independents or none of the above. They are entitled to some assistance, and they are entitled to it now. This Senate is not going to be conducting business as usual until we get our priorities straight. 
In response to the first question, I guess this is an honest disagreement. I mean, this letter says that someone could be pressured into taking comptime when she really wants or needs overtime pay. That is what I have been talking about. I believe they are right.

Mr. WELLSTONE. But, Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that it is only in theory. My colleague has constructed this theory, and it is a theory that employees have a choice. I have organized with people at workplaces. I have worked with people who are working under conditions that I sometimes say to them, `Look, you are going to lose your hearing. Or, you're breathing in substances that are going to take years of your life.' They said, `We have no choice. This is the only job we can find.' People do not always have the choice. It is not an equal power relationship; that is not the world of the workplace. 
And even if my colleague was right--and I wish he was and this theory would turn out to be true and it would be the reality--why not, if you want a piece of legislation, why not err on the side of caution? Why not have a clear provision as in the alternative by Senators Baucus and Kerrey and Landrieu? Why not 
have clear protection against that discrimination? 
The second thing is, you can say that employees are protected from coercion, but it is not clear that that protects them from the discrimination. 
Mr. President, the third point is whether or not people will be able to take their accumulated comptime and use it when they need to. And we do not have any guarantee of that in this legislation. 
So, Mr. President, I think that the women's organizations and labor organizations that have written their letters and said, look, this is not going to help working people, are right on the mark. 
Mr. President, I also want to cover for a moment the differences between the Federal workers program and S. 4. Let me just go over some things. Federal employees--I will read for a moment--have job protections that private sector workers do not. Federal workers are covered by civil service rules requiring good cause for discharge or discipline. Private employees typically are at-will employees, who an employer can fire or discipline for any reason or no reason. As long as we are talking about parity, maybe we ought to turn this around. 
Mr. President, I would be pleased to go back to this debate later on. But now I want to focus on what I think is the most important priority for this Congress, and that is to get disaster relief to people in my State and to other States where people have been affected by the floods. 
I would like one more time to say, I am sorry. I mean, I apologize to my colleague from Missouri, and I apologize to other colleagues for the inconvenience. But I have promised myself that I would do everything I could do. And I think maybe by speaking on the floor and holding the floor, I can get attention to this unfinished business, that I can put some pressure on people here--I am just being very honest about it--and I can just fight. This is the way you fight. 
I hope, I say to my colleagues, that this disaster relief bill is put on the fast track and that people will get the work done. I want to be real clear that this has been, up until the last couple days before the Memorial Day recess, the opposite of sour. It was bipartisan. Thank you. I mean, thank you, Republicans; thank you, Democrats. We worked together. We put together a really good package. Senator Stevens was very sensitive and very committed to what we were saying and went out of his way to help. The majority leader, Senator Lott, was helping us. I do not believe that the House of Representatives being unwilling to deal with this, instead going home, was what the majority leader wanted. But this is the deck of cards that we have been dealt. 
At this point in time, it is really a moral outrage. I am going to stay at this until the Congress does the right thing for the people in Minnesota, the people in the Dakotas. 
This is an article written by Nick Coleman, Tim Nelson, and Brian Bonner, who are staff writers for the Pioneer Press. This will give colleagues a feel for why I am out here. This was written on Saturday, April 19, 1997:  
The river won. 
The Red River of the North overwhelmed months of massive efforts to keep it at bay Friday, bursting over, around and through the dikes of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, Minn., surging down evacuated streets and rapidly drowning hundreds of homes. 
Air raid sirens on both sides of the bloated river wailed ominously all day and night as first one dike, then another succumbed to the river, which in a few short hours made a mockery of the effort to contain it. 
Late last night, Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens interrupted local TV programming to urge the entire city of 50,000 people to voluntarily evacuate their homes and businesses and prepare for possible forced evacuation. 
With the Red on the rise last night to a predicted crest of 54 feet--a full 25 feet above flood stage--the overmatched dike sagged like the sides of a child's sandcastle at the beach. 
By the end of the day, several abandoned neighborhoods were swamped in roof-high water. After darkness fell, the situation appeared critical: Water had begun to seep up through downtown sewers, and the city's emergency operation center was forced to move from downtown to the outlying University of North Dakota. 
On the Minnesota side, most of East Grand Forks was under order to evacuate and 400 additional National Guardsmen were on the way to aid the city of 8,000. 
And I say to my colleagues, I was there the day that people from East Grand Forks evacuated. And the people, they were like refugees. People were dazed. 
Normally divided by the Red River, the two cities found themselves joined in misery by a spreading river that knows no borders. At nightfall, the last bridge linking them was nearly submerged. 
A should have said earlier also that one of the amazing things was the way in which--and this would be the same thing in Missouri or Kansas--people from the adjoining towns took people into their homes. It was amazing. People showed up. Even towns with all the rivalry where the high schools were always in big football games against one another, and people hardly had a good thing to say about one another, partly out of rivalry, people just welcomed their neighbors. That was the goodness of people. 
That is what is so frustrating. People have done it right. They have done exactly what they are supposed to do. They have showed a real sense of community. This Congress has showed no sense of community. People back in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and Warren and Ada, you name it, and other communities, they have shown a real sense of goodness. We have not.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I will say to my colleague, I have the floor. I made it clear, Mr. President, that I cannot believe that the House of Representatives went into recess. But it is also true--and I have thanked colleagues in the Senate for their work--but I am telling you, somebody has got to make it clear, and our colleagues from the Dakotas feel just as strongly, and they have made it clear, that business as usual is not going to go on. We will use our leverage as Senators. 
It is also true, however, that even on the Senate side, on the majority side, I am sorry to say, there is the idea that you should attach extraneous measures to the disaster bill. That is not acceptable. That was in the Senate bill. 
All this discussion about a CR, good people back in our States do not understand what in the world people are doing playing games. That is why I talk about this Congress. 
Now, Mr. President, Let me go on. 
Normally divided by the Red River, the two cities found themselves joined in misery by a spreading river that knows no borders. At nightfall, the last bridge linking them was nearly submerged. 
Soon after that, the National Weather Service issued an ominous assessment, raising the crest forecast by a foot. `This situation is unlike any flooding conditions ever experienced in eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota.' Confounded by the effects of overland flooding and a rapid melt, it was the fifth time in five days that the Weather Service had revised the crest forecast. 
It didn't take an official bulletin to inform Grand Forks residents they were in deep trouble. 
What was so sad about this, I had visited several times earlier and people did everything they could. There were high school kids out there sandbagging. It was a great community effort. People were working day and night. They started very early on. We knew we had a lot of snow. People were worried about this. They did everything they could to get ready for this. 
It didn't take an official bulletin to inform Grand Fork residents they were in deep trouble. 
The scene in the deserted Lincoln Park area of Grand Forks Friday afternoon was one of almost eerie splendor, with the sound of rushing streams of water drowning out all other noises except the whumping of Coast Guard helicopters overhead and the sirens. If it weren't for the fact that hundreds of homes were being devastated while their helpless owners waited out the flood in safety, you would think you were on the banks of an untamed northern river. 
And you'd be right. 
Millions of sandbags, millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands of hours and months of planning were not enough. Bolstered by a rise in the Red Lake River, which flows into the Red at East Grand Forks, as well as by unprecedented overland flooding to the south--upstream on the north-flowing river, the Red surpassed all expectations and its dikes with an ease that was awe-inspiring to witness. 
Water spilling over the dike several blocks to the south was rushing knee-high along Lanark Avenue, then cascading down a block-long stretch of pavement that has been transformed into a foaming spillway. 
A few blocks away, the surging river poured over a 12-foot-high dike on Lincoln Drive, roaring like a waterfall and threatening to burst, unleashing the massive amount of flood water that had been held back by the dikes until yesterday. 
Fireplace logs, plastic snowmen, sofa cushions, and chunks of ice drifted past in the rapid current, sweeping past stacks of sandbags, shovels and piles of sand. `We're sad about our city and what's happening,' Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens said tearfully. `It is very devastating to all of us. If I were to say one thing to the people of Grand Forks it would be keep the faith and we will make it through.' 
Under a bright spring sky, with lovely cumulus clouds on the horizon and birds singing nesting songs, Grand Forks was receiving the pent-up wrath of a winter of record cold and snow. Temperatures soared into the low 60's for the first time in April and residents of Grand Forks dressed in short sleeves as they turned out by the thousands in one last-ditch effort to hold some of the dikes. 
All nonessential businesses were asked to close and to steer their employees towards the front lines. Cars, pickups and National Guard trucks raced up and down the muddy streets of Grand Forks, giving the city the look of a wartime capital. 
The scene in a packed McDonald's restaurant on South Washington Street seemed right out of a disaster movie. A woman, her sweatshirt caked with mud, sobbed as she embraced a friend and told him that her house in the Riverside Park area of the town was inundated. 
Other muddy-booted patrons stood in line for a hot meal while, in the background, a TV emergency channel blared the latest warnings. 
`Riverside, Central Park, Lincoln Park areas, please leave at once,' the message said. `Critical areas at this time are the Olson Drive and Elmwood Drive areas. Take with you medication, pillow, blankets, immediate clothing needs.' 
Evacuation at dawn. 
Evacuations along the Red River started before dawn: at 5:45 a.m., the City of Grand Forks sounded emergency sirens--even though almost 1,000 people in the lowest area of the city had left their homes hours before. 
Authorities did, however, have to clear out a nursing home, relocating 106 elderly residents to the library of an elementary school a few blocks away. 
All told, 2,000 residents of nearly 800 homes along the river in Grand Forks had been ordered to leave after the river starting pouring over the dike south of downtown. 
By 10 a.m. the water was running knee deep in the streets, and by evening, it was lapping against the windowsills of a handful of the lowest homes. 
Officials estimated that more than 4,000 people--nearly 10 percent of this city's 50,000 residents--would have to find shelter elsewhere Friday night, and even more were moving away from an expected break in the city's Riverside dike. At 9 p.m., officials ordered the southern end of downtown Grand Forks to evacuate. A few hours later, the mayor made an appeal for everyone in the city to leave. 
The Minnesota side. 
On the other side of the river, East Grand Forks authority sent police cars through streets before dawn, exhorting the city's 9,000 residents to wake up and go immediately to the city's sandbagging facility to start filling bags. 
The levees on the Minnesota side of the Red River started giving way Friday morning, prompting frantic sandbagging in the city's Point neighborhood. It had been cut off after the Red Lake River--a tributary that is one half of the area's famed forks--turned out of its channel and started running overland. 
Gary Sanders, a consulting engineer who works for East Grand Forks, Minn., estimated that as many as a third of that city's homes might have to be evacuated. He and other officials spent much of the day struggling to stem the breaches in the city's dikes, hoping that massive pumps might be able to drain the area of the city along the river. 
A sandbagging operation in East Grand Forks turned into a crisis at midafternoon Friday, when part of a dike holding back the Red Lake River gave way. It sent water gushing through a neighborhood just south of the Louis A. Murray Bridge. 
Dozens of emergency crews with heavy machinery rushed first to repair the breach and then to evacuate dozens of residents from their homes. Polk County Sheriff Douglas Qualley eyeballed Murray Bridge and expressed concern about whether it would hold. 
There was reason for concern. 
`We had just got done shoring up on the west side of the bridge,' said [a volunteer]. `We went to take a break, and all of a sudden it just started coming in.' 
Mr. President, that was another impressive thing. Not only the high school students, but the ways in which all of the students--university, college, vo-tech, community college students--were out there volunteering. It is just incredible the way in which the worst of times can bring out the best in people. Sometimes I wish it would not take the worst in times. I wish we would all be like that all the time. But the students were great, really a great help.  
Within 20 minutes, the southern section of the bridge was submerged and water--sometimes settling to depths of five feet--rushed south down Third Avenue Southeast. 
Jim Maughton, an Army National Guardsman working on the bridge, said water gushed at `10,000 gallons a minute' at its peak. 
Vince and Sue Taylor, carrying a couple of plastic bags, trudged along with their two children. 
Mr. President, that gives you a feel for some of what was happening. This is Sunday, April 20, 1997. 
A city was sinking in the night. 
Occasional bursts of eerie blue light in the black sky signaled the demise of electrical transformers. 
Water boiled up from the sewers, spurting in fountains that were quickly submerged in rising water as the river sought to equalize itself on both sides of failing dikes. 
Downtown Grand Forks was going under. Dikes were giving way along both sides of the Red River of the North. 
Like some proud ocean liner fatally damaged by an iceberg, Grant Forks was dead in the water, filling up fast. And there was not a thing anyone could do but leave. 
Everywhere, between the warble of the sirens, emergency vehicles splashed through the streets, blaring warnings over loudspeakers. `All residents are ordered to evacuate this area. Get out now!' 
Signs in dorm windows at the University of North Dakota said, `Build the ark.' But arks weren't necessary in the darkness separating Friday from Saturday, struggle from catastrophe, hope from despair.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague that actually the conference committee is meeting to do their work right now and that goes on right now. Believe me you, when the conference committee finishes its work and we get this piece of legislation, then we will move on it right away and I will not be on the floor then. I think my colleague confuses matters a little bit in the terms of the sequence of all of this. 
I remind my colleague one more time that the only reason--we should not be ahistoric. We only have to go to the question, why am I on the floor now? The only reason I am on the floor is because after all the work that we did in a bipartisan way to get help to people who really needed some certainty that they would receive some assistance, the House of Representatives' leadership decided not to do the work. They did not agree to let through what we do not disagree on. They did not do their work, and they went on vacation. 
Now we are back here and I am on the floor of the Senate today, you bet, to signal to colleagues in the House and my colleagues here, let's get it done and get this bill out and stop playing games. 
As to the inconvenience, toward my colleagues on other legislation which is important, I am really sorry, but in all due respect I do not think there is anybody here that is as inconvenienced by my holding the floor for a little bit of time today as are the people of Minnesota and the Dakotas. They are in the 
ones inconvenienced. They were inconvenienced by the House leadership refusing to do the work and just going on vacation. They have been inconvenienced by the games that people have played with this, attaching amendments dealing with a continuing resolution. People do not know a thing about continuing resolutions in Grand Forks or East Grant Forks nor should they have to. 
They have been inconvenienced by other amendments that have been put on this bill. 
I refer back to the St. Paul Pioneer Press editorial, in which the argument was made that it was important to stop playing games. 
Mr. President, people are not stupid. People are intelligent. They know full well when they see Representatives or Senators using their pain as leverage. They know what is going on. 
So, Mr. President, I again read an editorial. Believe me, there are plenty of editorials like this in papers in our States. 
Congress can't resist political gamesmanship. 
Congress has breezed out of town, leaving Washington for a long holiday recess. Despite evidence to the contrary, congressional bigwigs figured satisfying their political egos was more important than expediting flood relief legislation that would aid, among other backwaters, Minnesota and the Dakotas. 
So, Mr. President, let me just be crystal clear about what is going on here. I come to the floor today to focus on priorities. And the priority should be simple. The priority for the House of Representatives and the Senate, for the conference committee, for our Congress this week, should be to pass a disaster relief bill. And I am going to make it very difficult for people to conduct business as usual until we do that. I think the Chair would do the same thing if it was Kansas. I really do. I am sorry to speak for the Chair. I know he can't speak. But I really think that it doesn't have a heck of a lot to do with party. It just has a lot to do with you just do what you can do to fight the people, and this is the way for me to do it. 
Mr. President, since I have spoken a lot about what has not happened so far and what needs to happen, let me talk a little bit about Breckenridge. I have not spoken much about Breckenridge, MN.  
In the dark, water lapped up the streets, moving as inexorably as the hands on a clock. 
This is a piece, again, in the Pioneer Press by Nick Coleman. 
Breckenridge was going under; the flood had outflanked the city's dikes. 
In the worst flooding so far this season, hundreds of homes and businesses on the south side of Breckenridge were caught by a rapidly rising second flood crest that took the city off-guard and quickly became more devastating than the first wave of flooding that hit 10 days ago. 
Bleary-eyed city officials, assisted by bone-tired troops from the Minnesota Army National Guard, evacuated 400 residents Monday night and Tuesday, trying desperately to keep the city of 3,700 from going completely under. 
Mr. President, I would really like to thank the National Guard. I have not done that today. They have done a great job. It is incredible. 
So many people back in Minnesota and the Dakotas have done a great job, and we have done such a miserable job here. I am not delaying disaster relief. My colleagues are delaying disaster relief. And as soon as the supplemental bill is ready to bring before the Senate, bring it before the Senate. Believe me, I will not stand in its way. This is entirely in the hands of my colleagues. It is entirely in the hands of my colleagues what happens. And I intend to be on this floor for some period of time to make it crystal clear that I am not going to be silent until we do the right thing here. It is that simple. 
I ought to add that tomorrow evening the flood Senators will come to the floor and speak from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. on the need for disaster assistance. I will get a chance to speak at 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. Do you know that 3 hours isn't enough time? I mean, there isn't enough time to try and make the case to my colleagues to do the right thing and please get the help to people. 
By Tuesday evening, parts of south Breckenridge were under 5 or more feet of water and the floodwaters continued to swell. The water was so deep that when a 5-ton Army truck veered off the curb, a National Guardsman was shoulder deep in the driver's seat, craning his neck to keep his chin above water and reaching down to the submerged gears to drive it out. An exhaust stack kept if from stalling. 
Residents dumped loads of dirt near a railroad line that cuts across town, hoping to stop the flood halfway through the city. 
But officials worried the flood would encircle them from the north. Efforts to sandbag around a nursing home failed after a night of effort. 
Dorothy Pierce, 77, came out of her house on the strong back of a 19-year-old National Guard trooper named Conrad Anderson, a specialist with the Duluth-based Co. C of the 434th Main Supply Battalion. Anderson ferried Pierce from her house on Second Street through the darkness in hip-high water to the safety of a Guard truck. 
`I just moved here from Nebraska in November,' Pierce said while sitting uncomfortably on a canvas tarp in the back of the truck as it made its bumpy way back to high ground. `We don't do stuff like this in Nebraska. I got here just in time for the biggest blizzard I ever saw and the only flood I ever saw.' 
Evacuated with Pierce was her son, Lonnie, his wife, Debbie, and the couple's three young children, Jena, 8, Donald, 6, and Dillon, 2. The children, sitting on the floor and clutching their mom, could be heard crying in the pitch-black covered troop carrier as it drove through the flood. 
Mama, I'm scared and I'm cold and it's dark,' Jena said to Debbie Pierce. `There's nothing to be scared of,' Debbie Pierce reassured her children, hugging them tight. `We're all safe.' 
But under a hazy half moon and in a biting chill, Breckenridge was on red alert. 
Crews of sandbaggers labored through the night Monday in a vain attempt to stave off the wandering Bois de Sioux River, which jumped its banks and went overland, creeping into the city from the unprotected southeastern side. 
Everywhere, diesel engines throbbed as dump trucks carrying sand, flatbed trucks carrying as many as 50 volunteer sandbaggers and National Guard trucks on midnight mercy missions roared up and down the streets and slogged into the rising tide. 
But the situation was critical, the weather nasty and the outcome in doubt. 
`We face a real possibility of the whole town going under,' police Chief Dennis Milbrandt told the National Guard's Col. Gary Sigfrinius Tuesday morning as crews prepared to construct a makeshift dirt dike along the railroad tracks that separate the city's north and south sides. 
Nearby, three 5-ton Army trucks slowly splashed through cab-high waters on Fifth Street, carrying 41 elderly residents of a senior citizens apartment building that was being evacuated as water poured into the first floor. 
Reaching the still-dry railroad tracks, the gray-haired evacuees, clutching suitcases and wearing blankets to ward off the 30-degree temperatures and 7-degree wind chill, were helped off by teen-age Guard troops. 
`I never thought I'd have to be fed by the Red Cross,' said 79-year-old Margaret Olson as she was lifted in her wheelchair from the back of an Army truck. `I've had three strokes and colon cancer but this is something very different and I'm happy to be on dry ground again.' 
Lonnie Pierce, Breckenridge's utility director, said the rapid rise of the floodwaters had inundated both his family's home and his mother's home. After hours of battling with sump pumps and sandbags to try to save their homes, the Pierces had been forced to make a choice: Save the family or save the house. 
`It came in awful quick here, awful high,' said Pierce, 36. `Christ Almighty, we'll lose a lot of houses,' he said, peering out the back of the truck as it chugged slowly past the silent, flooded homes of his neighbors, pushing a gentle wake through the black waters that lapped against the houses. 
`There's just no end to this. We haven't gotten one break. All this water was out there and we couldn't do anything about it. It was bound to come.' 
Located where two swollen rivers--the Bois de Sioux and the Otter Tail--join to form the Red River of the North, Breckenridge picked a poor campsite. 
Forecasters thought the Red River's record crest of 19.18 feet at Breckenridge last week was as high as if was going to get. But the river was at 19.10 and rising at midday Tuesday, with officials fearing it could pass 20 feet. 
The first round of flooding damaged the city's north side, as the Otter Tail River overflowed. This time, it is the Bois de Sioux cascading into `South Breck,' as residents here call the south side of the city. 
I am going to go on, Mr. President, and read just for the Chair. I have been speaking this afternoon about a couple of different issues. But most of the time I have been focusing on the need to get disaster relief to my home. I again apologize to my colleagues who have not been able to bring amendments to the floor and to those who came and maybe didn't want to hear one speaker speak all day. But this is just an impossible situation. 
I mean we have had people that have been flooded out of their homes. Almost everybody in East Grand Forks had to leave. We have schools and hospitals destroyed in towns like Ada, and people have done everything right. They have supported one another. And we are supposed to get some relief to them. Instead, people have been playing political games in the House of Representatives. Rather than getting the work done, they went on vacation. They went on recess. They didn't even have the decency to provide the assistance to people. 
Now we are back in conference committee, and people are playing games. 
So I am using my leverage as a Senator to be out here and to say we are not going to have business as usual for a while, and I am going to fight for people in my State. That is why I am out here reading about this flooding. 
This flooding is much more severe than the first and the potential is worse yet: Breckenridge is looking down a three-barreled gun, with the possibility that the Red, the Bois de Sioux and the Otter Tail may meet in the middle of town. 
`This whole year has just sucked,' said Beth Meyer, a 35-year-old hairstylist who rode a National Guard truck into her flooded Seventh Street home after midnight to help evaluate her 10-year-old daughter, Samantha, and the family poodle, Whitney Houston. 
Meyer's husband, Mark, and 13-year-old son, Kyle, remained behind, sandbagging and pumping to try to save the house. 
In January, the roof caved in on the salon where Meyer works in Wahpeton, ND, across the Red River from Breckenridge. For the past three weeks, the Meyers and other South Breck residents have gone without phone service and been forced to go to an emergency phone bank outside the Wilkin County Courthouse, which itself was closed by floodwaters Tuesday. 
The National Guard has taken over the school where the Meyer children already have missed four weeks due to blizzards and flooding. And since the first flood crest hit the city 10 days ago, the family has not been able to flush its toilets. If they needed to relieve themselves, cans were required. 
Wearing a heavy Army jacket lent to her by a trooper, Beth Meyer maintained an exasperated sense of humor about the never-ending battle. 
`We call this the Year from Hell,' Meyer said as she gathered up her daughter in the dark. 
`We're the South Breck Islanders. We're already talking about the party we're going to have this summer, if it ever dries out. We're all going to get together for an island party and we're going to have a little rubber pool in the middle of the street. With a sump pump in it.' 
`This is very scary stuff,' said Scott Wermerskirchen, a 35-year-old science teacher who was helping out at a barricade Monday night. `I don't want to think about what will happen if we get an inch of rain. We might as well write a big check and shut the town down.' 
Although Breckenridge was continuing the fight, there was a palpable edge of discouragement in the chilly air Monday night and Tuesday morning, with the mood of the residents deflating with each increase in the water level. 
`We got up this morning thinking we didn't have anything to worry about,' said Kirk Peterson as he navigated in a fishing boat through the 5 feet of water in his back yard at 2 a.m. Tuesday. 
The floodwater was almost up to the top of his garage door and was running through the first floor of the house where he and his wife, Jackie, live on Second Street. 
`So much for finished oak floors,' Peterson said acidly, using a flashlight to peer through the window in to his darkened home. 
Peterson, a salesman, and his wife are `River Rats,' meaning they belong to a Department of Natural Resources program designed to preserve and clean up state rivers. With his flashlight, Peterson illuminated a sign in his flooded window: `Please Keep the River Clean,' it said. 
Peterson and a friend, Errow Hensch, maneuvered their boat to a clothes pole in the back yard. Monday morning, when he first measured the rising waters, 11 inches of the pole were under water. By 8 p.m., 51 inches were under. And at 2 a.m. Tuesday, as his boat bumped against passing ice chunks and the strangely orange moon glittered off the water, the tide had risen to an even 5 feet. 
`I hate to say it, but I wonder whether this whole city won't really go under,' Peterson said as he steered the boat to help rescue a neighbor, Dave Shockley. `If we were smart, we would all have moved out in February.' 
Mr. President, as it turns out, Breckenridge was hit hard with flooding but not totally flooded out, and people are rebuilding and people are celebrating. Yes, they are celebrating the help that they gave one another. And I say to the Chair, because I know of his own small business background and his commitment to small business, it was in Breckenridge that I really first got a feel for what the small business people were thinking about. They took me to their businesses which had just been destroyed by the flooding, and they said to me, look, Paul, or Senator, we are hearing about the Federal Emergency Management assistance, and we know they can do some repair for the infrastructure in the town, and then we are hearing about the Small Business Administration loans, but we can't cash-flow loans. It will not do us any good at all. 
So all of us in a bipartisan effort got together, and we put together a good disaster relief bill with about $500 million in CDBG money for all the States affected. But this CDBG money was going to give the States, Mr. President, the flexibility to get some direct grant money to some of the businesses, and homeowners who needed it who could not cash-flow any more loans. 
And that is what people are still waiting on. People do not know whether or not they are part of a buyout if they are living in a floodplain. People wonder, do we leave or do we stay? If we leave, are we going to have assistance? Is that coming? The State cannot make plans to do that. The cities cannot make plans to do that. The small businesses are still waiting. People are getting discouraged, and people are getting pretty angry. Frankly, they are probably angry at all of us. They are probably angry at all of us except for some of my colleagues from North Dakota, who have just been out here over and over again, and South Dakota and some of the other States; they have been speaking out. 
But people just cannot understand the code here. They cannot figure it out. I think what people are thinking is, look, it is simple--in fact, it is a little embarrassing to me because after we passed that disaster relief bill, I was so excited I did what I think the Senator from Wyoming would do. I got on the phone and had a conference call with lots of the small papers in smaller communities--big communities and big papers in heart--and I said we have passed this; it really looks good. And then, all of a sudden, all of a sudden now we have the games being played and people are thinking, well, we have leverage on this. We want to have leverage later on on the budget and on the appropriations bills so we have to have a continuing resolution. 
You can do that separately. Do it on something else. Just do not play around with the lives of people who are really in a lot of pain. 
Now, as I said earlier, if I cannot persuade people to just please back off of that for now, then get the work done right now and pass this bill and get it to the President. The President is going to veto it. He already said he was because of the continuing resolution. So the President will veto it. He has to do that. And then you can show that the President vetoed it and maybe you have embarrassed him, if that is what you are trying to do, and then let us pass it clean. Let us get all the provisions off this bill that do not have anything to do with making sure that people can rebuild their lives in Minnesota and the Dakotas. 
That is all people are asking. So if you want to play your game, play it. I do not think you should, but if you want to play your game, play it, but why don't you play it in the next couple days. Because I will tell you something, if not, at least on the Senate side, whenever I have an opportunity to be out here and hold the floor, I am going to do it and we are not going to do a lot; we are not going to do much else. I put the people from East Grant Forks right now ahead of my colleagues in the Senate. I just think that Mayor Stauss and Mayor Owens and other mayors have waited too long. So whatever we need to do, whatever I need to do as a Senator, I am going to do. 
Mr. President, this is another piece. And there has been some really good writing because the journalists that were covering 
this, they saw the pain. They knew what it was in personal terms. They saw the courage of people. They saw the devastation, but they saw just that incredible determination. 
But for some reason here in Washington, DC, starting with that `leadership' in the House--I say leadership in quotes; we never translate it into personal terms--the leadership in the House decided to go on vacation. It is not what the majority leader of the Senate wanted them to do. It is not what my colleagues here wanted them to do, but that is what they did. 
That is why I am in the Chamber. And now I am reading that we may not pass this this week. That is just outrageous. So, Mr. President, just so my colleagues know, I probably will maybe stay in the Chamber for about another 50 minutes or so, up to about 7 o'clock, and then I think I will have had time to talk about this today, and I will come back tomorrow and figure out a way of getting in the Chamber again, if I can. 
By the way, Mr. President, I really should also mention that--I mentioned FEMA, James Lee Witt. I also wish to thank SBA, the Small Business Administration. What I said about some of the businesses that are worrying about cash-flowing more loans is true. But SBA, they have been on the ground. They have tried to help. The State people have been marvelous. The State office, Jim Franklin at emergency management assistance, that office has been great. Legislators have cared. The Governor has cared. Really, in our States, we are just forgetting the party part, trying to help people. And I want to just make it clear that a lot of people deserve a lot of thanks. 
So, Mr. President, I will continue to talk about this. I want to make note of the fact that Senator Dorgan had come down to the floor earlier, and he is right now tied up in a meeting on the disaster conference report. They are in conference, meeting on it, getting ready for it, and that is going to be key. We are going to need Senator Dorgan's help. But I would just say to members of the committee, thank you for your commitment. The good news is we worked together in a bipartisan way and we had something good going and people really appreciated it and we did exactly what we are supposed to do: provide people with some relief. 
The bad news is then people started playing games, and then people decided not to even finish their work and had the insensitivity and the gall to just go home, go home. It is amazing to me how some people can be so generous with the suffering of others. Can you imagine a group of legislators--and now, I say to my colleague from Missouri, I am speaking specifically about leadership in the House--saying, oh, well, you know, we got these disagreements and we can't get our work done. We can't resolve this. So they go home. That is being very generous with the suffering of a whole lot of people in the country, including people in Minnesota. 
Well, Mr. President, we can have all of these arguments about what is in the pipeline, what is not in the pipeline. We heard from Mr. Raines today from the Office of Management and Budget that a lot of this, a lot of this money is not going to get out there to the communities. 
I talked earlier about buyouts in construction. I told you Minnesota is a cold-weather State. We have to get the work done now because come mid-October or the end of October, we are not going to have time to do this at all. So one more time I would say to my colleagues, some of whom have been inconvenienced today, I apologize, but, in all due respect, the problem of time is a bigger problem for the people in Minnesota and North Dakota because time is certainly not on their side. 
Think about this. There was a piece that I read earlier about the little girl who just sort of had a vacant look in her eyes and was really looking down and not playing like you hope and pray a child would play. We know what has happened. Just imagine, I say to people, what it would be like to be completely wiped out with a flood and no longer have your home and be homeless and then people in other towns take you in. That is Minnesota. But I bet you it 
is every State. I love to brag about Minnesota, but I bet it is in every State. The goodness of people comes out and people take families in and all the rest. But it is hard for families because you go back, now the water has receded, now you have to go back to your homes and now you have to look at this devastation and there it is before you. And you do not know what is going to happen next. 
If you have lived in the floodplain, are you now going to move? If you haven't, are you going to have the money to rebuild your home? And you are just there and you do not know where you stand. And you hear that the Federal Government is going to help. 
You better believe that over the years when my colleagues have come to the floor from Missouri or from California or from Florida and they have said we need help, there has not even been any question in my mind. 
Well, that is the situation right now. The only question is, where is the soul of the Congress. I say to my colleague from Missouri, where is the soul of the leadership of the House of Representatives, who do not even get the work done and send back a bill to us. Well, this time, this week there is going to be a conference committee and they are going to do the work. I feel they will do the work. I believe my colleagues will spearhead that. We are going to get this done. And as I said before, the best of all worlds will be, please, just keep all the extraneous political stuff off. 
Let's just pass a clean disaster relief bill and get the money out there to people, get the help out there to people. 
Mr. President, let me just read about Chip Rankin. I started to talk about him.  
[He] looked tired in his National Guard fatigues, stood in the pulpit of the Immanuel Lutheran Church on Sunday, reading aloud from the Gospel of St. Luke, [this is from the Pioneer Press of April 14] recounting how the apostles, frightened by a storm on the Sea of Galilee, wake Jesus from a nap and beg him to rebuke the raging waves. 
An hour later, the 22-year-old wrestler-- 
Mr. President, did you hear that? Wrestler. Now we're really talking. 
At the University of Minnesota-Duluth would find himself in troubled waters. 
By the way, Mr. President, while I am speaking about wrestling, the University of Minnesota-Duluth had their wrestling program shut down. It was a real shame. The title IX program is a great program. I mean, as a father of a daughter who loves athletics and is a good athlete, and having one granddaughter, the idea of full participation of girls and women in athletics is right on the mark. But the shame of it is, in a lot of these schools, in order to reach parity, what they do is go after the minor men's sports, the sports that don't have the clout. It's a political issue, I say to my colleagues. The University of Minnesota lost their wrestling program. A real shame. 
Mr. President, I am not without my biases, since I wrestled and love wrestling. I do think it is a real shame. There has to be some way to make sure this doesn't happen around the country. It is so unfair, gymnastics, swimming, other minor sports--who gets to define what's a minor sport? Baseball. 
Rankin and a Guard sergeant were caught in a frightening torrent of water that threatened to wash his 2 1/2 -ton troop truck off a Norman County highway and into a forbidding sea of ice and water. Rankin's truck lurched and sagged, plunging into holes that were rapidly forming in the crumbling highway while a Hovercraft and men with ropes stood by in case they had to attempt a desperate rescue in the icy current. 
God, and the National Guard, would come through. But it was close. 
To some, it might sound like just another day on the Red River of the North, this spring of record flood. But it wasn't just another day. It was the Lord's day. A day when the weary people of Hendrum--those who haven't fled the flood--paused in their struggle against the water that surrounds them on three sides to worship in an extraordinary ecumenical service. 
This was written by Nick Coleman. `Faith and the flood. It was a time of prayer, reflection and drama as Sunday came to the Red River of the North.' 
You knew it was going to be a different kind of service when you saw Rankin line up a dozen troops and march them, single file, into the church, reminding them to doff their camouflage caps. This wasn't a ho-hum Sunday go-to-meeting with everyone freshly scrubbed and in their Sunday best. This was a battlefield prayer meeting, with the enemy on the horizon and coming on fast. 
It was a `come-as-you-are' service where the pastor sported a week's worth of grizzled whiskers and refused to take an offering because, he said, the people in the pews had been offering all week and giving all they could give. A service in a church where people have been sleeping in the basement and the congregants had mud on their boots and exhaustion on their faces. Where men and women wept without shame. Where some folks had to scoot out during the sermon to check on the pumps keeping the waters at bay. Where helicopters chattered overhead and where everyone looked at each other when the lights flickered, it being only a couple of days since the town got its power restored. Where the mayor read from Genesis about `the spirit of God hovering above the waters,' and the police chief's daughter sang, `Yes, Jesus Loves Me.' And where the psalm they chose for the day, Psalm 46, praised `a river whose streams make glad the city of God.' 
The Red River isn't in the Bible. But it has taken on Biblical proportions. And, for generations, through flood and drought, blizzard and blight, the response of the people along the river, many of them the descendants of devout Norwegian Lutherans, has been to roll up their sleeves and to put their trust in their God. Praise the Lord and pass the sandbags. Or, as they simply say in Hendrum, `toss 'em.' 
That was the tone at Immanuel Lutheran. . .. 
Mr. President, I notice that my colleague from North Dakota is here. I would be pleased to yield for some questions, if my colleague has some questions. And then, if my colleague, who I know has been out here over and over again and back in North Dakota, wants to speak, then I would at that point in time--I would then ask consent to yield. But right now let me just ask my colleague whether he has any questions and respond to some questions. Then we will see what kind of unanimous-consent agreement we can get.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am. It is a very important point. I say to my colleague from North Dakota that the key thing--and both efforts are equally important--that people need the short-term relief, but people need to think about how they rebuild their lives and whether they have a future. And that is what is so unconscionable about this delay and the House going on vacation before getting this work done. 
I would say that to my colleague.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-25-19970603</DOCNO>

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I respond to my colleague that this is also an important point. The buyout of the homes in the floodway is key to the future for people. And the only way this can be done is through the CDBG money that is being held up right now. 
And I say to my colleague from North Dakota, who knows this so well, that the awful thing is that so many people do not know where they stand. They do not know whether to move, not to move, where they are going to have a home. They do not know where they are going to be, where their children are going to be? People have been through enough, I would say to my colleague. 
Why do we want to heap more pain on the people who have already been through so much pain? That is what is unforgivable about this delay. That is what is unforgivable about political games. That is what is unforgivable about our failure to just get the relief to people, to get this emergency supplemental bill passed. It is an emergency. Just get the disaster relief to the people.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senator from North Dakota has posed that question to me because I have been remiss in not focusing on livestock producers. The importance of funding that is not in the pipeline has everything in the world to do with whether our ranchers and producers are going to be able to get back on their feet. 
So I say to the Senator, yes, I am aware of it. That is yet another example of families in our States--agricultural producers, who work so hard and are waiting for some help. 
And I say to the Senator from North Dakota, earlier I quoted him because I heard the Senator say, the question is, how many more days do people have to wait? How many more days do the homeowners have to wait? How many more days do the small businesses have to wait? How many more days do ranchers, livestock producers have to wait? So I am aware of that.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to respond to the questions because this is exactly what is going on. The Senator is raising these questions, and I am responding. And I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, because this is again another area that I really did not speak about and I should have. 
It has been wonderful to see different school districts, a neighboring school district taking students and making sure they do not have to drop out of school, making sure they can graduate. That has been happening in Minnesota and North Dakota. That is the goodness in people. 
I do not see much goodness in this Congress right now. I do not see much goodness in the House. I think we make a mistake when 
we go on vacation and do not come through for people. 
I am aware of the fact that these schools are now waiting for some assistance for the extra costs that they have incurred in taking in other students and making sure those students graduate. And so I say to my colleague, I am aware of this, but I am glad he has emphasized this in the question that he has put to me.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota raises a very important question that I will respond to. And the question that he raises has to do with the effect of the delay both in a material sense in terms of economic resources but also in almost as serious a way, the way in which it erodes people's--it is personal-- People need some certainty. People need to be able to plan for the future. People need to get through this. 
This is a very difficult time. And our failure to act does not give people that confidence, does not give people that support. Moreover, I say to all my colleagues, in responding to the question from the Senator from North Dakota, the failure to act, the failure to get help to people, the playing of political games, has done an awful lot of harm. It has soured people and eroded people's confidence. That is a terrible mistake. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North Dakota that I am about ready to yield the floor in any case.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-3-19970523</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President and Senators, the budget is all about priorities. This amendment speaks to priorities. This amendment says that we invest in crumbling schools all across our country $5 billion, that we should do that now. This amendment says that, while we have made progress with Head Start in this budget agreement, still only half the children, if you consider early Head Start, are covered and we should cover more of these children. This amendment says that last year we made cuts in the school breakfast program, we made cuts in the child nutrition programs for Family Head Start Centers, and therefore we ought to restore that nutritional funding for poor children in America. 
Madam President, altogether this amendment says we make investments in these areas to the tune of about $20 billion over the next half decade, and the offset is to make sure that the cuts in taxes are targeted to middle income and small business, not the top 2 percent of the economic profile in the country, and that we look at all of these loopholes and deductions in corporate welfare.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, my colleagues on the other side do not want to have an up-or-down vote on whether or not they are willing to invest in child nutrition programs and whether or not they are willing to invest in rotting schools. Instead of this increased investment, they want to now vote on the proposition that we have funds that go in an unlimited, unconditional way through a private voucher plan. That is what this vote is all about.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I proposed the amendment with Senator Reed, and also as cosponsors are Senator Bingaman and Senator Moynihan. 
This amendment, I say to my colleagues, expands the Pell grant program. It takes it up to $3,500. It is authorized up to $4,500 right now. It is a commitment of about $6 billion over 5 years. This will help thousands of families. 
This will make a huge difference, especially to families with incomes of about $25,000 to $30,000 who, more or less, fall between the cracks on some of the other assistance that we are giving. So it is very targeted. It is very effective. The money comes from loopholes and deductions. 
We could be talking about tens of billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars, in that. Just invest a little more in the Pell grant program. This is extremely important to working families in our country.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we will agree to a voice vote on this amendment. 
With all due respect to my colleague, whom I greatly respect, No. 1, this second-degree amendment strikes out all the investment, so as opposed to plugging some of the loopholes in corporate welfare we make no investment in the expansion of Pell grants. That is what this vote is about. 
No. 2, you can talk about savings. Families with incomes under $20,000 a year--since 1979, 8 percent of them, women and men from those families, have been able to graduate from college. Do you not think we ought to make sure they get assistance?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me also thank Senator Moseley-Braun for bringing this amendment to the floor of the Senate. And I am very proud to support her and be an original cosponsor. 
Mr. President, I am just going to build on a few remarks that have been made. There are 14 million children learning in substandard schools; and 7 million children attending schools with asbestos, lead paint, or radon in the ceilings or walls. 
Mr. President, this really is a scandal. This is really unconscionable. And this amendment goes to the heart of the question of priorities. What this amendment says is that rather than continuing to spend the hundreds of billions of dollars in a variety of different loopholes and deductions, billionaire tax breaks and all, transfer $5 billion over 5 years and put that into investing to rebuild our schools that are crumbling all across America. 
I suggest to my colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, or Senator Durbin, that I really believe that in many ways this is the priority vote. I really do, because it is just too dear a price to pay to refuse to go after some of these loopholes and deductions, never mind the fact that behind the loopholes and deductions are the heavy hitters and the people who are connected and the people who have the clout. 
This is all about who gets represented in the Senate. It is too dear a price to pay to not ask for a little bit of sacrifice over here and plug some of these loopholes or deductions and not make this investment. 
As I look at this budget agreement right now--I will be speaking about it more this afternoon with an amendment that I have on the floor of the Senate; so I want to stay within the framework of Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment--I just ask the question, where are the funds to rebuild schools that are crumbling all across our Nation? There is not one penny. 
Where are the funds--we went through this yesterday--to get health care coverage to every child who lacks it? We are still not willing to do that. 
And I say that any budget that does not provide at least some funds to begin to rebuild some of the schools in our country, schools that are crumbling all across the Nation, is hardly a budget that represents a bridge to the next century. This is not a budget that represents a bridge to the next century. Not one penny is invested in our crumbling schools. 
Mr. President, this is wrong. I wish we could just do an instantaneous poll and get the results in, because I know that people in the country would say it is wrong that 14 million children learn in substandard schools, it is wrong that 12 million children go to school under leaky roofs, it is wrong that 7 million children attend schools with asbestos, lead paint. 
How well could we do our jobs if we were here and the toilets did not work and the heating systems did not work or the air-conditioning did not work, and we were cold during the winter, hot during the summer, if there was asbestos or lead paint, the ceilings and the walls were decrepit? 
It is not that way here. This is splendor. And thank God that it is. This is the Nation's Capitol. Can't we have some of this splendor for children in America? 
In all due respect, we are getting way ahead of the curve with 
$35 billion that goes to tax credits, deductions for college. I was a college teacher. Fine. But we have to get our children to the point where they are able to attend higher education. That does not happen unless we make this investment. 
This is the amendment. Do we continue to just fork out lavish subsidies to billionaires and large multinational corporations that do not need them or do we at least begin to make the investment in the schools that are crumbling all across this country? 
This speaks to the very issue of justice and fairness. This is a critically important amendment. I hope we will pass it. 
I thank the Senator from Illinois.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will have an opportunity to have an amendment and speak on it a little later this afternoon, so let me be very brief. 
I rise to support this amendment that Senator Kerry has introduced. I think more than anything else it is an amendment that almost asks us to engage in some reflection. It does not call for spending any additional money. It asks us to pause and think deeply about our priorities and at least consider the possibility that we might eventually be able as we go through this reconciliation process to make some significant investment in these very critical and very important early years. 
As a former college teacher, and I think more importantly as a parent and grandparent, I am absolutely convinced from my own experience and from spending time in a school in Minnesota about every 2 or 3 weeks during the school year we have to get to the point where every child who comes to kindergarten has been read to widely, that we have to get to the point where every child who comes to kindergarten knows the alphabet and knows how to spell his or her name, knows colors, shapes, and sizes. And we have to get to the point where every child who comes to kindergarten comes with that sort of wonderful readiness to learn. 
The critical challenge for all of us, which kind of speaks to what we are really about, speaks to what our goodness is, is to make sure that each and every child enters kindergarten with this wonderful readiness to learn. The problem is that for all too many children this does not happen. I am sure that Senator Kerry has referenced so much the neuroscience evidence that is coming out now. I think we know what to do. I do not think it is true we do not know what to do. And we just have to get it right. There is sort of an interconnection of the nutrition part and the health care part and the intellectual development and child care part and we have to do much better for children in this country. 
Hopefully this amendment will be an amendment that will generate bipartisan support. I think it is a plea. I think it is a call upon all of us to reflect. It is an effort to say to all of us, think deeply and let us, at least, hold out the possibility as we move through this reconciliation process we can invest in these children and their opportunities. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North Dakota, I am pleased he raised this question. I certainly want to speak about this amendment. I think it goes to the heart of the question of what the budget is about. But I think it is important to take a few moments right now in the Chamber to speak about this. I say to the Senator from North Dakota I know how hard he has worked on this for people in North Dakota. I know how hard Senator Conrad has worked. I know how hard Senator Grams, the other Senator from Minnesota, has worked and Senator Johnson and Senator Daschle. 
I just think that would be unconscionable. I hope this does not happen, the House of Representatives going into recess without getting the work done. Because in this particular case --it is quite one thing to say we want to get the work done, for example, on the budget, though the truth of the matter is 10 days from now the budget could be done and it really would make no difference. In this particular piece of legislation, we are talking about emergency assistance for people. This needs to be done right away. 
So I say to my colleague, we cannot adjourn. I mean there is no way we can adjourn until this work is done. He is quite right in the question that he put to me.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I respond to both my colleagues--and please understand I think about what is happening to the people in Grand Forks. Everybody had to leave their homes. Those people were refugees. I know the pain of the people in East Grand Forks and other communities of Minnesota. 
I say to both my colleagues that this is a nightmare. I just--this is a nightmare. I guess I never would have believed it, that we are on the floor right now--this is away from the amendment. We will get back to it, I say to the Senator from New Jersey. But my colleagues come to the floor and raise these questions. 
This is a nightmare. I never would have dreamed that there would even be any thought that we would go into recess without finally providing this assistance to people. People need this. These people are trying to figure out how to get back to their homes. People are homeless. 
We cannot--we cannot--leave without doing this. I have heard that over in the House there is some discussion they are going to just adjourn. 
I just make a plea to Democrats, Republicans, and the independent in the House, everybody, every breed of political person, regardless of your point of view, please do not do this. I think from our point of view, it is just unacceptable. 
I mean, I think all three of us are saying, we just cannot have a Congress going into recess without passing through at least this emergency assistance. What people do not agree on, I say to both my colleagues, they can set aside; but what we cannot set aside is this emergency. 
Let me emphasize that word again, `emergency' assistance that people need. They need it now. It would be the worst possible thing for this Congress to go into recess without providing this.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues, and I appreciate their graciousness. I think that what both my colleagues are trying to say is we have an emergency now, and, Mr. President, I just do not think there is any way that this Congress can go into recess without passing this disaster relief bill. I mean, it is just too important. I mean, it truly is an emergency measure, and both my colleagues were speaking to that. I have told them I am in complete agreement. 
So let us hope that the House will be able to do the work. We have had great cooperation over here on the Senate side. 
Mr. President, the discussion about the budget, much of the discussion is about the balance, that this is a responsible budget, this is the responsible thing to do. 
Mr. President, let me just be really clear. I have some good friends who believe that. I respect their work. I have tremendous respect for their work. But from my point of view, as a Senator from Minnesota, when you do not invest to rebuild schools that are crumbling across this country--7 million children's schools with asbestos and lead--I do not think that is the responsible thing to do. 
When there are not the funds to assure that every child who now goes without health care still does not receive that health care, to me, that is not responsible. And when there are not the funds and there is not the investment to make sure that, in fact, there is a school breakfast program for children, for whom that really is their only nutritious meal in the morning so that they are not going to school hungry, when there is not the investment in nutrition programs to make sure children are not malnourished in America--there are some 13 million children that are now malnourished in America--that does not seem balanced or responsible to me.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from New Mexico, and on my second amendment I know I will be joined by Senator Reed from Rhode Island. 
Mr. President, this amendment that is before the Senate right now essentially says this. We make sure that the tax cuts in this budget resolution do not go to the top 2 percent of the population. We look at some of the loopholes and deductions, and what Senators have called corporate welfare. There is several hundred billion dollars that fits into this category. 
Instead, we take the following steps, which seems so reasonable. First of all, since we cut child nutrition programs by roughly $3 billion for 6 years, this amendment restores $2.7 billion. Let me repeat that: Last year, we made cuts in child nutrition programs. This amendment says, can we not take some of this out of corporate welfare? Can we not take it out of loopholes for billionaires? Can we not make sure that the tax cuts go to middle-income families and small business people and not the top 1 percent and 2 percent? And instead, could we not provide just a little bit, over 5 years, $2.7 billion, could we not invest that in nutritional programs for some of the poorest and most vulnerable children in America? They do matter. They do count. 
Mr. President, currently, there are 6.5 million children who participate in the school breakfast program. However, in many States, this program reaches only 50 percent of those eligible. In the State of Minnesota, the school breakfast program, much like the national, reaches just under 50 percent of those students eligible. 
Mr. President, what we are talking about is all across the country we have schools who are not able to participate. The welfare bill last year wiped out grants for schools to start up or expand school breakfast programs, and we have 13 million malnourished children in America. I do not know how my colleagues think some of these children will do well in school when they come to school hungry. I have talked to kindergarten teachers in Minnesota, and every single Senator here, I think, has had similar experiences with their teachers who surely say it breaks their heart to know some of the students in their class come to school hungry. 
Mr. President, there is another food nutrition program, the summer food service program. Many of my colleagues may not be aware of it, but I want you to be aware of it because these children, when they are not in school, are no longer able to receive school lunch or breakfast if that program is not available now during the summer. What we try to do is serve meals at summer schools or recreational centers or other nonprofit groups--a lunch, a breakfast or a snack--some way of making sure that these children have at least one nutritious meal a day. 
Over 14 million children, unfortunately, are low income enough to be eligible, and only 2 million are served--only 2 million are served. In Minnesota, only 16 percent of low-income children who are served throughout the school year are served during the summer. 
Mr. President, is it too much to ask to take just a little bit from loopholes, deductions for billionaires, large multinational corporations, and others that do not need it and invest a little bit in nutrition programs to make sure the children in our country have at least one nutritious meal? 
Mr. President, the Head Start Program has been discussed so there is no need for me to go into it in great detail but just to say one more time, that the President, in his budget, in this budget proposal, intends to serve an additional 1 million children. That is fine until we find out that that there are 2 million children who are eligible who are not participating. This does not even deal with Early Start, that is to say, age 2, age 1. So what this says is if we are serious about doing well for all the children in this country, surely we will dramatically expand the number of children that can participate 
in Head Start. That is worth it. That is an investment, an investment all of us can be proud of. 
Mr. President, the final part, of school construction, and I do not even need to go into it, again, this amendment says invest the $5 billion that was in the original agreement--at least that was being negotiated; it was taken out. This is too painful a contrast. On the one hand, tax cuts not targeted, going to be skewed to the very top of the population; on the other hand, not a pittance when it comes to going after corporate welfare, but being unwilling to invest in crumbling schools all across the country. 
Mr. President, let me use this amendment for a final conclusion about this budget. One more time, I have heard it said that this budget is balanced, represents balanced values. I do not see the balance. I do not see the balanced values when on the one hand the tax cuts are skewed to the top and on the other hand we do not invest in crumbling schools across the Nation. I do not see the balance when we cannot invest in nutrition programs to make sure children are not hungry in America. I do not see the balanced values when we talk about a compelling problem of children going without adequate health care and we are not willing to fully fund health care for those children. 
I think this is a budget without a soul. It is interesting what is not on the table. What is not on the table is the $12 billion more than the Pentagon wanted. That is for defense. I would have thought we could have used that for some of our investment. What is not on the table are the tax preferences to special interests that are, quite candidly, a result of those who make the large contributions and have the power. What is not on the table is the deterioration of public institutions which are supposed to be so important to the quality of our lives. If we are going to rebuild a sense of community in America, Mr. President, that means attending to this deterioration. We have fewer good schools, fewer good libraries, and too many hospitals and clinics that are unable to provide the best care. This budget does not build a bridge to the next century. We do not invest in these critical areas of life. 
Mr. President, what is not on the table, perhaps most of all, is a set of social arrangements that allows children to be the most poverty stricken group in America. There is no concept of justice or virtue that justifies our willingness to allow millions of children to suffer involuntary poverty. What principle can we possibly invoke to absolve ourselves of responsibility for the fate of children too young to comprehend their expulsion from the American promise, denied the pleasures of childhood, their natural capacity stifled, their mind and spirit under attack from birth? Their impoverishment is our disgrace and it is a betrayal of our Nation's heritage. 
Mr. President, if this balanced budget agreement is to be the great accomplishment of 8 years of a Democratic Presidency, then history will judge us harshly. This agreement is a triumph of the past. This is not a bridge to the century to come. 
Mr. President, we have lost our way. I say this to the Democratic Party, to some of my colleagues I think we have lost our way. Our party, from Jefferson to Jackson to Roosevelt to Kennedy was a party that stood for justice, a party that expanded opportunities for citizens. We have always been at our best when our party has been there for people. 
Mr. President, this budget does not represent the best of the Democratic Party. This budgets turns our Nation's gaze away from too much of what is important about America--equality of opportunity, justice, the very essence of our Nation. Mr. President, for that reason, I will vote against this budget resolution. 
Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me thank my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. The Pell grant program has been a huge success. It has sort of been the foundation of opportunity in our country. I feel like my words are also dedicated to Senator Claiborne Pell. 
Let me just highlight a few things that Senator Reed had to say. And, again, Senator Bingaman and Senator Moynihan are also original cosponsors. 
What we are really doing is saying that we are pleased to see the tax deductions. And we are pleased to see the tax credits. But we want to make sure that we also provide the support for students and families with incomes under $20,000 a year who may very well fall between the cracks. 
So what this amendment does is it says for $6 billion more over 5 years we take it out of a variety of different loopholes and deductions that are called corporate welfare. Instead, we would invest it in the Pell grant program. We would increase the award up to $3,500. 
My colleague is right. The President has brought it from $2,700 to $3,000, and that is a modest increase. But we are pleased to see that. But if we brought it up to $3,500, then what you would see is that the Pell program would be available to several hundred thousand new students and the average Pell grant among low-income students would increase by about a third. 
One of the things that I want to say to my colleagues is that I hope before you vote on this amendment that there will be a way that you can be in touch, if you are not already, with the higher 
education communities in your States, because I think you will hear over and over again from them that there is no more important program than the Pell grant program, if we want to target this assistance to make sure those students and those families most in need of assistance are able to have access to higher education. 
There is a shameful statistic in our country. The best predictor of attending college is family income. And only 16 percent of college freshmen come from households with incomes under $20,000 a year. Only half of them graduate by age 24. 
So just think about that for a moment. Only 8 percent of those women and men coming from households with incomes under $20,000 a year are able to graduate. And we are now moving toward an economy where the brainpower of women and men in industry is going to matter more and more. Many of these companies, by the way, are going to be small businesses--not necessarily large companies. And the whole key to whether or not our children and our grandchildren are going to be able to do well economically is to be able to have access to higher education. 
I mean this really speaks not only to the whole issue of opportunity but also to national security. We do well as a Nation when we make sure that women and men have access to higher education so that they can do well for themselves and their families and they can do well for our country. 
So, again, I just want to make it clear that this is the choice. We just simply take $6 billion. And believe me, you know, you are looking at hundreds of billions of dollars when you look at this whole area of tax expenditures. We say find some of those loopholes and deductions and plug them. Mr. President, $6 billion over 5 years is not too much to expand the Pell grant program up to $3,500 which would make a huge difference. 
Again, what we would be talking about is several thousand new students. The Pell grant award would increase. It would make a huge difference to low- and moderate-income families. It would make a huge difference to access to higher education. 
And if we want to talk about priorities, I don't see any reason why this amendment would not be an amendment that would carry on the floor of the U.S. Senate. There are a whole bunch of loopholes and deductions. Regular people are pretty angry about them. They don't think that those people who already make millions of dollars should get these breaks. And I think it is an absolute priority for people to make sure that higher education is affordable. 
This would really make this budget a budget with a strong higher education component. This would really make this budget a budget that I think Senators could feel really proud of when it came to higher education. Senator Reed and I are really trying to improve upon this. 
So, Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will get very, very strong support. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank again the Senator from Rhode Island. He comes from a State with a great tradition of commitment to higher education. 
To my colleagues, there are two amendments. One of them is, if you will, very precious. 
It is all about making sure that we at least provide some more funding for nutritional programs for many poor children who are malnourished in America; that we invest in Head Start; and that we invest in our schools, too many of which are crumbling across the country, and we take that out of tax cuts that are skewed to the very top and we say target those to middle-income and small businesses, and we take it out of corporate welfare. 
The second amendment Senator Reed and I offered is a higher education amendment. This makes all the sense in the world. With this additional $6 billion of outlays over 5 years, we would be talking about a dramatic increase in access to higher education for many, many families all across the country in our States. 
Mr. President, those are the two amendments. I am going to finish on a positive note, but with 30 seconds left, I will just say one thing on a negative note. I gather that I will be meeting with my colleagues from North Dakota, Minnesota, and South Dakota. Apparently the House is not going to finish the disaster relief bill. I have to say on the floor of the Senate, I cannot believe that this is happening. I think it is just unconscionable. It is irresponsible. This is emergency assistance that people in our States have been waiting for. 
We as Senators are going to have to figure out exactly what we do next, but I can assure you, and I think I speak for my colleagues, we will be as strong as we can be, and we will fight as hard as we can for people in our States. That is not meant to be showman-like. It is very sincere. 
Finally, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his graciousness. We were able to get the two amendments in in the 30-minute limit, and I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico, who is really--we say a good friend--he really is a good friend. I want him to know both of these amendments--and I am speaking for myself, not for Senator Reed--do not have a darn thing to do with TV attack ads. I cannot stand them. I wish there was no such thing. 
These amendments are offered out of a sense of sincerity, and, in all due respect to my colleague, you can talk about what we are doing in the area of, for example, nutrition for children, and it is, I guess, all a matter of how you see it. These amendments just say we can do better. The fact of the matter is that in the last Congress, we cut grants for school districts to establish the School Breakfast Program and only 50 percent of the children who are eligible receive it. The fact of the matter is----

Mr. WELLSTONE. The fact of the matter is, the same thing can be said for the Summer School Program. So, the question--I said actually a comment, but I will put it in the form of a question. My question for the Senator is, how can you even view this as some sort of potential TV attack ad when these amendments are so substantive and they speak to the huge--I am sorry, I say to the Senator--disparity between children who need this assistance and, quite frankly, a budget that does not get them anywhere near close to it? How can that be viewed just as an effort to have an attack ad?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. President, in 4 minutes it is difficult to really make a major argument on the floor of the Senate. Let me just try to pick up on a couple of comments that I heard made in the last 15 minutes of the debate. 
One of my colleagues has argued that we have to think about the future and we have to think about reducing the debt to our children in the future. I think all of us agree with that. 
Then another colleague talked about the budget agreement--the budget agreement that `is a deal, is a deal, is a deal.' The debate seems a little bit too abstract for me as a Senator from Minnesota. 
I would like to ask colleagues to confront the fierce urgency of now. The fierce urgency of now for too many children in our country is as follows: A child with poor vision, with no health care coverage and not able to get any assistance cannot see the blackboard and, in all likelihood, will not be able to do well in school and have a chance. 
The fierce urgency of now is that a child who is suffering from asthma and spending too much time in the emergency room--I have met children like this in Minnesota--though we have done a good job of covering many children with our own separate health care plan, a child who suffers from asthma with extreme attacks, unable to be able to see a physician, winding up in the emergency room too often, misses too much time from school, and he or she will not have the same chance to do well as all of our children. 
In the fierce urgency of now, I think that we ought to look at, as opposed to all of these abstractions, a child who has an abscessed tooth coming to school because her family can't afford dental care. I have met children like this. That child who is in so much pain and discomfort cannot do well in school. She doesn't have the same chance as our children. 
This budget agreement has been much lauded, and Senators have worked hard on it. But the fact of the matter is, using a conservative estimate, we are only covering half the children who are without health care coverage. 
This amendment is the right thing to do. 
I will not talk about the tobacco industry. I will not talk about why the tax makes good public-policy sense to me. But I want to say the fierce urgency of now is that this is compelling, and, if it is so compelling that our children should have the coverage, and, if it is so compelling that all the children in our country should have good health care coverage, it seems to me then that it doesn't make a lot of sense to applaud and celebrate a budget agreement that only covers half those children. 
This bipartisan effort of Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy is so important. This speaks to the goodness of our country. There is nothing that we could do that would be more important than to support this amendment. 
I hope my colleagues will do so. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues from South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota in co-sponsoring Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1977, and I do so with great enthusiasm for what this project could mean to the people in southwestern Minnesota, as well as those in Iowa and South Dakota who have serious problems finding adequate drinking water supplies. 
Many of us never really have to think about where our water comes from, but for the people in Luverne and Worthington, Minnesota, it is a constantly nagging question, Helping provide for this sort of basic need is what I think government ought to be doing. 
In a project like Lewis and Clark, governments at all levels have to work together. Municipalities, states, and the federal government each will have important roles to play, and each will have to carry a significant burden. And that is as it should be--in tough situations like this, not only is there no free lunch, but there is also no free water. 
So today I am pleased to formally state my support for the Lewis and Clark project by cosponsoring its authorization legislation. The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System project is sorely needed to provide safe drinking water on a consistent basis for citizens in the tri-state region of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa. For far too long communities in this region have faced great and sometimes overwhelming challenges in finding safe and reliable sources of water for their citizens. While many communities in our country have ample supplies of drinking water, twenty-two communities in this tri-state area are not so lucky. Shallow aquifers and high water tables have left many water systems in the region constantly searching for potable water. Even when these communities have managed to find sources of water, many times the water has been contaminated with unsafe levels of nitrates and bacteria, as well as high levels of naturally occurring iron and manganese. 
While the lack of water, reliable water sources affects the health of these citizens in the short-term, the economic vitality of these communities is adversely affected in the long-term. Rural communities cannot plan economic growth when they do not possess long-term sources of safe drinking water. Businesses are reluctant to locate in an area where such necessities are not guaranteed. Therefore, as a strong supporter of rural economic development. I believe that this project will benefit the economic welfare of citizens who live in this region. 
I recognize that some concerns still exist about the impacts of this project. I intend to work to improve the bill as it makes its way through the legislative process, and believe the concerns which some have raised regarding the environmental impacts of this project will be addressed as the project moves forward. Work on this important bill will likely be going on for some time, and I look forward to helping shape the final legislation and making the project a reality.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for their courtesy. 
Let me first of all start out by saying I associate myself with the remarks of Senator Sarbanes, the Senator from Maryland. Senator Sarbanes talked about equitable deficit reduction. I emphasize the equitable part of that formulation. 
Mr. President, those on both sides labored very hard. People make the decisions they think are the right decisions. I do not rise to point an accusatory finger at any of my colleagues. As I look at this agreement, I do not see that equitable deficit reduction. 
To give but one example, I see very little of the shared sacrifice, and I think to be shared sacrifice we would have to extend part of the deficit reduction burden onto large and wealthy corporations and zero in on what has been called corporate welfare. That means some of our large multinational corporations--oil and gas, mining, pharmaceutical, health care conglomerates, and others--who now reap benefits of huge loopholes in our Tax Code, who are fed, if you will, at the trough of unjustified tax giveaways, would, in fact, be required to pay their fair share toward deficit reduction. They are the heavy hitters, the well connected. They are the players. That is not a part of this budget agreement. I do not think what we have here is equitable deficit reduction. 
I know a number of my colleagues, as they look at some of these loopholes and deductions or as they make the case for across-the-board, what I call kind of a scatter-gun approach to cuts in capital gains or estate tax, make the argument this will bolster the economy by boosting savings and investments. 
I cite a report by the Republican staff of the House Budget Committee from just a few short years ago: 
Whether aimed at increasing efficiency or growth, many so-called `growth enhancements' backfire. This is due to two factors. First, few incentives are very powerful, and simply do not result in large increases in output. Second, they typically lose revenues, increasing government borrowing as a consequence, and thus reducing the accumulation of private capital as a result. 
My friends say to me, `But we are balancing the budget.' I smile and say, `We will see.' My guess is, as I look at those who are in control of the committees and especially are going to be dealing with the tax legislation, it looks to me like we go toward indexing capital gains. It looks to me that we will have across-the-board cuts in capital gains in estate not targeted to family business, not targeted to middle income, with the lion's share of benefits going to the very top of the American population. 
Mr. President, studies have shown consistently that households with incomes of over $100,000 a year receive approximately 75 percent of the capital gains income. If the goal is to provide relief to middle-income taxpayers, that is one thing, but what is happening here is the vast majority of the benefits go to those at the very top. 
At the same time, as we look at capital gains or estate tax, if you talk about family farmers or small businesses, fine. But I think that under the cover of the problems of small family farmers and small business people we are seeing in this budget agreement massive tax breaks to those who least need it. 
This estate tax goes to some of our families. Some of the families that will benefit are Cargo Co., a family-owned company, or Mars Candy or Continental Grain. I suggest to you that the multinational corporations hardly need more by way of more tax breaks. 
Mr. President, I think many Democrats are going to vote for this budget agreement but with far less enthusiasm than their public posture suggests. They are hoping when the reconciliation bill fills in the blanks on the budget and it comes to the floor this summer, we will not explode the deficits, and in addition, the critical investments in health care and education and children and all the rest that we believe in will, in fact, be there. 
As I look at the record of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle over the last couple of years, I have seen a defeat of efforts to go after corporate welfare. I have seen outrageous tax giveaways. I have seen a relentless attack on those in society least able to protect themselves, and I have seen very little standard of fairness when it comes to deficit reduction. I have seen deficit reduction based upon the path of least political resistance. Cut the benefits for those who are weakest --for children, for legal immigrants, for low- and moderate-income people, but when it comes to the subsidies for large oil companies or big insurance companies or some of the multinational corporations, big grain companies, no; they need more by way of benefits. 
I agree with my colleague from Maryland, I fear, and I think there is every reason to believe this based upon the pronouncements I have heard so far, that when we get to the tax part of this package we will see backloaded cuts, indexing, and cuts in capital gains and estate taxes that will explode the deficit as we move into the next millennium, at the very time, I 
might add, Mr. President, that many of us baby boomers come of age and we will have precious little by way of investment. 
Mr. President, I have several amendments that I will propose. I will start out joining with my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd. But I just want to highlight a few things I want to focus on. 
First let me talk a little bit about child nutrition. The School Breakfast Program, currently 6.5 million children participate. That is barely half of the children that are eligible. In the reform bill passed last year, all in the name of deficit reduction, we eliminated, wiped out grants for schools to start up the School Breakfast Program. 
Anybody who understands anything about education, anybody who understands anything about children, anybody who spends any time in schools will certainly acknowledge the fact that children who come to school hungry and cannot participate in school breakfast because we cut the funding for this program, are not going to be able to do as well in school as children who do not come to school hungry. 
Where is the standard of fairness? 
Mr. President, we also have a Summer Food Service Program, not real well known. As a matter of fact, only 2 million out of 14 million children participate because we do not adequately fund it. But do you want to know something, Mr. President? These children that really are so dependent upon school lunch and school breakfast, where it is available, during the summer they are malnourished and do not have an adequate diet. We are able to fund only 2 million out of 14 million children. Mr. President, in my amendment I will call for increasing the funding for this program. 
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about school construction. My friend Jonathan Kozol wrote a book called `Savage Inequalities.' He traveled all across the country and reported on what he observed. 
Mr. President, let me just make the point, I will not give specific examples, but let me say to my colleagues, we have too many children who go to rotting schools. What kind of message are we conveying to children in this country when they go to schools that are dilapidated, with rotting infrastructure, toilets that do not work, cold in the winter, too hot in the summer, crumbling buildings, decrepit? What kind of message are we conveying to these children? Are they not all God's children? Is there not some need for investment in infrastructure? 
The General Accounting Office reported in 1994, that over all, it would be about a $112 billion investment, and we want a $5 billion investment by way of a start as we move into the next century? 
Mr. President, have I not heard before speeches given, the talk about the importance of building a bridge to the next century? If we are not going to invest in rotting schools, if we are not going to invest in the infrastructure of the schools our children attend in this country, if we are not willing to invest a little bit more in child nutrition programs, if we are not willing to invest in some of what Senator Dodd's amendment, an amendment I want to join in and I know others will join, Head Start and Early Start, if we will not invest in children in these very critical early years of their lives, how can this budget agreement be a blueprint or a bridge for moving into the next century? 
My amendments will just simply say, take it out of corporate welfare and invest it in Head Start, child nutrition programs, and invest in the infrastructure of schools in America for our children. 
I have another amendment that will focus on some of the tax cuts that will say scale down the capital gains tax cut, scale down the estate tax cut, target it to middle-income people, target it to small business people, and target it to family farmers. Frankly, these large multinational corporations do not need it, nor do the top 1 or 2 percent of the population. Instead, invest in children. Invest in children. 
Mr. President, my final point, because I know we want to go on with the amendments, my final point, we have in the last several months been reading in Time magazine, in Newsweek magazine, there was a White House conference on the importance of early childhood development and the argument that is made is that the neuroscience evidence tells us if we do not do well for these children from the very beginning of their lives, if we to not do well with a mother expecting a child, in the very early years up to age 3, many of these children will never come to school ready to learn, and many of these children will never be prepared for life. 
One out of every four children in America under the age of 3 are poor. And one out of every two children of color in America under the age of 3 are poor. 
Mr. President, it is a scandal. It is unconscionable that we do not yet even fully fund the programs that we know work--Head Start, to give children a head start, nutrition programs so they do not come to school hungry, investment in infrastructure so the schools are inviting places as opposed to being decrepit 
and so demoralizing for children. 
Mr. President, my amendments will say invest in these areas and take it out of the subsidies of these large multinational corporations or scale back these tax giveaways that go mainly to the top 1, 2, or 3 percent of the population. 
To my colleagues, all of us have to make our own decisions, but for my own part, I think this is a budget without a soul. Quite frankly, I say to Democrats in particular, I think there comes a point in time where there are certain values and there are certain principles we hold dear. I think there comes a point in time when we cannot keep giving the speeches about the importance of children, the importance of education, the importance of equality of opportunity, the importance of each and every child having the same opportunity to reach his and her full potential. We cannot keep giving those speeches if we do not match the legislative lives that we live with the words that we speak. 
I will join with Senator Dodd in his amendment, and I will have other amendments on the floor, and I will raise this issue over and over and over again. I will raise this question over and over and over again. 
I do not believe this is a budget that calls for equitable deficit reduction. I do not believe this is a budget that is a bridge to the next century. I do not believe this is a budget that gives children in our country, every child--they are all God's children--the same opportunity to reach their full potential. 
I do not think this is a budget that invests in our future, because this budget, as opposed to being a new deal for too many children in America, is a raw deal for too many children in America, and that makes this budget unfair and that makes this budget wrong and that makes this budget not the best that we can do for children in America. Therefore, I will oppose this budget agreement. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from Oregon. I appreciate his remarks, but I want to point out that this amendment says that the offset comes from corporate welfare, as I understand it. Some we are looking at. The Joint Tax Committee and others have carefully studied hundreds of billions of dollars of tax loopholes that usually go to some of the largest corporations and some of the wealthiest individuals in the country. 
We are saying, can you not take a little bit from that, and instead, wouldn't you invest this in Head Start? And wouldn't you invest this in affordable child care? And wouldn't you invest this in Early Start? And wouldn't this make much more of a difference in children's lives? And wouldn't this better represent the standard of fairness of the people in the country? 
So, Madam President, this is not about breaking any deficit reduction plan. This is about whether or not this budget agreement reflects the priorities of people in this country.  
With all due respect to my colleagues, I think that if the choice for people in this country is between eliminating some of these egregious loopholes and deductions and instead investing more in children, and especially investing in this critical area of early childhood development, I say absolutely we ought to be doing that. 
Madam President, I would like to talk just a little bit about these programs and a little bit about the sort of overall context of this amendment. 
First of all, I have heard it so stated--and I say to my colleague from Oregon I will be willing to be critical of my own colleagues. I actually say this in a scrupulously, if you will, nonpartisan way. We talk about how we are expanding Head Start and, therefore, we are going to serve an additional 1 million children. But are we doing enough to reach the 2 million children who are not now participating? 
My colleague from Connecticut points out that in addition there is going to be some early Head Start funding, frankly, above and beyond the 1 million children who still are not receiving any assistance; that is, Head Start 3 to 5. 
If I was to include early Head Start, which is very consistent with very compelling scientific evidence that these are the really critical years, you know, right after birth, 1, 2, up to age 3, we are not coming even close to providing many children in this country with a head start. I far prefer to do that than to continue with a variety of different loopholes and deductions and breaks for some of the largest corporations in this country and wealthiest individuals who do not need it. 
I mean, I would be more than willing to lay out this proposition for people in the country over and over again and say, you know, whose side are you on? Cargo Continental Grain Co. or vulnerable children who are just looking for a break by way of Head Start to get them prepared for school or good child care or, as I was talking about earlier, though not in this amendment, adequate nutrition? That is what this is all about. That is what this amendment is all about. 
So the issue is not whether or not Senators are going to vote against this amendment because they are opposed to a budget agreement. I think my colleague from Connecticut and I may have different views on the overall budget agreement. I do not know yet. I guess he reserves final judgment. But you can be for the budget agreement and vote for this amendment because this amendment still keeps us within this path of a balanced budget. It just says: Couldn't we do a little bit better for children? 
I am aware of the fact that colleagues feel some time constraint, and I promise not to take more than a couple more minutes, but this is, I think, such an important amendment. I am proud to join in with the Senator from Connecticut and Senator Jeffords from Vermont and Senator Murray from Washington. 
Another way of looking at this for just a moment, with all due respect--and this is my hard-hitting point; I might have said it before on the floor of the Senate but it just feels right to say it at 10 to 6 on Tuesday evening--a real heroine to me--she is no longer alive--was a woman named Fannie Lou Hamer. She was a share cropper from Mississippi, an African-American woman. She once said, `I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.' She was a great civil rights leader. 
I just get a little sick and tired of everybody who says they are for children and investment in children and we are now going to build a bridge going to the next century and we are all for these children--except when it comes to investment. 
On the one hand, we say it is so important that children who come from really difficult circumstances get a head start. I mean, that is what we try to do. We do what the name of the program suggests, give these children a head start. And we talk about how unfair it is that so many children do not have this head start. And then we seem to be so comfortable with the fact that we still are not providing enough funding for 1 million children who are not 
going to receive it, ages 3 to 5, and God knows how many more children under the age of 3. 
Can't we do better? Can't we do better? Can't we have just a little bit less by way of tax breaks, loopholes, deductions, whatever you want to call it, for large multinational corporations? I mean, Lord, we are just talking about $15 billion out of studies that have talked about hundreds of billions of dollars. Can't we just provide them with a little less so we can provide a little more for these children? 
Second point. It will just be the last one, which is the child care piece. I believe my colleague from Connecticut, in this overall over 5 years, $15 billion, is saying we can do better. I think many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agrees with this. 
You look at the child care picture, and whether or not you want to talk about family-based child care or center-based child care or figure out ways you can have child care available for parent or parents at place of work, however you do it, however you do it, Madam President, it is just amazing, it is stunning how little we have done and how much we have to do. 
David Packard, who was Deputy Secretary of Defense under President Reagan, and his wife Lucile Packard have a foundation. They issued a report this past summer, and they talk about child care. They make the point, look, it is not just nutrition, it is not just health care, but in addition, if these children do not get the kind of nurturing and intellectual stimulation that affects the way the brain is wired, that affects whether or not they are going to have a chance. 
So many families--if we want to talk about working families, this is not just a poor people's issue. So many working families, so many of our children of parents in their thirties with two small children themselves, you look at their salaries, they cannot afford really good child care. 
What Senator Dodd is trying to do is at least expand some funding for good developmental child care. This is critical. This is the critical time. 
If the medical evidence is so compelling, if it is so irreducible, if it is irrefutable, and if we know we have to do this for children, why cannot we in this budget agreement take a little bit away from or have a little less by way of tax breaks, loopholes, deductions, you name it, for large multinational corporations and wealthy people at the top of the economic ladder in our country and instead do a little better by way of investment in children, so each and every child can finish this way, each and every child? 
I think we should be able to get good, strong bipartisan support. Each and every child in America, regardless of color of skin, regardless of income, regardless of religion, regardless of rural or urban, regardless of whether they be in Oregon or Connecticut or Maine or New Jersey or Minnesota, each and every child, regardless of religion, should have the same chance to reach her full potential, have a full chance to reach his full potential. 
That is the essence of the American dream. That is the goodness of our country. That is what we believe in. This amendment takes us just a little bit--but, boy, it really matters to many children in many families--takes us a little bit further in that wonderful direction. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was working in my office on some other matters, and it came to my attention that several of my colleagues, I think Senator Ashcroft and perhaps Senator McConnell of Kentucky, came down to speak about the comptime-flextime bill that Senator Ashcroft introduced, S. 4. I want to respond to some of what they had to say because I think it is important that people in the country understand this debate and how it affects their lives. 
Mr. President, one of the arguments that was made was that Democrats--it was a curious argument--by coming out on the floor, and I was one that did so, and Senator Kennedy was out here and there were others, that by speaking in opposition to S. 4, we did not want to debate. The legislation was stopped. There were not enough votes to proceed. So somehow we did not want to debate the bill. 
Mr. President, we should be clear about the difference between trying to get some legislation passed that will lead to an improvement in the quality of lives of people, as opposed to bringing out legislation which you know will never become law. 
At the top of the issues I care most about is campaign finance reform. I keep being told we do not have time to do it on the floor of the Senate. We have core issues to debate. Mr. President, I disagree sharply with my colleagues. I make the point that when you bring a bill to the floor of the Senate which the President has already said he would veto, when you bring a bill to the floor of the Senate, S. 4 in the form it was brought to the floor, knowing full well that you will have a significant number of Senators, certainly well over 40, in opposition, this is hardly the way to pass legislation. You can score political points. You can come to the floor today and try and score political points, but that is not a substitute for a substantive argument and debate. 
Now, Mr. President, we should be clear about what we oppose because I do not think it is a question of what I oppose, as the Senator from Minnesota. I think it is a question of how people in the country may view this.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from North Dakota is absolutely correct. That is why I said earlier that I would want to point to the critical distinction between coming out here on the floor with a piece of legislation that you know threatens the labor standards of working people, that you know doesn't provide the flexibility, that you know is not going to get the votes to pass, that you know the President is going to veto, and doing what should be done, if, in fact, we care about working people and children, which is to come out with a piece of legislation that really does provide the comptime, the flexibility, without threatening people who really rely on that overtime pay.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. It takes the Fair Labor Standards Act, which, as I said the other day, is based on a lot of sweat and tears of a lot of working families, and turns the whole idea of fairness on its head. That is absolutely right. 
That is why that piece of legislation went nowhere on the floor of the Senate, nor should it. 
That is absolutely correct.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I would say to my colleague that he is correct. I think the key issues are, when you have proposals in here, first, what you do, if you are serious about passing a piece of legislation that is going to help working families, is you take the extreme and harsh parts out, like overturning the 40-hour week. 
Second of all, you make sure you don't have a lot of coercion at the workplace, and that employees really do have a choice, whether it be a woman or a man. And, if so, they get either that at time-and-a-half pay or they get that time-and-a-half off when they want and need to take it. 
If you can make sure that happens, if you make sure that you have the important provisions to make sure that happens, and if you make sure there isn't exploitation, then it is absolutely the right direction to go. 
That would be, I hope, the common ground. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators on the floor. We are undoubtedly going to be back on this bill with plenty of opportunity for amendments and work on it, so I am going to try to be very brief in deference to a number of colleagues. I know my colleague from Texas has to leave very soon, and I see a colleague from Maine here. 
My disappointment is that the version of S. 4 that we see right now on the floor is a harsh version. It is not going to pass. It is going to go nowhere. 
I would really like to see us do some work together. We had several subcommittee hearings that I thought were productive. I thank my colleague, Senator DeWine from Ohio, for his leadership. We had a respectful markup. There was discussion in the markup, where amendments were voted down on a straight party vote, in which some of our colleagues appeared interested in modifications and ways of making this a better bill, changes that could bring people together--fixing the bill. That just has not happened. I know there is a managers' amendment. But a lot of concerns that have been raised just have not been spoken to. 
The House bill, remember, passed narrowly. That bill was a much more moderate version than this Senate bill. It did not have the 80-hour biweekly work period framework. It did not have the so-called flextime. It was a straight comptime bill. In my view, anything that essentially takes the Fair Labor Standards Act and turns it on its head is not going to go anywhere. That is what the 80-hour framework does. And flextime, which offers little to the employee, does the same thing. I don't believe that anything that is hour for hour as opposed to time and a half is going to go anywhere either. 
So I find it surprising and discouraging that we are discussing this particular version of this bill. It is not going to be enacted into law. I really wonder why we are debating it in its present form. 
I believe there is some work we can do on the bill. Maybe we can do it through amendments and come out of here with a piece of legislation that we can all get behind. But whatever the bill's press materials promise about it, the fact of the matter is that in its current form the bill turns the clock back half a century. It is simply not going to work. My colleague, for example, came to the floor and was angry about ads that have been run. This is the first time I heard what those ads have to say. But reading from the script of one of the ads, a portion of the voiceover says: 
Big business is moving to gut a law protecting our right to overtime pay. If they win, employers could pay workers with time off instead of money. 
That is true. That is absolutely true. 
In theory, you could say employees have a right to choose. But the reality of the pattern of power between employees and employers is that quite often employees do not have that power to choose. 
Then the ad says: 
They say the choice will be up to us. But there are no real safeguards to keep employers from pressuring workers to accept time off, or telling them when to take it. 
That also is true. I pointed out in subcommittee and in committee examples of ways in which overtime law is being violated right now. There is a backlog of complaints at the Department of Labor. Regardless of the theory of the bill, it could very well happen that coercion will take place. 
Finally, and I know my colleague from Missouri, whom I enjoy as a friend, was very worked up about this portion:  
You could work up to 40 additional hours a week before qualifying for overtime pay. 
That provision is not in the House version of comptime. But in theory, that is true of this Senate version. I don't think it would happen, but the fact of the matter is, when you go from a 40-hour week to an 80-hour biweekly timeframe, that is exactly what 
could happen. Somebody could work 80 hours one week and not work the next week at all, but for the 80 hours they worked for that first week, there would be no overtime pay for the hours worked over 40 hours. That could happen. That is true. I don't think it would happen. But there is a real danger here, if you don't limit the bill to comptime, of employers being in a situation--and they really do have the power most of the time--where they basically can say to employees: We are interested in the flextime option. We are interested in your working overtime 1 week and taking more time off the next week. But we are not interested in time and a half, premium compensation, which you would earn with comptime. 
Employers are in the driver's seat. The real problem is that the bill does not provide the flexibility that it purports to provide. That is a huge problem. 
There are two principles, and I am skipping over a lot of what I wanted to say. There are two basic principles at a minimum, I say to my colleague from Missouri, that will be required to make comptime work for employees and give them real flexibility. These should be the basis for the work we do together. 
First, it has to be truly voluntary. There has to be some language that puts more teeth into the voluntariness. Frankly, there is not right now. 
Second, employees must really get to use their accumulated comptime when they want and need to use it. That was the why of one of the amendments I introduced, which said we have the Family and Medical Leave Act. FMLA makes clear in which cases we let families take some time off, even though millions of people are not covered right now. In any case, this bill would be an opportunity to say to somebody with banked comptime: It's your time. You have earned it. If you have that time and now you need to take time off because you need to go to a PTA meeting or have an illnes in the family, or for that matter you are having problems at home and have been battered, where there are problems of domestic abuse and you need to take time off, you should be able to take that time off. There should not be any question about it. You have earned it as compensation for hours worked. It should not be up to the employer to decide whether you can use it if FMLA reasons exist. 
So I just want to make it clear that at the moment I do not see this as a Family Friendly Workplace Act. I do not see it as a Mother's Day present. It is not truly voluntary. We cannot change a piece of legislation that people have given their sweat, blood and tears for, which is what we are talking about when we talk about the Fair Labor Standards Act, unless you keep the integrity of it. We are not doing that here. 
So there are some huge problems. The bill is not truly voluntary, No. 1. It moves away from a 40-hour week. It sets up a 2-week, 80-hour framework. That is not in the House bill. I think that has to be out of the bill. It has a flextime option which is just hour for hour. In my view, if we want to get something passed here, we should be making it comptime and we should then say to people, look, we want to give you real choice and the flexibility of using that time when you want and need to use it. 
But I say to my colleagues that at this point in time, I don't know what the majority leader's intentions were, but I think it is fine to debate, it is fine to talk. It is not pointless, but this legislation is not going anywhere, not in its present form. 
I believe Senator DeWine is very committed to working out a compromise, and I believe my colleague from Missouri is also committed to a compromise. Maybe the strategy is to stake out an extreme position, with the idea that it helps for negotiating purposes. I don't mean to incur my colleagues' wrath--but I say to them, this is not a Mother's Day present, not in its present form. It is not a Family Friendly Workplace Act, not in its present form. However you package it, and however you try to market it, and however you try to advertise it, the fact of the matter is, you don't have the flexibility for the employee; you take the Fair Labor Standards Act and you turn it on its head. You go to an 80-hour framework and you should not. Then on comptime, you don't really make sure employees truly will have the choice, which is what I thought it was about. 
We had some amendments that lost on a straight party-line vote. So let's get rid of the extreme provisions of this legislation, let's talk about the comptime part. Let's talk about how a family, a woman or a man can have this choice between time and a half for overtime pay or time-and-a-half overtime for time needed to be with family. Let's make sure that employees have the flexibility to truly be able to make this choice, that it is not one sided and just for employers. Let's make sure that we really establish a kind of cooperative arrangement. But that is not what this bill does. 
I say with some disappointment to a good friend, I oppose it. I think that we will have a strong vote against it. I have to say, it is one of these situations--I promise my colleague from Texas, I will be done in 1 minute now, I know she wants to speak--but really Florence Reese wrote the song, `Which Side Are You On?' I heard my colleague from Missouri cite that lyric. I know it by heart because my wife is from Harlan County, KY. It is a great song. It was written during all the coal mining strikes. Of course, you know it's a strong union song. 
The fact of the matter is, when I look at the lineup of who is opposed to this bill, and I see all these unions and all these organizations that have fought for civil rights and human rights and for women over the years, I guess I do know who's side I am on. I am on the side of working people. 
This piece of legislation could be for working people, but in its present form, it is going nowhere. There are going to be Senators, and I certainly count myself as one of them, who will oppose this with everything we have, and I think we can stop it. I hope we get to the point of having some amendments, figuring out ways we can come together and pass a piece of legislation, but not in this form. I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is somewhat surprising, and not very encouraging, that we are considering such a harsh version of S. 4 today. The bill before us is essentially the version which was reported out of the Labor Committee on a straight party-line vote. That vote followed rejection by a majority on the committee of a number of amendments which would have improved the bill considerably. All those amendments were defeated on a straight party-line vote. 
This version of S. 4 makes almost no changes which directly address the serious and substantive problems in the bill during committee consideration. The managers' amendment has just been made available this morning, so we have not been able to examine it in detail. But it does not appear to be much of an effort to make the bill more acceptable to those who have made a real effort to improve the bill so far. 
It is surprising and discouraging that we are considering this particular version of S. 4 for two reasons. 
First, many of our colleagues are aware that a comptime bill has passed the House of Representatives. That bill is considerably milder than this bill in its undermining of basic, long-respected labor protections. The House-passed bill does not directly undercut the 40-hour workweek. It does not give employers the option of offering only hour-for-hour compensatory time off in exchange for overtime work--so-called flextime. 
Still, the House bill passed narrowly, and it passed under the threat of a likely veto by the President. The President has said he would like to sign a comptime bill. But the Department of Labor has signaled that the President would likely veto a bill like the House bill. In my opinion, a veto of the House-passed bill would clearly be warranted because that bill does not meet the standards of anyone who is serious about trying to help employees cope with the competing demands of work and families. 
The House has narrowly passed a bill which likely would, and certainly should, be vetoed. So what is the Senate doing today? Here in the Senate we are considering a bill that is a far blunter and a far more dangerous attack on workers with families, a bill which we all know cannot be enacted in its present form. We know an 80-hour biweekly work period will not become law. Why are we debating it? Do we think the public is fooled by a bill which does away with the 40-hour workweek simply because the measure's proponents say it is voluntary? 
It is somewhat absurd. If a Member came and offered a bill doing away with the minimum wage--but on a voluntary basis--we would not take it seriously. If a bill offered employees the voluntary choice of working regularly in conditions which threaten life and limb, we would not take it seriously. A bill doing away with the 40-hour workweek cannot be enacted as drafted, and it should not even be taking our time here today. 
The second reason I find it surprising and discouraging that we are discussing this particular version of comptime is that I sat through two hearings on this topic in the Labor Subcommittee on Employment and Training, where I serve as ranking minority member. I heard a great deal of illuminating testimony during the subcommittee hearings. I also engaged, as did others in the Labor Committee, in a respectably rigorous markup of this bill in the full committee. 
During these subcommittee and committee meetings we heard a number of expressions of sympathy and concern from Republican colleagues regarding criticisms of S. 4 raised by myself and others. These expressions of concern might have been slightly more persuasive if even one Republican could have found a way to vote for even one Democratic amendment in the committee. Nonetheless, I thought I detected a desire to make this a workable bill. There were suggestions that ways might be found to fix problems in the bill. 
Some of us thought that there would be an effort to address the more serious of our concerns between committee and the floor. But the minor changes in the managers' amendment, with one exception do not begin to do that. I will come back to the managers' amendment and our detailed criticisms of this bill's comptime provisions later. 
But what we have before us today is hardly an effort at accommodation. The bill in its current form is little more than an affront. Not only have the most offensive provisions for employees--the 80-hour biweekly work period and so-called flextime--not been pulled from the bill. But the comptime provisions which could be the basis of discussion and agreement remain largely unchanged. 
Mr. President, many of us on the minority side would like nothing better than to help provide genuine flexibility to working Americans with families. That is what this bill's press materials promise it would do. That is what some of us set out to do 4 years ago when we pushed hard to win eventual passage of the Family Medical Leave Act. Some of today's proponents of S. 4 issued dire warnings back then that the FMLA would harm businesses and the economy. It hasn't. The FMLA has worked well. 
That is why our side offered two amendments to S. 4 in committee which would have expanded the FMLA. Millions of workers do not currently enjoy the benefits of the FMLA. Millions who do are able to use it only for medical reasons, not for other times of true family need and importance, such as parent-teacher conferences. This bill purports to provide greater flexibility to employees, so we sought to expand the ability to take unpaid leave in exceptional family circumstances. Unfortunately, both amendments to that effect were defeated. 
Many of us on the minority side also would like nothing better than to allow working Americans with families to get more control over their work schedules. What could be more important than to help people juggle work and family by getting more control over their work schedules? 
That was the motivation behind an amendment I offered in committee which would have ensured that employees who accumulate comptime as envisioned by this bill would actually get to use it when they want and need to use it. That seemed simple enough. 
If the idea of the bill is to help employees get control of their work schedules, if the idea is to be family friendly, then people who accumulate comptime under this bill, which is compensation that has already been earned at some prior date, not vacation or some other benefit conferred by the employer, but previously earned compensation, should be able to use it when they want and need to use it. 
My amendment included very reasonable restrictions to avoid harm to employers. It was an honest amendment. It sought to take this bill at its word. At least it sought to take the bill at the word of its own 
advertising. It sought to provide employees who have families just a little more control over their work schedules by allowing them to choose when it is that they use their earned comptime. 
In the case of this bill, however, its advertising and its content are not the same thing at all. Undoubtedly, many workers who may have heard this bill described by it proponents, who may even have heard it described as a Mother's Day gift to working mothers, probably have assumed that if the bill passes and they earn comptime, then they will be able, within reason, to choose when to use that comptime. Sadly, they would be wrong. This bill does not provide for that. My amendment sought to repair this fairly obvious, fairly egregious flaw. But it was defeated. 
Many of us on the minority side even find the idea of a truly voluntary choice between cash overtime on one hand, and paid time off at a premium rate on the other--in other words, between cash overtime and comptime--to be an attractive idea on its face. We think comptime might be able to work to the benefit of both employers and employees if it is drafted properly. 
Therefore, in the committee we offered a number of additional amendments whose purpose was to take seriously the idea that comptime is indeed meant to deliver on what the title of S. 4 promises. The bill is called the Family Friendly Workplace Act. All those amendments were defeated. 
Comptime will not be an easy idea to make work in a way that is truly voluntary. A lot of care must go into drafting such a bill. It is worth remembering that the Fair Labor Standards Act has served both employers and employees well since its initial passage in 1938. We should amend it with care. Nonetheless, the whole law is not sacred. Democrats and working people are not stuck in the past. If we can move forward, and not turn back the clock, it might be possible and desirable to change the Fair Labor Standards Act. But not in the way this bill suggests--not in a way that attempts to turn back the clock when it comes to basic workplace protections. 
After the two hearings we held in the Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Employment and Training, I was frankly skeptical about whether comptime could be made truly voluntary and beneficial for employees. It was the testimony of some of the majority witnesses which made me even more skeptical than I was before the hearings. Looking at the version of the bill which has now been brought to the floor, my skepticism appears to have been justified. But still I think comptime could be attractive for many working people if it is drafted properly. 
There are two basic principles which at a minimum are required to make comptime attractive for employees: First, it must be truly voluntary; second, employees must really get to use their accumulated comptime when they want and need to use it. 
A number of additional protections would be necessary as details to make comptime work. But these two principles are fundamental. 
As currently drafted, S. 4 fails both tests. It has additional problems, but above all S. 4 as drafted barely even pretends to be about providing flexibility for working people. It is flexibility for employers. It is flexibility for employers, combined with ways to cut pay for employees. It disfigures what could be a decent idea, comptime, and it adds provisions that even leaders in the House of Representatives did not attempt, which would directly cut workers' pay. 
Mr. President, we all understand the game of staking out an extreme position in the hope that you can get more of what you want through creating the illusion of compromise from a drastic proposal. I hope we will not spend our time on that game. But it appears that is the game we are playing with this bill. 
Let us just drop the 80-hour biweekly work period from the bill. It is not a real proposal. It is an insult to working people with families. Many workers face enough indignities without Congress adding to them. Let us drop this frontal attack on the principle of the 40-hour work week. 
Second, let us drop the flex hours provision from this bill. That is the provision which would ask workers to work overtime with no premium compensation, only hour-for-hour paid time off. 
These are provisions which not even the House of Representatives included in their bill. No one can argue with a straight face that these are not pay-cut provisions. Their purpose is to cut pay. The President will not sign a bill with such provisions. The 80-hour and the flextime provisions simply detract and distract from the debate we should have about comptime. 
Mr. President, I would like to conclude with some remarks about working families.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the Chinese Government that the Chinese Government immediately release Wei Jingsheng, an extraordinary man who tells truth to power, authoritarian and arbitrary power. I meant to bring his book to the floor. It is being released today, May 13. 
Mr. President, the publication date of this book is today. The title of the book is `Courage To Stand Alone.' I have very limited time, but I just want to say on the floor of the Senate, because I really believe there ought to be a focus on Wei Jingsheng, that this is a man of tremendous courage. I have had a chance to skim-read the book. I am going to read it word for word. 
I know that Wei Jingsheng was in prison from 1979, I believe, until 1993. Then he was released, and then again he spoke out, as anyone should do, about the importance of freedom and democracy, and again he finds himself in prison. 
Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will all help me in calling for his release. I know Senator Helms has signed this letter. So has Senator Kennedy. I am very pleased to work with both of those Senators, and, in addition, Senator Moynihan has signed this letter as well. We are going to add more and more signatures. We are talking about a man who is in very poor health. I just want to quote from Wei's outline of `My Defense' which was delivered at his trial on December 13, 1995. 
To sum up, the basic error of the indictment . . . is that it confounds the actions of defending human rights and promoting democracy and reform with `conspiracy to subvert the government.' Therefore, anything that can be linked to the `Democracy Movement' or `human rights' is an act of conspiracy and subversion. . . . A government that can be subverted by a movement of human rights and democracy can only be a government with a contradictory and opposite nature, a government that does not respect human rights or promote democracy, a government of `feudal, fascist dictatorship.' . . . According to our Constitution and laws, the people are the owner of this nation and the government is merely an agent of the people. The government must respect the sovereignty of the people, namely the individual freedoms and political rights of each citizen, including the right of people to know, the right to criticize and supervise the government, even to replace the government. If the government abolishes or suppresses such democratic rights, then it becomes an illegal government and loses its legitimacy, which is based on the Chinese Constitution. Therefore, if the general charges brought by the indictment against the human and democracy movement are valid, then the government it represents is not the legal Chinese Government and the charges it brings are illegal. 
Mr. President, these are words that might have been uttered by Thomas Jefferson. I again want to just rise in the Senate today and call on all of my colleagues to stand up for Wei Jingsheng, this extraordinary man. He has now been sentenced to 14 years in prison under austere conditions that threaten his life. Today is the publication of the book, `Courage To Stand Alone.' This is a collection of Wei's letters to Chinese leaders, prison officials, and to his family. 
He is a remarkable man, as I have said before. This is an extremely important work. He is eloquent. If you think about the conditions under which he has written these letters, it makes this all the more remarkable. 
It is not only urgent that the Chinese Government release Wei, but also that it provide him with the medical care that he desperately needs but has been denied. He has a heart disease that threatens his life, severe hypertension, and a serious back ailment that renders him unable to hold his head erect. The Chinese Government ought to release this courageous man. He is a prisoner of conscience. 
Today is the publication of a remarkable book, `Courage to Stand Alone.' Wei Jingsheng is a man who represents the very best of the tradition of our country. He is a man who has spoken up for human rights and democracy and has paid a terrible price for it. I believe it is important for all of us, regardless of political party, all of us in our country to speak up for prisoners of conscience. In this particular case, I take the Senate floor to call on the Chinese Government to release Wei Jingsheng from prison, to release him from prison today and to provide him with the medical care that he needs. 
Mr. President, again, I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort. I hope my colleagues will have a chance to read this remarkable work, `Courage To Stand Alone.' I hope it becomes a best seller in the United States of America. 
In the 30 seconds I have left, let me just say, personally I do not know how people find the courage. If I lived in such a country and I thought that by speaking up I could wind up in prison, or even worse, that my children could be rounded up and that they could end up being tortured or they could end up being in prison, which so often happens in these countries headed by repressive governments, I do not think I could find the courage to speak up. 
I think it is time all of us in the U.S. Congress speak up for men and women like Wei Jingsheng who have had the courage to stand alone. I think it is extremely important that we do everything we can to call on the Chinese Government and to make it crystal clear to the Chinese Government that they ought to release this courageous man from prison, and other prisoners of conscience as well. If they do not do that, then I think all of us ought to look at trade relations and other relations with China and other countries that violate the basic human rights of their citizens. We need to exert leadership and we need to make a difference. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, at a time when communities are demanding that schools provide quality education; at a time when many schools talk of scarce resources; at a time when parents ask that their children's schools be safe and orderly places to learn--it is easier sometimes to find a scapegoat than to address the real problems. I am greatly concerned that the scapegoat has become children with disabilities. Even though they have only had the right to an education for 22 years--I have heard over and over again that it is those children who gobble up scarce resources and who prevent other children from receiving a decent education. 
But I have heard from parents whose children have disabilities, I have met these children. They just want to learn. And the civil rights statute that we passed 22 years ago says that to not educate them is to illegally discriminate against them. But still, these students and parents are afraid that schools will retreat to segregation and separate schooling. We must listen to these voices of pleading and concern. 
There are 100,000 children in Minnesota that are protected by this statute, and up to 200,000 parents. IDEA strives to keep these students in school in as normal an environment as possible because integration gives them the chance they deserve. What a noble goal. What achievements we have seen over the years since the law was written. The first generation of IDEA educated children are just now coming into their own in this country and I believe that we all benefit immeasurably from their developed talents and abilities. While there have been problems with IDEA, it is my belief that the problems stem not from the law itself, but from the enforcement and implementation of this law. 
I know the bill we have before us represents a delicate compromise--and that any successful amendment has the potential to make the deal crumble. I have not come to the floor this morning seeking to change this bill. But I cannot vote for this bill without pointing out the trouble spots I see. The disability community has not had much time to fully analyze this bill. This is a fact that I mentioned in my letter last Monday to Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, while asking them to postpone this markup. 
A quick review of this bill shows that, at least among parents and students, the discipline section has raised the most red flags. There is a concern that a manifestation determination review will be a very difficult process for parents, particularly low-income parents who may not have access to psychologists and other professionals. Advocates are particularly worried about the courts being replaced by an administrative 
hearing officer because they may be appointed by an LEA, there are different rules of evidence and there is no assurance that they will be attorneys or appropriately qualified. Another concern raised by parents is how substantially likely to result in injury to self or others will be interpreted. Children with autism, Tourette's syndrome, ADHD or ADD and severe emotional disturbances are especially at risk. 
And last we need to ask where children will be placed--what alternative placements are available? If the primary alternative is home-bound placement we will see families facing incredible stress and financial hardships. If the primary alternative is a segregated setting we run the risk of returning to a system that offered minimal education to children in isolated, warehouse-like settings. 
That said, I would like to congratulate the leadership team that assembled this bill in marathon sessions for the last 8 weeks. On February 20, 1997 a bipartisan, bicameral working group was established to develop a compromise bill. This working group included a representative from the Department of Education--Judy Heumann, Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services--and the following offices: Harkin, Kennedy, Dodd, Jeffords, Coats, Frist, Martinez, Scott, Miller, Goodling, Riggs, and Castle. The facilitator of the group was David Hoppe, the majority leader's chief of staff. A member of my staff was intimately involved in this process, and by his and all accounts this was an impressive display of bipartisan negotiation. 
The first work product of the group was a statement of principles. The major goal of the working group was to review, strengthen, and improve IDEA to better educate children with disabilities, and enable them to receive a quality education. With this goal in mind, the working group agreed to start with current law and build on the actions, experiences, information, and research gathered over the life of the law, particularly over the past 3 years. The group met for 7 weeks, often for 12 hours a day, to reach an agreement that all could support. 
I believe that the bill improves current law in several ways. The bill includes significant increases for the IDEA preschool program and significant increases for the early intervention program under part H. 
The final agreement significantly improves and strengthens the Individualized Education Plan [IEP] by, among other things, relating a child's education to what children without disabilities are receiving and providing report cards just like nondisabled students receive. Of 
great concern to my home State of Minnesota, the bill retains short-term objectives which are planned goals in the education of children with disabilities that parents consider a crucial device for ensuring success and accountability. The bill also specifies that regular teachers will be part of the IEP team, where appropriate, and the report language encourages the participation of school health professionals where appropriate. 
The new bill requires parents to be included in the group making placement decisions about their child, as opposed to current law, which in some States allows another group other than the IEP team to make placement decisions. 
The new bill ensures that States and local school districts include children with disabilities in their performance goals, indicators, and general assessments. The bill ensures parental consent for triennial reevaluations--not just initial evaluations as under current law--and ensures that evaluations are relevant to the child's instructional needs. 
The bill includes improvements in the early intervention program, including clarification that infants and toddlers should receive services in natural environments, such as their homes, where appropriate. 
IDEA funding will now cover support services related to a student's disability. For example, the final agreement now lists orientation and mobility services for vision-impaired children as a related service--currently required by interpretation--and includes report language clarifying that children with disabilities should receive travel training--including how to use public transportation where it is deemed appropriate as part of their IEP. 
The bill requires States to monitor school districts to determine whether they are disproportionately segregating minority children in certain placements and to determine whether there is a disproportionate number of long-term suspensions and expulsions of children with disabilities. 
The bill gives the Secretary and State educational agencies [SEA's] greater power to implement the law by providing authority to withhold all or some funds when schools violate IDEA. Currently, the Secretary is required to withhold all funds if there is a violation; this punishment was viewed as too strict and never applied. 
The bill contains provisions to ensure that increases in Federal appropriations are not offset by State decreases in spending. The State maintenance of effort provisions give reasonable authority to the Secretary of 
Education to establish criteria for exceptions if necessary. 
The bill codifies local maintenance of effort provisions from regulations and includes reasonable additional exemptions for when a locality need not maintain financial efforts for special education--for example when a teacher at the high end of the pay scale retires and is replaced by a recent graduate. 
The bill reduces paperwork. State and local applications need be submitted only once and thereafter they need to submit only amendments necessitated by compliance problems or changes in the law. 
Importantly, when it comes to discipline, the bill provides for no cessation of services for IDEA students, no separate IDEA provision on the treatment of disruptive children, and no unilateral authority to determine who is dangerous and remove them. 
These improvements in the IDEA law do make a difference and I'm pleased that they were adopted. But the drawbacks I mentioned earlier hamper my enthusiasm for the bill. While I will vote for the bill today, I have chosen not to cosponsor this bill. I hope that Members will continue to listen to the voices of parents, who are faced with the daily task of raising and educating their children. They know firsthand how IDEA is implemented at the local level and thus we must listen to--and address--the concerns that they raise. Let us all remember who this bill is for, and strive to make it work for them.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I was listening to my colleague from Wisconsin, and I thank him for leading this reform effort, in fact I thank Senator McCain and other Senators as well. I know the Presiding Officer has done a lot of work and has spoken out about trying to really reduce the role of big money in politics. 
The question I ask my colleague has to do with this whole issue of incumbents and challengers. It has been said sometimes that the debate about campaign finance reform is really less a debate between Democrats and Republicans and all too often is more a debate between ins and outs; that, if anything, part of the inertia here and the slowness to embrace reform and the fierce opposition has to do with the fact that right now the system is really wild for those people who are in office. 
My question for my colleague is does he feel some sense of urgency and will he consider coming to the floor every week now with other colleagues--the two of us are sort of getting started. There are a number of Senators who feel very strongly that this is a core issue, the influence of money in politics, and the most important thing we could ever do would be to pass a significant reform measure. Is my colleague from Wisconsin beginning to feel as though it is really going to be important that every week from now on for Democrats and Republicans who are serious about reform to be out on the floor and beginning to frame the issues, especially focusing on what are going to be the solutions?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if my colleague will allow me to share a concern with him and get his response. Let me tell you what my worry is. I do not have any doubt that people in the country know that too much money is spent, that they know there is too much special interest access, that they know all of us spend too much time raising money. I have no doubt that people understand that. As a matter of fact, I think one of the things that is making it more and more difficult for people to get involved at the grassroots level is when they see these huge amounts of money contributed by some folks and some interests and then they get a letter: We would like you to make a $10 contribution and be involved in our grassroots effort. 
They are a little cynical, and they figure: Come on, give us a break; we know the people who are most involved in this process. It is not us and our family. 
This is the core issue for a representative democracy. But my concern is that the Rules Committee starts next week, and there will be an effort, as I have at least looked at a preliminary list of witnesses--not to talk about any particular witness--there is going to be a pretty strong effort on the part of the Rules Committee, which I have called in the Chamber of the Senate, a merry-go-round for reform, to basically frame this issue and the issue will be not enough money is spent; all we need is disclosure so that we can make people realize how bad it is, without doing anything to make it better. As I look at the ways in which the Rules Committee moves forward starting next week, I see the beginning of the debate. I see the beginning of the debate. 
So I say to my colleague, will he agree with me that it is going to be important for those of us who are committed to reform, Democrats and Republicans--and there is a pretty significant group--to start coming out on the floor? We will figure out the vehicles, and it is not necessarily amendments, but there are always ways of speaking. Should we not now every week be out here framing this issue and over and over again saying what are going to be the solutions to these problems and are we or are we not going to take action in this Congress?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if my colleague will just yield for one other question, another concern, and then I will leave the floor and let him conclude. I wonder whether the Senator from Wisconsin would agree with me that--I mean, in, oh, so many ways--what we see happening in the country is every election year we see cited the figures: People spend more and more money in the campaigns and fewer and fewer people participate. People are really losing heart. 
I have said before that I do not see it as corruption as in the wrongdoing of individual officeholders. But I see systemic corruption, where these campaigns have become TV-intensive, relying on huge amounts of money and, therefore, you have this huge imbalance of influence and power where too few people give way too much of the money that is given, and are given access and influence, and too many people are left out of the loop. This becomes a real problem for a representative democracy because it is not true any longer that each person counts as one and only one. 
So I ask my colleague whether he would agree that it is going to be important, not just for us to speak 20 minutes a day, but now for us to begin to get together? I ask him whether, as a leader in this effort--and he has been a leader of this effort --whether we might really be reaching out to other colleagues who feel very strongly about this, who really want people in our country to believe in the political process--all of us should want to change this--and get some people together and come out on the floor of the Senate? We are going to keep framing this issue and we are going to keep calling for reform and we are going to make it crystal clear that we are not going to let the Senate, or the Congress, become a politics of diversion on this. 
It is fine to identify problems. If some people want to say we do not have disclosure, fine. If some people want to say it is influence of foreign money, fine. If some people want to say it is just the rules that have been broken and no more than that, fine. But the people in the country know too much money is spent, there is too much special access, there is too much time spent raising money, and we have to build the McCain-Feingold bill that is out there. We want to move that forward and we want to eventually have an up-or-down vote. 
Does my colleague agree that we need to start turning up the heat?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in the 5 minutes--and I thank my colleague from Alaska. 
Mr. President, I have spoken about the budget agreement on the floor of the Senate several times. I have said I very honestly and truthfully believe it is an agreement without a soul. I have compared the tax cuts over the next 10 and 20 years as we project to the future, and who is likely to benefit--those at the very top--alongside the failure to invest in rotting schools, invest in early childhood development; alongside some of the cuts in programs that affect the most vulnerable citizens. And I do not see the standard of fairness. I do not see the soul to this budget. I think we can do much better. I have challenged my colleagues to please avoid symbolic politics and, if we are going to talk about children and opportunities for children, let us make the investment. 
Now, we have in this continuing resolution, which I am sure has been offered in good faith, a couple of problems. First of all, many of us--all of us from the States that have been affected by this flooding with people who have just felt the devastation--have made the plea, please do not attach extraneous amendments. If we have to deal with the problem of Government shutdown--and there is not one person in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives who is going to let that happen. I think people learned their lesson--we can deal with that in the fall, if it ever should be a problem that is staring us in the face. I do not think that will ever happen. But why such an amendment would be put on a disaster relief bill where what we are trying to do is get the assistance to people as soon as possible so they can rebuild their lives, rebuild their homes, rebuild their businesses--I don't understand this. I think it is a profound mistake, and I do not believe this amendment should be on this bill at all. 
In addition, when I look at the budget agreement--and I do not think we have done it nearly as well as we should for people --and now I see additional, I won't even go through the statistics, additional cuts from what the budget agreement calls for in Head Start, in research at the National Institutes of Health, over and over again I am faced with the painful choice, and other colleagues are as well, of meeting with people struggling with Alzheimer's or struggling with Parkinson's or struggling with breast cancer or struggling with diabetes, and we do not want one group of people who are struggling with an illness pitted against another, or struggling with mental illness --what in the world are we doing with a resolution that is going to cut funding for the National Institutes of Health? 
Mr. President, Meals on Wheels, a senior nutrition program --cut? Substance abuse and mental health services--cut? The Centers for Disease Control--cut? Pell Grant 
Program--cut, when we know the whole question of affordable higher education is an issue that cuts across a broad section of the population? 
So, in the 5 minutes I have, I make two points. One, please vote against this, I say to my colleagues, because it is extraneous to what the mission is, which is to get the assistance to people in Minnesota, the Dakotas, and across the land who have been faced with a real disaster in their lives. And, second, do not vote for this amendment because we are talking about real cuts in programs that are vitally important to families' lives in this country. And people in the country do not favor these priorities. People do not want to see reductions in Head Start, in Pell grants, in the National Institutes of Health research on disease. People are not in favor of that. 
This is, in a way, a back-door approach to trying to effect cuts in programs that command widespread support in this country. So, I rise to speak against it. I hope we will have a strong vote against this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 672, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The President has now declared a major disaster for over 50 counties in the State of Minnesota, and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in areas hard hit by severe flooding, severe winter storms, snow melt, high winds, rain, and ice. This disaster assistance is urgently needed in my State and I want to thank Senators Stevens and Byrd for their work in getting this package through the Senate. 
While I intend to vote for this bill, I am very concerned about the ramifications of the McCain amendment, which triggers an automatic continuing resolution for fiscal year 1998 if Congress fails to pass appropriations bills. This disaster bill provides important assistance to Minnesotans struggling to rebuild their lives following an unprecedented natural disaster, and I think it is outrageous that we have used the emergency supplemental bill in this way. The continuing resolution will result in harsh cuts to important education and health programs. This is an uncaring and thoughtless way to proceed on the budget and it does not reflect the priorities and needs of the American people. 
The people of Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota have suffered tremendous losses as a result of the devastating winter storms and 500-year spring floods. In Minnesota alone, over 20,000 people have been displaced from their homes, many of these families will not be able to return to their homes for weeks and months to come. The record flooding and cold temperatures have had a major economic impact on my State. From small businesses in East Grand Forks to dairy farmers who were unable to milk their herds or to transport milk. Where it is still very early in the process of assessing losses, the Federal Reserve Bank has already estimated that there has been a loss of over $1.2 billion in the Red River Valley alone. 
I want to congratulate Senators Stevens and Byrd for their commitment to get assistance out to disaster victims. I appreciate their commitment to continue to do all that we can to help families and businesses rebuild in the region. While this bill before us does not contain all the funding that the region will need to rebuild from the unbelievable losses caused by flooding and winter storms, it does provide the first installment of assistance. 
The emergency supplemental contains critical funding for the region, including $500 million in community development block grant funding, over $900 million in disaster assistance under FEMA, $54.7 million for EDA, and additional funding for transportation losses due to flooding and severe winter weather. 
The State of Minnesota learned in the 1993 that CDBG funding is one of the best vehicles to get assistance into the communities for rebuilding homes and businesses and for flood mitigation projects. I am glad that we were able to secure this additional CDBG assistance and the assurances from Senators Stevens and Byrd that they will support this funding level in conference. 
In addition, this bill contains a provision to require the administration to release $45 million in emergency contingency funding under the LIHEAP program for emergency energy needs of flood victims. As families begin to return to their homes in Ada, Breckenridge, Warren, and East Grand Forks, they will need this assistance to replace their heating systems. With this funding thousands of families will be able to return to their homes and do the hard work of cleaning up. 
Finally, I want to acknowledge the tremendous volunteer effort that continues in my State. On my visits to the Minnesota and Red River Valleys, I was touched by the sense of community among the residents. Many folks didn't care who they were working next to, as long as they were working for the common good. People worked tirelessly to build dikes to try to save homes and businesses and are now working tirelessly to help flood victims begin to clean their homes, schools, and businesses. In particular, I want to send a special word of thanks to all the high school students who volunteered on the frontlines. 
In the weeks and months ahead there will be many more hours of hard work; cleanup, removal of sandbags, restoration of buildings, ensuring that water supplies are not contaminated. People need not only the support of their neighbors, they need the support that only the Federal Government can provide. I am pleased that the Senate has acted and is now approving this package of much needed disaster assistance. With this funding, the flooded communities and families can begin to rebuild their towns, their businesses, and their lives.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I have introduced the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 1997. 
The purpose of this bill is to help expedite the naturalization of Hmong veterans who served and fought alongside the United States during the United States secret war in Laos. This legislation acknowledges their service and officially recognizes the service of Hmong and other ethnic Lao veterans who sacrificed and loyally fought for America and its principles of freedom, human rights, and democracy. 
This legislation continues the tradition of recognizing the service of those who came to the aid of the United States in times of war. Current law permits aliens or noncitizens who served honorably in the U.S. military forces during wartime to be naturalized, regardless of age, period of U.S. residence, or physical presence in the United States. However, expedited naturalization does not apply to Hmong and Lao veterans and their families because of the covert status of their work. This bill would help expedite this process by eliminating the literacy requirement in the naturalization process. 
Classified studies conducted by the defense policy think tank RAND have recently been declassified. They show the unique and important role that the Hmong people played during the Vietnam war. The studies reveal that this group, the `Secret Army,' specially created by the United States Government, played a critical role in the clandestine military activities in Laos. 
Hmong men, women, and children of all ages fought and died alongside U.S. military personnel in units recruited, organized, trained, funded and paid by the U.S. Government. It is estimated that during the United States involvement in Vietnam, 35,000 to 40,000 Hmong veterans and their families' were killed in conflict. 50,000 to 58,000 were wounded in conflict and an additional 2,500 to 3,000 were declared missing. 
During the Vietnam conflict, Hmong forces were responsible for risking their lives by crossing enemy lines to rescue downed American pilots. It is estimated that they saved at least 60 American lives and often lost half their troops rescuing one soldier. 
When the United States withdrew from Southeast Asia, thousands of Hmong were evacuated by the U.S. Government. However, many were left behind and experienced mass genocide at the hands of Communists. Many fled to neighboring Thailand. During their journey, many were murdered before they reached the Thai border. Even today, despite official denial by the Lao Government, the Communist regime of Laos continues to persecute and discriminate against the Hmong specifically because of their role in the United States secret army. 
Edgar Buell, the senior U.S. CIA official who worked with the Hmong secret army, explained their critical role on national television: 
`Everyone of them (Hmong) that died, that was an American back home that didn't die, or one that was injured that wasn't injured. Somebody in nearly every Hmong family was either fighting or died from fighting. They became refugees because we (the United States) encouraged them to fight for us. I promised myself: `Have no fear, we will take care of you.' 
It is now time to live up to earlier promises and take care of this group that so valiantly fought alongside American forces. We can only make good on our word by passing this legislation. 
Currently, many of the 45,000 former soldiers and their refugee family members living in the United States cannot become citizens because they lack the sufficient English language skills to pass the naturalization test. The intense and protracted war in Laos and the subsequent exodus of the Hmong veterans into squalid refugee camps did not permit these veterans the opportunity to attend school and learn English. Also, many suffer from injuries that occurred during the war that make learning difficult and frustrating. 
Because of the welfare and immigration reform bill enacted last Congress, aging, elderly, illiterate (in English), semiliterate and wounded soldiers--usually with large families--will suffer greatly because they are now facing the almost impossible task of immediately learning English and finding gainful employment. People like Chanh Chantalangsy are faced with an uncertain future: 
Chanh served in the secret army and was seriously wounded in his head, arm, and legs. After being in the hospital for 7 months, he returned to combat, serving in a CIA sponsored unit. Fleeing Laos, he spent 14 years in a refugee camp in Thailand. Realizing that the conditions in his country would not improve, Chanh left the refugee camp and came to the United States. He studied English for 5 years but it became evident that mental and physical injuries prevented him from learning English. In 1993, he was classified disabled and now receives $561 a month in SSI benefits. As of August, he could lose this small benefit. 
Given the unique role that the veterans served on behalf of the U.S. national security interests, we should waive the difficult naturalization requirements for this group. We have a responsibility to these people. This responsibility was supported by former CIA Director William Colby when he said to a House subcommittee: 
`The basic burden (of fighting in Laos) was born by the Hmong. We certainly encouraged them to fight. We enabled them to fight in many cases, and I think the spirit that they developed was in part a result of our offering of support and our provision of it.' 
Mr. President, it is now time to give our support. These people fought for our country for 15 years and came to the United States with an understanding that they would be cared for. One act of Congress, the welfare reform law, wiped out this understanding and threw the Hmong into a state of despair. They neither have the capacity to care for themselves if benefits are terminated, nor the ability to return to their homeland. I implore my colleagues to support one more act of Congress that would fulfill our pledge and our obligation.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to thank the senior Senator from Massachusetts for raising very profound, important questions about this budget agreement. I came to the floor of the Senate yesterday, and I said that I really believed that there is a quiet crisis in our Nation when we don't make the kind of investments in providing opportunities for all the children in our country and that I find this budget to be woefully inadequate when it comes to such a question. 
Mr. President, an agreement is fine, but the question is: At what cost? We don't want to leave a whole class of citizens behind. Mr. President, as I look at this budget, I have two questions, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts raised these questions in a very eloquent and important way. 
The first question: If, in fact, we are going to have these tax cuts, which, as we look over the first 10 years and beyond, accelerate and you have cuts in the capital gains tax and estate tax disproportionately flowing to the top 1 or 2 percent, then cuts in programs that are important to vulnerable citizens--nutrition, education, housing, you name it--really are harsh. This represents no standard of fairness to have tax benefits disproportionately benefiting the wealthy and at the same time eliminating opportunities for some of our most vulnerable citizens, especially children. 
Second, Mr. President, I said yesterday that I really worry about the symbolic politics--and I speak only for myself here. I said it yesterday, and I say it one more time, I speak more to my own colleagues in the Democratic Party. 
It is going to become very difficult for us to be talking about the early years, childhood development, the importance of investing in children, and the fact that for one out of every four children under the age of 3 and 4 in America, and for one out of every two children of color in America, it is going to be impossible to talk about our schools and the physical infrastructure when we have a budget that does not invest in these children. We don't have one cent invested now in the physical infrastructure in our schools. Rotting schools don't send children a very positive message about themselves. 
We know--the medical evidence is compelling--that we have to do so much more on the nutrition front, on the health care front, on the child care front, on the intellectual development front if all of our children in our Nation are going to be prepared for school, much less prepared for life. And there is precious little by way of investment in children and in educational opportunities for these children in America. 
So, Mr. President, I rise to just simply say to my colleagues that it is going to become very difficult for Democrats or, for that matter, all of us in the House and in the Senate to say that we are for children, that we are for opportunities, that we believe in our national values and the quality of opportunity when we do not make the investment. 
Mr. President, this is a budget without a soul. This is a budget without a soul. This is a budget that leaves too many Americans behind. This is a budget that will further intensify the profound problem of two Americas. We should have one America. We should have one America where all of our citizens--and let's start with our children and grandchildren--each and every one of them have the opportunity to reach their full potential. This budget doesn't make an investment in these children. This budget doesn't provide these children with these opportunities, and for the sake of tax cuts that in the main go to wealthy people, I don't see the standard of fairness. And I don't see the soul of this budget. I think we are making a terrible mistake. 
So, Mr. President, as much as I respect colleagues--I see my good friend, Senator Domenici, on the floor--my work will be to try to raise the bar, have amendments, and improve this piece of legislation so that, as a matter of fact, we have a budget that represents an investment in the future. When I talk about an investment in the future, I talk about an investment in children. That includes poor children in America. I do not want to leave them behind. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have an agreement on the floor. Let me thank especially Senator Hollings from South Carolina for his assistance. 
Mr. President, I want to give a little bit of context for this amendment because I think it is important for people to know what has happened and what had to happen. This is about Toradol, which is manufactured by the Hoffman-La Roche Co. 
By the way, I would like to thank the company. We had a very good discussion in my office yesterday with my staff. I appreciate their coming by. I understand exactly what they have been trying to do. 
Also, Mr. President, I want to make it clear that this went through the process. This was an effort that many people thought was a worthy one. So this is not a bashing on my part at all. 
Mr. President, the problem is as follows: This drug is an anti-inflammatory drug; very important. It can be taken orally, or it can be injected--very important--dealing with, for example, postoperative pain. It is a very important medication for pain reduction. About two-thirds to 80 percent of the market was in the injectable form. 
The effort in this supplemental appropriations bill was to go ahead with a 14-month patent extension, which would have been for 14 months of market exclusivity for Toradol, this one drug. That means there would have been only one drug available; no alternatives. There is every reason to believe that, as a matter of fact, there is a generic alternative which would have been the same kind of assistance for people but at much less cost. 
Mr. President, when we were making some projections about this, we felt that, on the basis of looking at the data, this would have been about a $350 million cost for consumers. I felt as a Senator that the one party that was left out of the negotiations was the consumer. I could say with a twinkle in my eye, in many ways I have always tried to be a Senator that pushes hard on the consumer end. While I think the company--I want to make this clear--Hoffman-La Roche Company has made some important arguments about the delays in getting drug approval, about some of the problems it had with GATT, and all of the rest, the fact of the matter is--this was my perspective, and this is the consumers' perspective--a 14-month patent extension would have been maybe $50 million to $60 million--maybe it was the injectable part, two-thirds of that--in additional cost passed on to consumers. I think we ought to be doing our very best to make sure that we get this kind of medication to consumers in the most cost-effective way possible. 
So, Mr. President, I think the only unfortunate part was--not the process; I think people worked hard, and they worked in good faith--but I don't think there was the representation for the consumers. 
This amendment knocks out this patent extension. Senator Hollings joins me in this amendment. We agreed. I believe that Senators on both sides of the aisle are now comfortable with 
this agreement. This amendment knocks out that patent extension. I think this is the right thing to do for consumers. 
This was an amendment that I offered for consumers in Minnesota and consumers in the country. I am very pleased that now, after some negotiation and discussion, we have agreement on this on the floor of the Senate. 
I understand the position of the pharmaceutical companies in this particular case. Again, I appreciate their work. But ultimately I think my job is to represent not so much the pharmaceutical companies but the consumers. On this point, I think there was divergent interest. I wanted to come down on the side of consumers. I am really pleased that Senator Hollings and other Senators have joined in this effort. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor. We can go further. I think we can proceed.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, first of all, say to my colleague from Alaska that I hope we will be able to eventually negotiate this out. We have been in contact with the Department of Health and Human Services to find out exactly what the need is in other States and see how we can make the best use of low-income energy assistance money to help people who have been the victims of floods. 
So I thought, that while I know that my colleague is willing to perhaps take this, that I might start by explaining this amendment, unless my colleague has remarks which he wants to make at the moment.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, perhaps I will then lay out the rationale for this. The reason I hesitate is that perhaps we might need, in the agreement, to work on another number. In other words, the $45 million was based upon the very best advice that I received from Governors of our States about what we needed. It may be that we are going to talk about other States as well, which I am pleased to do, however, I just want to have some understanding of what the need is and whether or not this is enough funding. Altogether I think there is a contingency fund of over $200 million that Health and Human Services has in the LIHEAP program. 
So, if my colleague would not mind, I would like to explain why I have offered this amendment. First of all, I very much appreciate the offer from the Senator from Alaska. 
I also want to say at the very beginning that both Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd have--I want people in Minnesota to know this--really left no stone unturned when it comes to this effort to get the assistance to people. I thank them.  
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-14-19970506</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I again appreciate the Senator from Alaska and his wisdom on this matter. The Senator is quite correct. 
A little bit of background about this: We have been working very hard with the administration over the last month to get them to release this contingency funding. I talked with the Office of Management and Budget and others about releasing some of this funding to the State of Minnesota. Under the best of all circumstances, you want to keep this contingency fund intact 
because you may need it for the summer cooling assistance. We don't normally think about that. But not too many summers ago we were faced with a tragic situation in our country where people actually died from the heat. I understand the need to keep some of that money in the contingency fund. It just so happens that this flooding and the extent of this devastation is unprecedented, and we are trying to take some of this fund to deal with an emergency--indeed, the emergency that confronts people in our States. 
Let me, first of all, explain the reason for this amendment. This money is in a contingency fund to provide assistance to people who really need that assistance, who are really faced with an emergency situation, and that is the case in Minnesota and the Dakotas. But what we are faced with in Minnesota is the situation where many people are now going back to their homes and they are trying to rebuild their lives. This money, which can be delivered expeditiously and will help people repair their furnaces so that they can begin the process of rebuilding their lives by cleaning up and moving back into their homes. 
If I could get both Senators' attention, if I could get the attention of the Senator from Alaska, I want to say to the Senator from Alaska and to the Senator from West Virginia that we will accept the very generous offer. We have now made some calls and this is fine with us. 
Maybe I could summarize this amendment and we will be done with it, if that is OK. 
Mr. President, in Minnesota alone, we have estimates of around $30 million to help people with their emergency energy needs. Once this amendment is accepted, and it will be and hopefully be part of this disaster relief bill, we are in a position, out in Minnesota, to deliver this assistance to people within a couple of weeks. We are talking about, roughly speaking, in Minnesota alone, about 16,000 households which will be eligible for this assistance. 
So, I say to my distinguished colleague from Alaska, and I say to my distinguished colleague from West Virginia as well: Thank you. I want this assistance to help people in, not just three States, but other States as well. It sounds like this additional funding will really make a difference. It sounds like a small amount. I thank my colleagues, all of my colleagues, because, while it may sound like a small amount, given the context of the overall disaster relief bill, this will be a huge help. I have been receiving a lot of calls from State officials and from families in Minnesota saying: Look, we are going home. We are trying to rebuild our homes, trying to rebuild our lives. If you could get just a little bit of assistance to us to repair our furnaces, for example, this would make all the difference in the world. 
I say to Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd, you have helped make all the difference in the world for some families in Minnesota. I thank you and I am very pleased to have this amendment accepted.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the budget agreement. Let me start out with a little bit of context. I will just read a figure from the fine work of the Center on Budget Priorities. In the last Congress, the 104th Congress, more than 93 percent of the budget reductions in entitlement programs came from programs for low-income people. 
Mr. President, in the last Congress, we cut about $50 billion in assistance for legal immigrants and also in the major food and nutrition program in this country, the Food Stamp Program. Please remember, Mr. President, that the vast majority of the beneficiaries of the Food Stamp Program are children in working-poor families, on the average, with an income of below $6,500 a year. Those benefits were cut by 20 percent over the next 5 years--a 20-percent cut. 
Mr. President, I give that by way of background because now we have a budget agreement, and I suppose it can be argued that an agreement is good because you have people coming together. But the question is: At what cost? 
Mr. President, I don't see much of a standard of fairness in this agreement. I suppose, in many ways, my challenge is more to Democrats than to Republicans when I speak here on the floor. I think that when we go through this budget and we look at the cuts in discretionary programs, we will find, again, that, inevitably, the disproportional number of these cuts will be in programs that are most important to the most vulnerable citizens in this country. Many of them are poor children in America. I do know, Mr. President, that the discretionary part of this budget in relation to GDP is the lowest percentage it has been in 40 years. 
Mr. President, if I juxtapose what will be further reductions in assistance for some of the most vulnerable citizens in our country on top of what we did in the last Congress, with $85 billion over the first 5 years and another $165 billion over the next 5 years, $250 billion in tax cuts, and then looking from about 2008 to 2017, about an additional $400 billion as you look at the impact of cuts in capital gains tax and estate tax, many of those benefits will flow to the top 1, 2, 3 percent of the population. 
I want to just ask my colleagues, and I would like to ask the President: Where is the standard of fairness? Where is the standard of fairness? Where is our soul as a party that has a reputation for being willing to fight for ordinary people, being willing to fight for working people and working families, being willing to fight for opportunities for children. 
Mr. President, I think we have to be very careful about what I would call, for use of a better description, symbolic politics. What do I mean by that? I mean, Mr. President, that if you look at this budget and you think back to just a few weeks ago, with the conference at the White House on the development of the brain and the importance of early childhood development and what we must do to make sure that every woman expecting a child has an adequate diet, make sure there is nutrition for children, to make sure that there is health care for children, and to make sure that there is intellectual development and good child care, remembering that one out of every four children in our country are growing up poor in America and one out of every two children of color are growing up poor in America. Mr. President, I don't see in this budget anything that advances the cause of these children. I see only a retreat. Where is the investment? Where is the investment in our children? 
Mr. President, we have been focusing on the budget deficit. How about the investment deficit? How about the spiritual deficit? I thought that now that the medical evidence is irrefutable and irreducible and so compelling that if we don't get it right for all of God's children in our country in their early years, they may 
never come to school ready to learn, and they certainly will not be ready for life. I thought we were going to make investments to make sure they had opportunities. 
This budget still doesn't fully fund the Head Start Program. I could explain that when there was a Republican President, President Reagan or President Bush. I have a hard time explaining that with a Democrat President. 
On the supplemental, in the Senate and House, we are still in a battle to make sure that we get the WIC funding that we need. We are still not there. Mr. President, I read a foundation report. David Packard, who used to be Undersecretary of Defense with President Reagan, points out that whether it is child care at home, or whether it is center-based child care, or whether you need to do to have more child care at a place of business, however you look at it--and we are not talking about just poor children or low-income families, we are talking about the vast majority of families in our country who are concerned about how to make a decent living and also how to give their children the care they know their children deserve. I think of our own children. Sheila and I have children in their twenties and early thirties. They have children, and I think of their incomes and the cost of child care and how important this is for families. Where is the investment? Where is the investment? 
Mr. President, I just suggest that there is something wrong. There is something terribly wrong. There is a quiet crisis in a Nation--our Nation--when we don't do better for our children. We have conferences and say we are for children and we love to have our photos taken next to children, and we don't make the investment. We now know the neuroscience evidence is compelling that children must have good nutrition and health care, and there certainly must be affordable, good child care, however delivered, at the local community level, and we know it is going to require some funding and investment. That is not in this budget agreement. Have we now locked ourselves in, over the next 5, 6 years, to saying we will not make this investment? 
Mr. President, I say to my own colleagues--Democrats--in the past month or so, we have beamed back to our homes pictures of dilapidated school buildings. We were going to focus on doing something about too many rotting schools in our Nation. We, as Democrats, were going to take a stand on this, and we should. Mr. President, it is not exactly the right message for children when they go into schools, whether it be in Anacostia, 2 miles from here, or in any of our States in some of our inner city neighborhoods and the buildings are dilapidated, the toilets don't work, the heating doesn't work. We are saying to these children: We don't care about you. We don't give a damn about you. 
Mr. President, that is a Federal responsibility. That is infrastructure. And Democrats, we beam these pictures back of these buildings and we are the party of commitment. Well, Mr. President, in this budget agreement, the $5 billion plan for school renovation was knocked out. Now, actually, it would cost much more than that. It was knocked out. It was abandoned. So, to my colleagues, let's not say that we are concerned about rotting school buildings for too many children in America and then sign on to a budget agreement that doesn't invest one cent --one cent--in making sure that these are safe buildings for our children. Let's not do that. That is just symbolic politics. That is symbolic politics at its worst. 
Mr. President, we don't even take a baby step toward investment in children and opportunities for children. We don't even make a dent at all. At the same time, we are going to have $250 billion of tax cuts, a large percentage of which benefits those at the very top of the income ladder, at the same time we have done precious little by way of reductions in Pentagon budget, and at the same time this other whole area that apparently we really don't want to go after in any significant degree, called corporate welfare, the loopholes and deductions for a variety of interests in the country, remains almost untouched. What kind of standard of fairness is that? 
Mr. President, we have a quiet crisis in a nation that believes we can go forward as a national community with two Americas. We can't do that. There is another America. 
Unfortunately, that other America includes many children who will never have a chance to reach their full potential if we as a Senate and a House of Representatives do not make some investment in their future. This budget is a budget without a soul when it comes to the concerns and circumstances of these children. 
So, Mr. President, when it comes to investment in children and education, I do not believe I am articulating a position that is one that people in the country don't support. I believe people believe that this is the goodness of our country. This is the American dream to make sure that every child has these opportunities. We have set the bar in this budget agreement right here. I want the bar to be set up here. If my colleague, Paul Simon, from Illinois was here today he would say that we can do better. Mr. President, we can do better. 
So I am going to come to the floor of the Senate with some amendments. These amendments are going to call for us to do better. These amendments are going to essentially say to the people in the country, `Don't judge us by the words we speak. Judge us by the budgets that we write.' These amendments are going to say to colleagues, `Please don't separate the legislative lives you live from the words you speak.' And, if you say you are for the children, and you say early childhood development is so important, and you say you are for a quality of opportunity for every child, regardless of color of skin, regardless of rich, or poor, regardless of urban, or rural, then clearly we are going to have to do better. If you say that we should not have these rotting schools in our country--and what all of the local school districts say to us in their plea to us is important and please invest some money in infrastructure, then you have to invest. That has to be in the budget. And, if you say that you understand that these early years are so important, you know it as a father or as a mother, you know it as a grandfather, or a grandmother--we have always known intuitively how important these early years are--and they are important for all children. And children don't do well in school, if they don't have an adequate diet. And children don't do well in school, if they are in pain or discomfort because they haven't been able to receive medical care. And children don't do well in school, if they have not had really good child care that nurtures their development, whether they are at home, or one or both parents are working. And, if you say all of that--and almost all of you do--it is time to invest. Time is not neutral for these children. We keep talking about the children. 
So, Mr. President, I am going to introduce a number of amendments to take the bar up here. I might lose, or I might win. But I am going to really fight hard. I would just say to the President `Mr. President,'--I am talking now to the President at the White House, President Clinton--`we can do better.' 
I don't see the standard of fairness. I don't see an agreement with major tax cuts, and so much revenue lost over the next 10 years and 20 years to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars benefiting many people who do not even need the assistance, and at the same time a budget agreement that represents a retreat and abandon of too many children in America. 
We have had enough conferences. Enough books have been written. Enough pleas have been made. There has been enough blitz. It is time now that we match our words with the deeds. And the deed is to make this investment. 
Mr. President, this will be my major priority over the next month to come in the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be brief. Minnesota is one of these States, too, and every day we come here and speak briefly because we just keep trying to pitch away. 
Could I ask one question? I think the Senator recognizes I would rather give a statement. I will not. But is it not true that when you talk to people in North Dakota--I certainly find this to be the case in Minnesota--they just do not understand at all how it can be that we just do not get this to them and how there can be this discussion of amendments having to do with budget cuts in education and budgets cuts in any number of other areas? 
I say to the Senator, if I could get his attention for a moment, the most difficult thing for me is to try to explain to people how it could be we are at this impasse and that we cannot get the help to people as quickly as possible. In terms of how they live their own lives, people do not understand this kind of discussion about strategy and tactics and they feel as if we are just playing with their lives. 
Does the Senator have trouble explaining to people why it is we cannot get this done for them?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will actually be relatively brief for now. We are going to have time for plenty of discussion and debate. In its present form--and I appreciate the words of my colleague from Missouri--this piece of legislation might better be called the Paycheck Reduction Act. I will just go over some bullet points and marshal evidence behind each. 
Pay cut eliminates the guarantee of pay for overtime work for 65 million American workers. Mr. President, we passed the Fair Labor Standards Act over half a century ago. It was an important piece of legislation. It represented real progress for working families. The idea was that if you worked over a 40-hour week, you would get paid time and a half. That is an important principle. This piece of legislation essentially turns the clock back over a half a century. In a way it is a nonstarter for that reason alone. 
Interestingly enough, we had an amendment when we were marking up the bill in committee which essentially said, at least don't give the employer all the power so that an employer is in a position to say to someone, Look, we will not give you time and a half compensation for overtime work. We will give you flextime. So the employer is in a situation to say to a worker, OK, you worked an hour over; we'll give you a flextime hour--that is hour to hour--but we won't offer flexible compensation at time and a half. That was voted down. 
Benefits cut. Health and retirement benefits based on hours worked would be slashed. 
Abolishes the 40-hour week. Employee could work up to 80 hours in a week without receiving overtime pay. That is just unbelievable. Everybody should understand this. This is a sacred principle. The reason we passed the Fair Labor Standards Act is that many employees, some the very employees Senator Ashcroft was discussing, do not have a lot of clout vis-a-vis their employers. 
The idea was to have some basic protection, so that if you were working hard to support a family and you worked overtime, you would get paid overtime. That assurance is abolished. Under this legislation, an employee could be working 50 or 60 hours a week or more and not get paid any overtime for that. To move away from the 40-hour week turns the clock back about a half a century. 
Finally, No employee choice. Employer chooses who and when. Employer determines who works overtime and when an employee can use comp time. This is, in many ways, one of the most troubling features of this legislation. Please remember, and we had testimony in our subcommittee on this, there are companies that really work well with employees. They have good partnerships, and there are situations where an employee works 4 days a week, 10 hours a day and takes off Friday. That can be done now. You do not need to overturn the Fair Labor Standards Act. You do not need to overturn the 40-hour week. That can be done now. 
Or what people can do is work 9 hours a day as opposed to 8 hours and then work half a day on a Friday or on a Monday. That can be done now within the existing framework of labor law. 
Or people can go in at 7 and come home at 3 or come in at 10 and go home at 6. There are all sorts of flexible arrangements. Right now, employers can give their employees this flexibility if they so desire. The problem is, a lot of employers do not do that. But it has nothing to do with the basic principle of the 40-hour week, and the principle that if an employee works overtime, he or she should get time and a half pay. This legislation undercuts that. 
Mr. President, that hardly represents a step forward for working people in this country. That is why, in its present form, this is the Paycheck Reduction Act. And that is why we are adamantly opposed to it. That is why most people in the country will be opposed to it when they learn all the provisions in the legislation. 
This is my last point for today. Mr. President, what is interesting about this is it is all done in the name of choice. But you know, we had some interesting amendments in committee that speak to this question. 
I offered an amendment which said we have a Family Medical Leave Act right now which says that there are up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in the case of sickness of a child or an adult, so why don't we say this: If an employee has banked 10 hours of earned comp time, and she calls her employer and says, `Look, I need that time off because my child is sick,' she gets it automatically. The employer does not get to shut her down and say no. If you want to give the employee choice, do not give all the power to the employers. But, Mr. President, that amendment was voted down. 
We had another amendment which took some parts of the labor force--for example, garment workers--and said, we have a lot of people right now who, whatever the law of the land says, are not even getting paid minimum wage or earned overtime. We have a lot of examples of forced and unpaid overtime, and we have a whole backload of unfair labor practices. So couldn't we at least exempt some sectors of the work force where we know people are vulnerable and somewhat powerless and, as a matter of fact, have been exploited by some employers? Thank goodness most employers are not that way. But that amendment went down as well. 
Mr. President, one other example. We had discussion where we said, wait a minute, we have this backload, we have all sorts of potential for abuse. Can't we at least have a commitment of resources so we have some enforcement? 
You are going to need more people within the Department of Labor to enforce this to make sure that people are not forced to work overtime without overtime pay because no matter what you say in theory--about this being voluntary--the vast majority of people who work can tell you right now they do not always have a lot of choices. A whole lot of people put up with really awful working conditions. They put up with unsafe working conditions. They put up with situations that none of us would want to be in. But they do it to put food on the table. So couldn't we at least provide people with some protection? That is not here either. 
Mr. President, with all due respect, this bill is hardly giving people more flexibility. That is the way it sounds at first blush. But what really is at issue here is you essentially overturn portions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, you overturn the 40-hour week, you put people in the situation where the employer--and in most situations the employer has the power--is going to say to people, `Hey, we're pleased to give you flextime,' or, `We're pleased to give you an hour off, but it's hour for hour, even if you worked overtime. Even if you've banked hours, we're not going to give you time and a half compensation when you want and need it.' 
Let me tell you, the reason people work is because they need that pay to put food on the table. The reason you have so many families where both people work, both husband and wife, is because they need the income. 
I do not think people are interested in seeing their paycheck cut. I do not think people are interested in being put in a situation where they no longer receive time-and-a-half overtime compensation. I do not think people are going to be pleased with a piece of legislation that abolishes the 40-hour week. And I do not think people are going to be pleased with a piece of legislation which sounds great in theory about employee choice, but does not have any of the provisions in it which would really guarantee that that would be a reality. 
So, Mr. President, I have a budget meeting, and I apologize, 
because I like to debate with my colleague from Missouri. I promise him I will be on the floor whenever we get back to this, to hear what he says and go back and forth--and with my good friend from Ohio. These two are my good friends. We do not always agree, but they are two Senators I really do like and respect. I feel badly about speaking and leaving, but only because we have this budget meeting right now. In any case, Mr. President, what I said was so compelling, what I said is irrefutable and irreducible, and I do not think they could possibly respond to it anyway. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, whatever interpretation Senators want to make about project labor agreements--I am not here to debate that now--I think that really what we ought to focus on is the vote we are about to take. And whatever interpretation Senators want to make about how we reached agreement, I am not here to debate that. 
I thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their fine leadership. I do know this. Senator Specter I think was quite correct in his remarks. I think there has been concern around the country about the treatment of Alexis Herman, making sure there was fair treatment. Clearly we are going to have a vote, and I think it is going to be an overwhelmingly positive vote. Above and beyond Ms. Herman, I think the issue is this position. It has been 6 long months. The Secretary of Labor position is so important to the lives of so many families all across the Nation--Minnesota, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Vermont, and beyond. Bob Reich was a great Secretary of Labor--a great Secretary of Labor--and I think the reason he became beloved to so many people in the country was that he was such a forceable and outspoken advocate and he was talking about living standards for people, about educational opportunities, about job training, about jobs at decent wages, and about parents being able to support their children. The Secretary of Labor is the most important position we have in the Cabinet when it comes to these critical issues, these bread and butter economic issues, whether or not we fulfill our national vow of equality of opportunity, which is all about decent jobs and decent educational opportunities. 
I hope that there will be an overwhelming--and I think there will be--vote in support of Alexis Herman. I think, as Senator Kennedy said, her own journey is inspiring. I think in many ways for an eloquent African-American woman to be Secretary of Labor, with all of the skill she brings to this position and with all the leadership that she can provide on behalf of working families, it is an inspiring story. I think this is an enormous victory not just for one person and not just for people in the African-American community, but really for the country. So I hope we will have a very strong vote for her. 
I thank the chair of our committee, Senator Jeffords, and I thank Senator Kennedy and thank in advance all the Senators who I think will vote for her. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be introducing the Family Violence Option II, a bill to clarify the Wellstone/Murray Family violence option Act contained in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Last summer, Senator Murray and I introduced the family violence amendment to the welfare bill to give States the flexibility to identify victims and survivors of domestic abuse and, if necessary, to provide more time to remove the domestic violence barrier so that victims would be able to move into the work force. Our provision was changed to a State option, but that did not change the intent of the legislation. 
States helping battered women should not be penalized for not having the requisite number of women at work in a given month if domestic violence is the reason. Most importantly, battered women should not be competing with the myriad people with disabilities that prevent them from working. Abuse victims and survivors may simply need a little more time. That is why the family violence option allows States to grant temporary waivers, not exemptions. 
Many States have adopted the family violence option, others, some version of it, but most have had great difficulty figuring out what taking the option would mean. Senator Murray and I want to make sure States that take domestic abuse into account when setting work goals will not pay a price. Therefore, this bill makes it clear that victims of domestic abuse will not be counted in the 20 percent hardship exemption and States who grant temporary waivers of work requirements to abuse survivors will not be penalized if they fail to meet their work requirements. 
Evidence continues to emerge about the high number of incidents of domestic abuse or a history of abuse among welfare recipients. Most recently, a joint study from the Taylor Institute in Chicago and the University of Michigan confirmed that large numbers of women on AFDC are survivors or current victims. Four recent studies--conducted by Passaic County, NJ, Univ. of Massachusetts, Northwestern University, and the Better Homes Fund in Worcester, MA--document that at least 14 percent--Passaic County, NJ--and as high as 32 percent--Worcester, MA--of women on AFDC were currently being abused. The numbers were more than twice those percentages for a history of abuse. 
Given the extent of this problem, it is imperative that States be able to work at a more individualized pace, not a one-size-fits-all approach. I would like to share a story about a woman from Minnesota who has used the safety net of public assistance to free herself and her children from violence, obtain job skills and training, and become self-supporting. 
Edith is a woman who has defied the odds. She had her first child at the age of 16. By the time she was in her early twenties, she had become an intravenous drug user, had three more children, and was in an extremely violent relationship. Edith's abuser beat her routinely and savagely, sending her to the emergency room again and again. As Edith says, `Finally, I realized that to save my life and my mental stability, I had to get away.' She waited until her abuser had passed out and carefully pried the car keys from his hand and fled Gary, IN, with her young sons. 
Edith fled to Minnesota because she had family there. Within months her abuser found her, forcing her to flee to a battered women's shelter. Edith quickly realized that if she was ever going to be able to support her children, she would need to get the educational and job training that she desperately needed. It was at that point that Edith contacted Cornerstone's Transitional Housing Program. Cornerstone is a successful women's advocacy program in Bloomington, MN. 
Edith and her children came into the program in 1992. Utilizing educational and vocational resources, Edith entered a vocational program for electricians. While in Cornerstone's Transitional Housing Program, Edith was able to address the many issues that had resulted from her battering, including parenting, bad credit, and chemical dependency, just to name a few. With support of the program staff, Edith completed the apprenticeship and graduated from the Cornerstone program. 
I am proud to tell you that Edith will become a licensed electrician this summer. She has just purchased her first home and has set a new goal to become a contractor. Edith would tell you that had she not been given the time and the opportunity to participate in a transitional housing program specifically for battered women, she could not have accomplished all of her goals. 
We need to insure that women like Edith have the support system in place to escape abusive situations, make the transition to work, and then stay working. When women can support themselves and their children they can stay away from abusive partners and keep themselves and their families safe. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with over 1,400 of my constituents from Minnesota who have signed a petition calling for the payment of all of the United States' legal obligations to the United Nations by the immediate payment of all dues in arrears. I agree with my constituents that it is embarrassing that the United States, the richest and most powerful nation on Earth, expects the United Nations to provide peacekeeping and humanitarian aid in response to the world's conflicts but does not honor its financial responsibility to the United Nations. 
With several billion dollars of uncollected dues, the United Nations is now in dire straits. Consequently, it must borrow from scarce funds allocated for peacekeeping operations simply to pay staff salaries and to meet its other financial obligations. 
Of the unpaid dues approximately half are owed by the United States. Rather than providing other U.N. members with an example of international responsibility, our Nation is doing just the opposite. This makes the United Nations increasingly incapable of carrying out numerous tasks that are clearly in our Nation's interest but that we ourselves are either unable or unwilling to perform.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
First of all, let me just say to my colleague from Indiana that I really appreciate much of what he said, and I also appreciate his passion. I do not know anybody more committed to this whole idea of volunteer citizen action and helping people. I deeply respect him for it. 
Mr. President, I think that one of the things I want people to know who are watching this debate is that there are some other things going on in the Senate right now that are extremely important. This piece of legislation, I think, can be debated and people can deal with the substance of it, but at the moment, just speaking for Minnesota, and I know there are other Senators that feel very strongly about this in the Dakotas, we have a disaster relief bill we are trying to get through the Senate. 
Mr. President, I think one of the stumbling blocks right now--and I am really sorry that my colleague from Georgia is faced with this, because I think it has nothing to do with him at all--with the disaster relief bill, on the one hand you have people like Chairman Stevens of the Appropriations Committee pushing hard to help. I am sure of that. But you now have a proposal--and I am not sure who exactly is playing this game, and it is a game--to attach a continuing resolution on to a disaster relief bill. Mr. President, I think that is the problem we are faced with. 
The whole issue of liability, the whole question of what kind of tort reform there might be in relation to nonprofits and citizen volunteer efforts is important. We should get to that legislation. We should vote it up or down. I am pleased to debate it. But at the moment I say that I think the business of the Senate and the House is to get the assistance to people who have really been faced with a real disaster in their lives. People in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, everybody that lived in the city had to vacate. People are not going to be able to get back on their own two feet. They will not be able to repair their homes. They will not be able to start their businesses again. This is a life-or-death issue. I do not think I am being melodramatic. We were so hopeful there would be action. 
Again, I thank Chairman Stevens for his work, and certainly Senator Byrd for his work, but now we have a development which, essentially, led to the committee today essentially having to call off its business. It is this proposal that comes from somebody, or somebodies, to attach a continuing resolution. 
Now, for people who are listening to this debate and wondering what is that all about, let me just be clear about it. What this continuing resolution would do is, it would essentially attach on to a disaster relief bill 98 percent of this budget, although if you look to next year, it amounts to a 7-percent cut. In other words, rather than having up-or-down votes on appropriations bills, having an honest debate about what our priorities are or are not, some people would like to play this game of attaching on to what was supposed to be a disaster relief bill to provide assistance to families who were waiting for this assistance, who are hoping for this assistance, who are paying for this assistance, now we have this new effort which would put into effect cuts in the Pell grant program--I will not even go through all the statistics--work-study program, education for disadvantaged children, literacy programs, National Institutes of Health programs, Head Start, senior nutrition, the list goes on. 
Mr. President, in all due respect, I do not know whose proposal this is, but I think it is a cowardly way--and I am pleased to debate anybody who wants to debate me--it is a cowardly way of loading junk on to a disaster relief bill. 
Mr. President, again, I give all the credit in the world to people like Senator Stevens, who is in there pitching for us, but I do not know who decided to do this, but it is really crass. Mr. President, the President has already said that he would veto such a piece of legislation because, as President of the United States of America, he cannot go back on a commitment he has made to people, the commitment he has made to Pell grants and higher education, the commitment he has made to Head Start, the commitment he made to nutrition programs for senior citizens, he cannot put, through the back door, cuts in those programs. 
I make a plea, and I would like to have a discussion with my colleague from South Dakota about this. I would like to make a strong plea to colleagues. Please join the efforts of Senators like Senator Stevens, who is in there pitching for us. Please understand there are people in the Dakotas and Minnesota who are really praying for help, who believe we will come through for them, who believe we will be able to help their families, who believe we will be able to help them get on their own two feet so they have a chance to rebuild their lives. Please do not attach this junk on to what is supposed to be a disaster relief bill. The business of the Congress right now ought to be to pass this disaster relief bill and get the assistance to people who need it. 
I just ask my colleagues, the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from South Dakota, what you are hearing from your own States?

Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague--and I am pleased to take questions from both of my colleagues--he is quite right. It is a nightmare. It is something that nobody ever could have predicted, and everybody had to be evacuated from East Grand Forks. In other towns, like Breckenridge or Ada, not everybody in the town had to leave, but in Ada, the school is destroyed and has to be rebuilt. People had to be evacuated from a nursing home. There was a tremendous amount of damage. The community center was essentially destroyed. In Breckenridge, I met small business people who said, `We need start-up grant assistance.' 
Again, I say to my colleagues, I understand the importance of this piece of legislation that is on the floor. But at this point in time, I think the first priority ought to be to get this disaster relief to people. I believe we operate by the rule, Mr. President--I always have as a Senator--that it is `there but for the grace of God go I.' I have always voted for disaster assistance for other States because I know something like this could happen to people in Minnesota. We count on people being there with us. I don't want this to be something that is symbolic. We need to get assistance to people--not 100 percent replacement, but at least something to help them get back on their own two feet.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, in response to my colleague from South Dakota, first of all, he is quite correct about what this continuing resolution would mean in personal terms for people in our States. Actually, if you look at a 98-percent cut--we can see where other cuts have taken place. As a matter of fact--and my colleague outlined some of the figures--let's translate it into personal terms one more time. I do not believe that people in South Dakota or Minnesota or others across the country are interested in reductions in financial aid and Pell grants so that higher education can be more affordable. I do not believe that. We have been reading about and talking about the very early years being so important in the development of the brain, that we have to make sure children at a very young age have adequate nutrition. Do you know what? We can't play symbolic politics with children's lives. If we are going to be espousing that, we better make the investment. I don't think people want to see cuts in nutrition programs for children.

<DOCNO>105-wellstone-mn-5-19970429</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from South Dakota that that is precisely the case. I was simply trying to make the argument that I believe these cuts are not acceptable to people in the country, and this is not an intellectually honest or policy-honest way of doing it. We can have the debate on all these appropriations bills and we can have up-or-down votes and be accountable. I think this is a very cowardly way--and that is a pretty strong word to use--or a back-door approach to try to make cuts in some of these programs that are so important to the lives of the people we represent, and it is just adding junk onto what should be a straight disaster relief bill. 
Let's not play around with the lives of the people in the 22 affected States. I invite any of my colleagues, I say to my colleague from South Dakota, before you do something like this--and, again, I know Chairman Stevens has tried to be in there pitching for the people in our States--before you play this kind of game, come on out and look into the faces and eyes of some of the people. They are like refugees. The people in our States are like refugees. They are homeless and are trying 
to get back home and are trying to repair their homes. They are trying to move back into their homes with their children. Why play this kind of game with their lives? Let's bring this disaster relief bill before the Senate, and let's get the assistance out there to people who need it. 
If my colleagues then want to propose reductions in Pell grants and nutrition programs for senior citizens and reductions in the Women, Infants, and Children Program, and in all of the veterans benefits, go ahead and do it. We will debate it all. But this is an effort to essentially close off debate, not be accountable. I say to my colleague from South Dakota, the political part of it that I think is worst of all is those who are playing this game--and I hope it is very few, so they will back off--know the President will veto it. He would have no other choice. But then people are still waiting back in our States. 
So we urge our colleagues to please not go forward with this proposal. I cannot say anything more important right now. I say to my colleagues from Georgia and Wyoming, it is not the debate you and I will really soon finish up. But I know if you were out here and it was your States, you would be saying the same thing. Please, just get a disaster relief bill through, and then whatever you want to add or debate by way of priorities on the budget, or wherever you want to cut, or whatever, we can debate that. But don't do it on a disaster relief bill. Please don't add this continuing resolution onto a disaster relief bill. Please don't junk it up. Leave it the way it is. Let's try to get the best possible assistance program through the Senate and the House. Let's try to get relief to these people. 
These people are really down. But in our States we have seen the worst of times bring out the best in people. It is just amazing. We were talking about volunteer efforts. It is amazing the number of people who were sandbagging and who have taken strangers into their homes, and the number of people who have done food drives, and the number of people who are helping in every possible way. But it is really hard; it is really hard when you have been flooded out of your home, when you have had to leave your community. We need to give these people some hope now. The best way to give them hope is to try to get some of this assistance to the people. 
The reason I speak with some indignation is that I thought we were going to be able to move forward. I hoped we would be able to move forward Thursday in the Appropriations Committee. There are two different issues. No. 1, we have to make sure we have categories of assistance that provide the help to individual people. We have to have the flexibility and we have to give enough money to help people get on their own two feet to rebuild their lives. No. 2, we have the threat of adding a continuing resolution, which is a huge mistake. It is playing games with disaster relief. It is playing games with the agony of people. It is playing games with the pain of people. It is playing games with families in our States. It is profoundly mistaken, it is profoundly wrong, and I hope whoever is thinking about doing this will please not do it. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for letting me speak. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield for a question, I want to ask this question of the Senator because I have to leave soon. I didn't want to walk out because he makes a very important point. Would the Senator agree with me that it would 
be best if we could come together as two parties and work out these disagreements when it comes to what is going to be on the disaster relief bill or when it comes to Alexis Herman or judicial appointments, that we can work out an agreement and stop basically leveraging different pieces of legislation? I don't agree with the Senator on some substantive grounds. But I am sorry the Senator is caught up in this. I mean that sincerely. Would he agree with me that we really have to come together and work these things out? Because I understand the Senator's conviction about this particular piece of legislation, but I also hope that the Senator will understand my conviction about the mistakes of now adding a continuing resolution and trying to put into effect all sorts of budget cuts onto a bill that should be a disaster relief bill. Does the Senator agree that we need to get away from all of this?

Mr. President, this is blatant politics at its worst. Alexis Herman was voted unanimously out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. She is eminently well qualified. This is an extremely important position to working people, to working families. We have a lot of important legislation before us--the TEAM Act, comptime, flextime. We are supposed to be focusing on living wage jobs and educational opportunities for our citizens. The Secretary of Labor is a critical position. She should not be held hostage. If the majority party does not like an action taken by the administration, then oppose that action. Do not hold Alexis Herman hostage. Free her. Let her become Secretary of Labor and let her serve working families all across this country.

I actually think that I was able to do this in a minute. Again, I think that it really behooves the Senate to move forward on this nomination. I do not think the Senate looks good as an institution. I think people really do not like this kind of inside politics where a particular party--in this case it is the majority party--does not agree with a particular policy or particular action taken by the President or the executive branch and then chooses to hold someone else, in this particular case Alexis Herman, hostage. It is not the way we should be conducting our business. It is not fair to her, an eminently well qualified candidate to serve our country and, quite frankly, it is not fair to families all across Minnesota and all across the Nation that are focused on good jobs, education, and safe workplaces. These are workaday majority issues. This is the Secretary of Labor--6 months without a Secretary of Labor. Again, do not hold her hostage. Free her and let us move forward. If my colleagues want to vote against her, vote against her, but she deserves a vote in this Chamber. 
I thank my colleague from Georgia for his graciousness.

I think people really do not like this kind of inside politics where a particular party--in this case it is the majority party--does not agree with a particular policy or particular action taken by the President or the executive branch and then chooses to hold someone else, in this particular case Alexis Herman, hostage. It is not the way we should be conducting our business. It is not fair to her, an eminently well qualified candidate to serve our country and, quite frankly, it is not fair to families all across Minnesota and all across the Nation that are focused on good jobs, education, and safe workplaces. These are workaday issues. This is the Secretary of Labor--6 months without a Secretary of Labor. Again, do not hold her hostage. 
Free her and let us move forward. If my colleagues want to vote against her, vote against her, but she deserves a vote in this Chamber. 
I thank my colleague from Georgia for his graciousness.

Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, I would like to welcome, so that this would be part of the Congressional Record, the really beautiful children of St. Ann Episcopal Church in the South Bronx who came here yesterday for a visit. These are wonderful children. They were written about in Jonathan Kozol's book `Amazing Grace: The Lives of Children in the Conscience of a Nation.' I wish to let those children know that it was really wonderful to have them here in the Nation's Capitol and I am sure that someday some of them will serve in the Senate.

Mr. WELLSTONE. On a second topic that is clearly related to this topic, Mr. President, I had an opportunity to talk to Senator Bumpers and Senator Cochran, who are going to be very key in the appropriations bill, who are working on this supplemental appropriations bill, and I would like to thank them for their effort to really restore adequate funding for the Women, Infants, and Children Program. I think Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers are very committed to doing it. Both the Washington Post and New York Times had editorials yesterday. 
The problem is what we get coming over from the House as opposed to an additional $76 million that the White House now realizes it needs to make sure that 180,000 women and infant children are not falling between the cracks with inadequate care. This has to do with avoiding low birthweight, childhood anemia, this has to do, frankly, with the whole issue of infant mortality. I cannot think of anything more cruel than for us not to fully fund this program. It works. There has not been one study by anybody, anywhere that has made the case that we must not invest in nutrition for our children. 
I am really hopeful that when we mark this bill up next week on the Senate side we will get it right and we will not turn our gaze away from the conditions of children. Too many children are malnourished. Too many women who are expecting children are malnourished.

Mr. WELLSTONE. The third point, Mr. President--and I just have four to make in a short period of time--I come to the floor today to also urge my colleagues to move forward with final confirmation of Alexis Herman as Secretary of Labor. Really, I think it is time to let her go free. 
Mr. President, you and I are both on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. By unanimous vote, we passed her out of the committee. She is eminently qualified. We have a lot of work to do. We have a controversial TEAM Act that is going to be before us. We have the bill which we spent a lot of time on, the comp-time, flextime bill that has passed out of committee and that is going to come before us. I have been the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Employment and Training. I think Senator DeWine is doing an excellent job. We are very serious about moving forward with this job training, work force development bill, but we do not have a Secretary of Labor. 
Quite frankly, I do not think that people in the Senate should be holding her hostage. They may agree or disagree with a particular Executive order by the President. I do not come here to debate that, although I agree with the President on what he has done. But the point is, it is just absolutely outrageous to hold her hostage, and it is time to free her. It is time to let Alexis Herman, who is eminently well qualified to be Secretary of Labor, become Secretary of Labor. 
Please remember, this is a Cabinet-level position connected to the concerns and circumstances of the vast majority of people in this country who are focused on living wage jobs, who are focused on employment conditions, and who are focused on being able to make a decent living for their children, who are focused on economic security for themselves and their families. This is no small position. It is time to let her go forward. 
Mr. President, I know that if that does not happen, we will have a major confrontation here in the Senate and I wish we would not have to have it. I hope we do not get to that point, but really it is time to let her free and it is time to no longer hold her hostage.

Mr. WELLSTONE. My last point, Mr. President, which is again related--and I see my colleague from North Dakota has now come to the floor--is that one of the things I hope we will do next week--the sooner the better and I hope we will do it right--is, please, colleagues, help all of us out from the States of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and some other States as well. Many of the people who we truly love have just been devastated by this flooding. It really seems of Biblical proportions. It is unbelievable what has happened. 
We are now trying to put together a disaster relief bill to enable people to get back on their own two feet, to be able to rebuild their lives, and to rebuild our communities. The bill that is coming over from the House Appropriations Committee takes us in that direction, but we have to do better on the Senate side. This is, of course, evolving. We do not know the extent of the damage yet. But I ask my colleagues, I plead with my colleagues, please give us all of your support. We are going to have to especially make sure that we get the assistance directly to individuals. 
For a lot of our small businesses that have been completely wiped out, completely wiped out--people have just lost their homes--right now we do not have near the direct grant assistance we need, and some of the loan programs just will not help them get back on their feet. All of us are working very hard on this. This is truly an example of there but for the grace of God go I. 
Every time there has ever been a disaster relief bill come to the floor of the Senate, I have never hesitated to support it because I always know that this could happen to anybody. 
Nobody in South Dakota or North Dakota or Minnesota asked for this. People did not ask for their towns to be under water, did not ask to lose their homes, did not ask to be refugees, and did not ask to have their small businesses wiped out. If there is ever a role for Government, it is to try to help people that really need help. 
Mr. President, I just urge all of my colleagues, please, help us out, Democrats and Republicans alike. Please let us do well for the people in our States. This is something that I think really, truly should and must unite all of us together. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. 
Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention goes into force April 29 with or without U.S. participation. This, after more than 100 years of international efforts to ban chemical weapons, including the Hague Convention of 1889 and the Geneva Protocol of 1925 which placed restrictions on the use of chemical weapons. The history of chemical weapons use is a long one--from 1915 with the German use of chlorine gas in Belgium during World War I, to the Iraqi use of poison gas to kill an estimated 4,000 people in the Kurdish village of Halabja in 1988, and the very recent threat of chemical weapons use in the Persian Gulf war. 
These chemical weapons are dangerous--not only because of intentional, but also accidental use. In Minnesota, I've listened to many gulf war veterans who've told me about their experiences during the conflict. Much is still unknown about chemical weapons use in the gulf and there is great concern throughout the Minnesota veterans community. I've seen the tragic effects of this when I've met with gulf war veterans who went to the gulf in perfect health but became seriously ill after they returned. While many are uncertain about the causes of their illnesses, they suspect that exposure to toxic chemical agents was a factor. 
Mr. President, I want to tell my colleagues about a story I recently heard concerning veterans who were part of the 477th Ambulance Company who may have been exposed to toxic chemicals. After the war, a couple of company members went exploring the area nearby and noticed a spill on the floor of a warehouse. There's no way of knowing now exactly what the substance was, but they are concerned about possible exposure to a nerve agent. They were alarmed because even this kind of low-level exposure can be a serious threat to our soldiers' safety and health. The plea from the Minnesotan who told this story is, `Please! Get everyone to stop using this junk!' Well, that is exactly what we are trying to do, and ratifying the CWC is a vital step in that direction. If we don't sign up, America's soldiers--and indeed, all Americans--will be the worse for it. 
Another Minnesotan who was a nuclear-biological-chemical warfare specialist during the war talked about the panic and incorrect use of protective equipment that occurred when there were scud alerts accompanied by CBW alerts. There were soldiers who just couldn't handle the threat of possible chemical attacks. And why should we be surprised? The use of chemical weapons is inhuman and even the perceived threat has to be psychologically damaging. These stories just strengthen my resolve to do all I can to push for ratification of this treaty. 
Mr. President, we face a decision between taking a lead role in this effort or standing on the sidelines--this decision should 
not be difficult for the United States which historically has taken the lead in arms control, seeking agreements that are in the national interest, verifiable, and contribute to world peace. I repeat in the national interest, verifiable, and contribute to world peace. And there is no question in my mind that the CWC fully meets these standards. 
To me, it is a great mystery why this treaty is not already ratified. After all, Congress directed in 1985 that all U.S. chemical munitions be destroyed by 1999--since amended to 2004. Subsequently in 1993, the United States became one of the original signatories of the CWC, now awaiting ratification by this body. It would seem that there's nothing so dramatic as waiting until the last minute to make an obvious and sensible decision. This international treaty takes a major step forward in the elimination of the scourge of chemical weapons. As the world's only superpower and leader in the fight for world peace, we must be out front on this convention. 
This treaty itself has a very interesting and solid bipartisan history as well as strong popular support, and I am mystified as to why some of my colleagues want to reject a treaty for which we are largely responsible. The CWC was conceived during the Reagan administration, crafted and signed during the Bush administration and further negotiated during the Clinton administration. Former President Bush has continued to proclaim strong support for ratification. Its bipartisan creditials are thus impeccable. Legislators and national security experts from both parties firmly support it. Former Secretary of State James Baker argues that it is outrageous to suggest that either Presidents Bush or Reagan would negotiate a treaty that would harm national security. President Clinton sees the accord as building on the treaty than bans nuclear tests in the atmosphere that President Kennedy signed more than three decades ago. The Senate now needs to complete the weapons-control work to which Presidents Kennedy, Reagan and Bush and Clinton were and have been committed. 
By at least restricting the manufacture, sale, and possession of toxic chemicals capable of being used as weapons, the United States makes it more difficult for rogue nations or terrorist organizations to obtain the raw material for weapons. Ultimately, we then better protect our soldiers and civilians. We should help lead the world away from these graveyard gases, and not pretend they are essential to a solid defense. Do we plan to use chemical weapons? No. Then do we lack the courage to lead? I certainly hope not. 
Mr. President, according to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the United States is the only nation with the power, influence, and respect to forge a strong global consensus against the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
There is also support for this treaty from the armed services. I have the unique perspective of serving on both the Foreign 
Relations Committee and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I know that many veterans organizations support this treaty--VFW, VVA, Reserve Officers Association of U.S., American Ex-prisoners of War, AMVETS, Jewish War Vets to name a few. What better testimony to its value? The treaty will reduce world stockpiles of weapons and will hopefully prevent our troops from being exposed to poison gases. And, for my colleagues who are still not convinced on the merits of the treaty--over three quarters of the American public--as much as 84 percent in a recent poll, favors this treaty. 
But why then are there opponents to this treaty? I cannot answer that. I can only say that it is always easier to tear something down than it is to build it. Ask ethnic minorities in Iraq--who were the victims of Saddam's chemical attacks--why there are opponents. Ask Generals Schwartzkopf and Powell why there are opponents. According to General Powell, this treaty serves our national interest--to quote his comments at last week's Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing: `For us to reject that treaty now because there are rogue nations outside the treaty is the equivalent of saying we shouldn't have joined NATO because Russia wasn't a part of NATO.' If we don't sign this treaty, their will still be rogue nations. Ask the State Department, the intelligence community, the chemical manufacturers who stand to lose as much as $600 million in sales, why there are opponents to this treaty. And ask our own gulf war veterans who lived with the fear of chemical attack and may now be suffering the effects of exposure to chemicals why there are opponents. They and I will never understand it. 
Mr. President, ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is crucial to all nonproliferation efforts. If America's message to the world is that the United States is not deeply concerned about the production of weapons of mass destruction, then it will encourage rogue states to either continue clandestine projects or to begin producing these weapons that could imperil U.S. troops in future conflicts. Lack of U.S. resolve on the CWC and the unraveling effect it would have on other arms control treaties, would make it easier for rogue states in two ways: they could more easily acquire chemical weapons materials and more effectively hide their production programs. How can we best protect the future of our children, our soldiers, our trade, our country's position in the world? By ratifying this treaty. 
I'm deeply puzzled as to why, when at long last the Senate is on the verge of giving its advice and consent to CWC ratification, we are being asked to consider treaty-killer conditions. Again, I remind my colleague, this treaty has been more than 15 years in the making with two Republican Presidents and one Democratic President involved in negotiating and crafting the final product. It is the result of years of bipartisan efforts. The CWC has been strongly endorsed by former Secretary of State James Baker and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft--both of whom served Republican Presidents. It also enjoys the support of 
our top commanders during the Persian Gulf war, including General Schwarzkopf, who clearly recognize that it is in our national interest to ratify the treaty. 
While I do not question the motives and integrity of my colleagues who support these four killer conditions, it is clear that they are not a result of insufficient Senate scrutiny and debate. In fact, the CWC has been before the Senate since November 1993, when it was submitted by President Clinton. During the past 3 1/2 years, the Senate has held 17 hearings on the treaty and the administration has provided the Senate with more than 1,500 pages of information on the CWC, including over 300 pages of testimony and over 400 pages of answers to questions for the record. It is important to recall that in April 1996 the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations voted the treaty out of committee by a strong bipartisan majority, 13 to 5. Why then, only 1 year later, are we confronting four conditions, any of which will prevent us from ratifying the treaty by April 29 when it will automatically go into effect, and a fifth condition that is unacceptable and would undermine the treaty? 
Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues realize that the United States will incur serious costs if we don't submit instruments of ratification by April 29. Unless we join the convention now, the United States will be barred from having a seat on the executive council, the key decisionmaking body of the convention, for at least a year and, perhaps, longer. We would thus be precluded from influencing vital decisions to be made by the executive council regarding the detailed procedures that will be followed under the convention. Moreover, sanctions against U.S. companies--the requirement that they obtain end-user certificates to export certain chemicals--will commence on April 29 if we are not a convention party. If we still haven't joined in 3 years, U.S. firms would be subject to a ban on trade in certain chemicals. In addition, U.S. citizens won't be hired as officials or inspectors by the body that will implement the convention until the United States becomes a party to the CWC. And, even more important than these costs to the United States, is the fact that failure to ratify the treaty, which was produced because of U.S. leadership, will have a negative impact on American leadership around the world. 
While I will never understand why we have come to such a pass, it is crystal clear to me why we have to move to strike all five of these conditions. Mr. President, permit me to briefly summarize each of the five conditions and to spell out the key reasons why I'm unalterably opposed to them: 
CWC condition No. 29 on Russia precludes the United States from joining the convention until Russia ratifies and satisfies other specified conditions. This is a killer condition that would hold hostage our ability to join the CWC to hardliners in the Russian Duma. As the President put it, `this is precisely backwards [since] the 
best way to secure Russian ratification is to ratify the treaty ourselves.' I couldn't agree more with the President, whose position parallels that of Vil Myrzyanov, a Russian scientist who blew the whistle on the Soviet Union's CW program and strongly backs the treaty. In a recent letter to my distinguished colleague, Senator Lugar, he said `Senate ratification of the convention is crucial to securing action on the treaty in Moscow.' Unless, my colleagues join me in striking this amendment, we'll be permitting Russian hardliners to decide our foreign policy, while dimming prospects that Russia--which has the world's largest stockpile of chemical weapons--will ratify the CWC. How can this be in our national interest? 
CWC condition No. 30 on rogue states bars the United States from ratifying the CWC until all states determined to possess offensive chemical weapons programs, including China, North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, and Iraq, and other states deemed to be state sponsors of terrorism, have ratified. This is a killer condition likely to prevent the United States from ever joining the CWC. If this condition is not struck we would be using the lowest common denominator as a principle for determining our foreign policy. The United States would be placed in the bizarre and embarrassing position of allowing the world's most recalcitrant regimes to determine when we join the CWC, if ever. As former Secretary of State James Baker has said: `It makes no sense to argue that because a few pariah states refuse to join the convention the United States should line up with them rather than the rest of the world.' Makes no sense at all, which is precisely why I strongly support striking this condition. 
CWC condition No. 31 on barring CWC inspectors from a number of countries such as Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, from ever entering the United States as part of CWC inspection teams. This is an unnecessary condition that has the potential to seriously hamstring CWC implementation. To begin with, the United States already has the right under the CWC to bar inspectors on an individual basis each year when the CWC proposes its list of inspectors. If this condition is not struck, it is likely to provoke reciprocity, resulting in other nations blackballing all American inspectors. This would have the perverse effect of undermining one of our main objectives in joining the treaty: to ensure American inspectors take the lead in finding violations. In addition, condition No. 31 would bar inspectors from a country like China even if United States national security might be better served by letting them confirm directly that the United States is not violating the CWC, but fails to require rejection of inspectors from other countries who might be known spies or have a record of improper handling of confidential data. Because of these serious flaws, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to strike this condition. 
CWC condition No. 32 which prohibits the United States from joining the CWC until the President certifies that the parties to the convention have agreed to strike article X and amend article XI. This provision is an outright killer that will prevent the United States from 
joining the Convention. Clearly the President can't make such a certification prior to April, and likely won't ever be able to do so since the Convention permits a single State party to veto such amendments. Proponents of condition No. 32 wrongly contend that the Convention requires the United States and other parties to share sensitive technology that will assist such countries as Iran to develop offensive CW capabilities. 
In fact, Mr. President, neither article X nor article XI have such requirements. Article X, which focuses mainly on assisting or protecting convention member countries attacked, or facing attack, by chemical weapons, provides complete flexibility for states to determine what type of assistance to provide and how to provide it. One option would be to provide solely medical antidotes and treatments to the threatened state. This is precisely the option the President has chosen under agreed condition No. 15 which specifies that the United States will give only medical help to such countries as Iran or Cuba under article X. Moreover, beyond medical assistance, the President has made clear the United States will be careful in deciding what assistance to provide on a case-by-case basis. In sum, there is no valid justification for scrapping article X. 
Opponents of the CWC contend that article XI, which addresses the exchange of scientific and technical information, requires the sharing of technology and will result in the erosion of export controls now imposed by the Australia Group of chemical exporting countries, which includes the United States. While this is plainly not the case, the President under agreed condition No. 7 is committed to obtain assurances from our Australia Group partners that article XI is fully consistent with maintaining export curbs on dangerous chemicals. Condition No. 7 also requires the President to certify that the CWC doesn't obligate the United States to modify its national export controls, as well as to certify annually that the Australia Group is maintaining controls that are equal to, or exceed, current export controls. 
Mr. President, one final point regarding the Condition's proponents concern that articles X and XI will require 
technology that will assist other countries to develop offensive chemical weapons programs. Exchanges of sensitive technology and information provided under terms of both articles would be legally bound by the fundamental obligation of treaty article I, which obligates parties never to `* * * assist encourage, or induce, in any, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State party under this convention.' This would ban assisting anyone in acquiring a chemical weapons capability. 
I strongly urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in voting to strike this condition. 
CWC condition No. 33 would prohibit the United States from ratifying the CWC until the President can certify high confidence U.S. capabilities to detect within 1 year of a violation, the illicit production or storage of one metric ton of chemical agent. Since this is an unachievable standard for monitoring the treaty, this is a killer condition that would permanently bar U.S. participation in the CWC. 
Mr. President, no one can deny that some aspects of the CWC will be difficult to verify, nor can anyone affirm that any arms control agreement is 100 percent verifiable. And, as Gen. Edward Rowny, who was special adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush, pointed out in the Washington Post any chemical weapons treaty is inherently more difficult to verify than a strategic arms treaty, under which missiles and bombers can be observed by national technical means. For one thing, chemical weapons can literally be produced in thousands of large and small laboratories around the world. But the bottom line is one made succinctly and clearly by General Rowny: `If we are within the CWC, well-trained and experienced American inspectors, employing an agreed set of procedures, intensive procedures, will have an opportunity to catch violaters. Outside the CWC, no such opportunity will exist.' I couldn't agree more. As in many other matters, the perfect is not only unattainable but is also the enemy of the good. I hope than many of my colleagues will see this issue in the same light and will join me in voting to strike condition No. 33. 
In conclusion, I want to stress that America has always been a leader in international arms negotiations. America should continue this proud tradition of leading the way. We as a nation have the opportunity to be one of the world's leading guardians of the peace through the application of this treaty; we can participate in safeguarding our armed forces, our citizens, our children from the horrors of chemical weapons; we can lessen the likelihood of chemical weapons being used again in warfare. 
But to make all this possible, we must have the perspicacity and foresight to grab this fleeting opportunity, this historic moment where we decide to join with other nations to improve the quality of life worldwide and assure a safer, saner world. We have just celebrated Earth Day--and I ask what better way to honor our planet is there than by now ratifying a treaty that will protect and safeguard her people? 
Mr. President, there is not a lot of time to go through such an important issue, but I thought I would just draw from some very poignant and personal discussion back in Minnesota that we have had with gulf war veterans. 
To quote one of the veterans who himself is really struggling with illness which he thinks is based upon some exposure to chemicals during his service in the war, he said, `This is my plea. Please get everyone to stop using this junk.' 
I really do think that the more I talk to veterans with their service in the gulf war fresh in their mind, many of whom are ill, many of whom are struggling with illness, who were fine before they served in the war and are not now and want to know what has happened to them, there are two different issues. I have the honor of being on both the Veterans' Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. One, on the Veterans' Committee, is to get to the bottom of this and make sure veterans get the care they deserve. But the other is when we have such an important treaty, such a historically important agreement which is in the national interest, which is verifiable and which contributes to world peace and helps us get rid of this junk and is so important not only to our soldiers-to-be but also to children and grandchildren, Mr. President, I do not think there is any more important vote that we can make than one of majority support for the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
In my State of Minnesota, I know that people are overwhelmingly for this agreement. People are under no illusion. They do not think it is perfect, but they think it is an enormous step forward for all of humankind, an enormous step forward for people in our country, an enormous step forward for people in other countries as well. Since the United States of America has taken a leadership position in the international community, in the international arena, it would be, I think, nothing short of tragic if we now were on the sidelines, if we were not involved in the implementation of this agreement, if we were not involved in exerting our leadership in behalf of this agreement. 
I urge full support for this agreement, and I really do think I speak for a large, engaged majority in Minnesota. 
I thank the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I am going to in a short period of time offer two amendments which I hope will be really noncontroversial. I just would like to talk about both of them in general terms and then I will come back in time to offer these amendments. 
One of these amendments has to do with what I think is, unfortunately, very germane and it has to do with our failure still to provide the kind of mental health services, the kind of mental health coverage that is so direly needed. I know my colleagues have said one of the things that concerns them and concerns others is that all too often some of the people who take their lives are people in a severe state of depression, people who have not been treated. And then, of course, you really wonder whether or not this ever should have happened and this is the last thing you would like to see assisted. 
So I really feel that if, in fact, we are saying we do not want to see this kind of assisted, physician-assisted suicide, or people taking their lives, that is to say, then I think we really want to make sure we do not get to the point where some people, some who really want to take their lives are taking their lives not even necessarily because they are in terrible pain with a terrible illness but having more to do with a terrible mental illness. This is an amendment we will come to in a little while. 
The first amendment that I will offer shortly is an amendment which says it is the sense of the Senate that the Senate supports firm but fair work requirements for low-income unemployed individuals. I do not think my colleagues would disagree with that. And low-income workers who are jobless but are unable to find a job should look for work, they should participate in workfare or job training programs but they should not be denied food stamps without these opportunities. 
Again, I am just waiting for response from a couple other Senators before I introduce these amendments, but just in very broad outline the why of this amendment. 
I am going to draw from a study which comes out from the Department of Agriculture February 13, 1997, which really points to the characteristics of childless unemployed adult food stamp and legal immigrant food stamp participants. 
Madam President, this is not a pretty picture. We are talking about the poorest of poor people. If we are going to have vehicles out in the Chamber and there is going to be an opportunity--and these are just sense-of-the-Senate amendments--to really try and get the Senate on record to correct some problems that have to be corrected, then I want to take full advantage of it. In this particular case, we are talking about people who are very poor, many of them women, many of them minorities. 
What we are saying is, yes, work, but if there is not a workfare program available and someone cannot find a job, then do not cut people off food stamp assistance, do not say that in a 3-year period you can only get 3 months' worth of food stamp assistance. 
Why in the world would we want to create the very situation we are now creating which is you are basically taking the most vulnerable citizens, the poorest of poor people and you are putting them in a situation where they want to work, they cannot find a job, there is not a workfare program available, there is not a job training program available, they are suffering, struggling with HIV infection or dying from AIDS, they are struggling with mental illness, they did not even have a high school education, there are no opportunities for the training, and we are now saying that we 
are going to cut you off food stamp assistance. This was the harshest provision of the welfare bill that we passed. 
And so, Madam President, I come to the floor, and I will in a moment suggest the absence of a quorum just for a moment and then we will move forward with both of these amendments. But I come to the floor to introduce both of these amendments. These are sense-of-the-Senate amendments. I hope they will command widespread support. I say to my colleagues I am really hopeful for a very strong vote. I know they are anxious to have the bill come through. I do not think these amendments--I made them sense-of-the-Senate amendments. I think the language is very reasonable, and I do not mean to hold up the legislation at all, but on the other hand I do mean to get some attention focused on some areas that we really need to address. 
Madam President, just for a moment, I would suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I came to the floor of the Senate today to try to make sure that we make a commitment, albeit a preliminary commitment. I will read the operative language. `* * * take steps to ensure that elderly and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to work, will not be left without Federal assistance essential to their well-being.' 
I believe that, `It is the sense of the Senate that elderly and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to work should receive assistance essential to their well-being, and that the President, Congress, the States, and faith-based and other organizations should continue to work together toward that end,' is in the same spirit. 
We are going to have to define this with concrete language and with a decision made about investment of resources. I think it is an important step forward. I thank my colleague from Alaska. I would be pleased if we could have a voice vote if that is what my colleague wants to do.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I wanted to call the attention of my colleagues and the people in the country to what I think is an important gathering here in the Nation's Capital. It is a gathering which focuses on the elimination of assistance for legal immigrants. The sponsors of this gathering have done over the years a great deal of work with the Soviet Jewry, and I guess we can now say Russia and other republics. And, of course, they are concerned about legal immigrants--Jews that have come from Russia or the other new republics, many of whom are elderly, many of whom have meager resources, and many of whom now as a result of action taken last Congress in the welfare bill will be without supplementary security income assistance and will be without food nutrition assistance. 
What is important about this gathering, this rally, that is now taking place is that the sponsors have made it very clear that they don't want to focus just on Jews who have come to our country or who have fled persecution, but really on legal immigrants across the board from many different nations. The message of this rally, I think, is that we are a nation of proud immigrants. We are talking about many of our parents and many of our grandparents. In my case we are talking about my father who fled persecution from Russia. It really is shameful what we did, which I think was an overreach, which I hope we will rectify this Congress--I think we must--which is that we eliminated assistance to many people. As Mayor Giuliani said, by definition people who are receiving supplementary security income assistance or food nutrition assistance because they are so low income and poor really need this help. So what we are now faced with is a situation in our country where over 500,000 legal immigrants are going to be cut off supplementary security income and over 1 million are going to be cut off from any food stamp assistance. In the State of Minnesota about 35,000 legal immigrants are going to be cut off SSI and about 15,000 off food stamps. 
This rally is the first of many gatherings. I think we are going to see it all across the country, and it is going to be a combination of people who are scared to death. They are elderly, they are disabled, they can't work, and really all of the assistance is going to be cut off. The question is, What happens to them? The religious community is involved. Our county organizations are involved. Mayors are involved. Many Governors are now getting involved. 
I want to say to colleagues that as a matter of what is right, as a matter of elementary justice, as a matter of compassion, as a matter of considering our own tradition, our own roots, our own heritage, we have to restore this funding. It is simply unconscionable. It really is shameful what we did last Congress. I hope that we will make this a huge priority when we go forward with our budget. Otherwise, we are going to see a lot of vulnerable people who came to our country, who have worked, who have paid their taxes, who were legal immigrants, who maybe have an income total of $525 a month, and they are going to see almost all of that assistance eliminated. The question becomes, What happens to these people? That is the question I have for my colleagues. What happens to these people? Are we willing to be so generous with the suffering of others? I don't think we can just insulate ourselves here and act as if this isn't happening around the country. 
People have now received letters that have notified them 
that they are going to be cut off; that this assistance which has been a lifeline of assistance is going to be eliminated. 
I will tell you something. In my adult life--and this is not an exaggeration--I don't think I have ever seen people so frightened. I have never met with a group of citizens nor have I have ever met with a group of people who are more frightened. I have never seen such fear in the faces of people. I cannot believe that we don't have enough goodness inside of us, enough compassion here to really fix this problem, change the course, and make sure that we provide some assistance to many people in our country who deserve our assistance.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me start out by giving some context to this amendment. I feel strongly that the Federal Government should live up to its obligation to take possession of nuclear waste. That is my framework. I am with this amendment not operating outside of that framework. 
I also add that Minnesotans and other customers of nuclear power have been paying into a nuclear waste fund over the years, and the reason was and the understanding is that the Federal Government would make this commitment and live up to this commitment. That part of this legislation, that premise, I fully support. 
Mr. President, I have been concerned in the past--and still am although I don't have an amendment today that deals with this--about what happens when the Federal Government actually takes title under this bill because I do think that over the years you are going to have a huge taxpayer liability. So while I want the Federal Government to be responsible and live up to its national commitment to do something about it, I worry about the transfer of over 10,000 years all of a sudden to the taxpayers. The GAO has estimated that the taxpayers' future burden could be about $77 billion. This is assuming a 100-year program. But we are talking about a program of nuclear waste that is over thousands of years. 
Mr. President, concerns about this legislation. First of all, the legislation still attempts to skirt some of the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. There is a reason for that piece of legislation, and I do think, when you are talking about the transport of highly radioactive nuclear waste material, this is a time, if there ever was a time, when you want to have full environmental review, when you want to be absolutely certain that you are talking about the transportation of this kind of material taking into full account the health and safety and protection of families all across the country. 
My esteemed colleagues from Nevada have discussed some of the risks and problems associated with transporting highly radioactive nuclear waste in their struggle against this bill. They also feel that Nevada has been unfairly singled out, and I respect them for that. My framework is a little different. But I do want to point out there are going to be some 16,000 shipments on our highways and our railways over the coming years. We are talking about some significant distance traveled. There are legitimate concerns that people have about the transportation of this highly radioactive nuclear waste material; people are going to be concerned about it, and in addition there is some debate about whether or not the containers themselves are safe. 
We already transport hazardous materials, but I want to argue there is a significant difference when we are talking about nuclear waste material, especially highly radioactive nuclear waste. Consider it this way. If you have an accident involving nuclear waste as opposed to many hazardous wastes, you can have a dramatically different outcome. Radiation, without doubt, kills people, and it is a different scale we are talking about. God forbid--worst case scenario--we have an accident. We have to do everything we can to guard against that accident. We could be talking about something catastrophic. We cannot afford to have such an accident in our country which results in this kind of radiation leak that could have such dire consequences for people, such dire consequences for our families, and therefore I think we have to do everything possible to assure safety. That is what this amendment is about. 
Now, this bill calls for a transportation planning process, and I note--and I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska--that part of the amendment I proposed last week calling for more public participation has been incorporated. That is to say, there is some language about public comment when it comes to these plans. But in Minnesota we currently have 641 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. That is a conservative estimate. And by the year 2014 we expect there will be around 987 metric tons, all of which will travel the roads and rails of Minnesota and States between us and Nevada, if this bill succeeds. So I think we have to do everything possible to ensure the safety and security of these shipments, and I would add that I think to talk about public comment really does not go far enough. 
Initially, our amendment said that in the actual planning process, as you chart out the routes, those citizens who are affected by the transportation of this material ought to be able to be involved in the planning process, as should local officials. They should at least be consulted. I did not say they would have a veto because I know that would not work. But I did talk about consultation. I did talk about involving citizens who will be affected, who are going to be worried about themselves and their families, and local officials who are going to be worried, I talked about involving them in a more integral and real and substantive way in the planning process. I wish that amendment had been accepted. 
My friends from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, and from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, have made sure that this legislation really does take some steps forward from the last bill. Grants can be provided for training, and in addition there are going to be training standards which are going to be set. I still think, again, that we have to do everything possible to ensure the safety of these shipments. We have to do everything possible, leave no stone unturned, in making sure that we prevent the worst case scenario, which could be a nightmare scenario for our country. If we do not do that, we are going to be asking ourselves, when such an accident takes place, did we do everything possible when we transported this poisonous waste all across America. 
The brave men and women who are likely to be first on the scene when an accident occurs, local firefighters, do not support this bill because they believe it inadequately provides for their needs such as the training, funding, and technical assistance.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, what the firefighters are saying is, look, you are going to have $150,000 which is going to be offered by each State that is to be affected by this along this transportation route but the question we are asking, says the firefighters, is how do we know that in 2 years or 5 years we are going to be ready? We want to make sure there is enough funding for our training, and we want to make sure we are adequately prepared for this because it is our responsibility to protect the citizens in our communities. 
I am told that the International Association of Firefighters, which represents 95 percent of professional firefighters in the United States, did a survey of departments along a potential test shipping route in Ohio, and they found that 40 percent of the departments along the route were not prepared, according to current standards, to deal with hazardous material accidents. Let us face it. When it comes to hazardous material and when it comes to highly radioactive nuclear waste, we are going to try, whether it be by rail or road, to go in the less populated of our rural areas. And by the way, all too often, people in rural America are familiar with the saying let's go where fewer people live, but they say there may be fewer of us but we count as much as anybody living in any metropolitan area. 
We are also hearing from a lot of communities: We are worried that we are not going to be trained; we don't feel we are even ready when it comes to the transportation of hazardous materials. 
So, Mr. President, let us assume the grants have been made and a State takes advantage of these funds. Two years pass and shipments of nuclear waste begin to pass through the State. What guarantee do we have that local fire departments are fully trained and equipped and that if the worst thing possible happens, they can respond in such a way as to minimize disaster. 
What this amendment says is that the Department of Energy must determine--in other words, we talked about training. We have talked about some grants, but nowhere in this piece of legislation do we have the fail-safe, ironclad guarantee that as a matter of fact these local fire departments, these local emergency response personnel will have received adequate training. This amendment proposes that the Department of Energy must determine that emergency response personnel along the routes where over 16,000 shipments of highly radioactive waste will pass have met an acceptable standard of training before these shipments begin. That is all this amendment says. 
Again, what we want to do is to verify that these brave men and women--they are asking this. They are going to be on the frontline, the first line of response to an accident, people who are going to be putting their lives on the line--in fact have received the training they need. This amendment says that no shipments will occur until the Department of Energy has determined that the emergency response personnel in all jurisdictions along a given shipping route will have met an acceptable level of training. It seems to me that is very reasonable. I think this is a logical extension of the Wyden amendment in committee. 
Yes, we have some funding, although we do not know whether it is going to be enough. Most communities do not think it is. Yes, we have some training standards. But what we are saying is we have to make sure, above and beyond some funding and some standards for acceptable levels of training, that level of training is met before any deadly cargo under this bill hits the road. In other words, no training, no shipments. That is a pretty reasonable amendment. 
This bill in its current form calls for training standards to be established by the Department of Transportation, but I am concerned that the bill is ambiguous at best about who is really responsible for making sure these standards are met. That is what this amendment speaks to. By requiring the Secretary of the Department of Energy to determine that every jurisdiction has met the standards, this amendment holds the processor of the waste responsible for making sure all safety precautions have been taken. 
If requiring a determination by the DOE just simply adds one additional signoff to this process, then I say this makes all the sense in the world. 
One more time. What we have is a situation where we are going to be talking about the shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste. This is of a different order than hazardous material. We have the firefighters and other people who are concerned about this living in the local communities saying we are worried about whether or not we are going to receive adequate funding for training and whether or not we are in fact going to be trained. 
There is some funding. I do not think it is going to be enough. We do not want this to become an unfunded mandate. And there is some setting of the level of standards by the Department of Transportation but nowhere in this legislation do we have a clear line of accountability that as a matter of fact firefighters and other local safety personnel will be trained to deal with a crisis if they have to do so. 
It seems to me that the very least we can do is to make sure that happens. 
Let me simply conclude by quoting the last part of this letter from the International Association of Firefighters:  
Put quite simply, America's emergency responders are not equipped to deal with an incident along the routes to the Yucca Mountain facility. If an incident were to occur, whether it is an accident or terrorist act, lives would be unnecessarily lost because the local emergency response personnel lack the necessary training and equipment to effectively respond. 
All this amendment does is say let us make sure, Department of Energy, you are accountable; you have to make a determination that before we ship this waste, the local fire departments, the local safety personnel have, in fact, received the training and they are equipped to deal with, if, God forbid, there is, a serious accident. I believe this amendment should be accepted. It is imminently reasonable, and it seems to me we ought to take every step necessary to make sure we guarantee the safety and security of people in our communities. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

We want to make sure, in fact, those standards have been met. 
I would like to thank the National Association of Firefighters and the firefighters of Minnesota. What they have said is, `Look, we want to make sure you have some kind of process, some kind of fail-safe mechanism to make sure we are adequately trained to deal with this disaster.' That is what this amendment does. It holds someone accountable--the Department of Energy. It says the Department of Energy is going to make a preliminary determination, whatever the operative language is, that, in fact, before we have the actual transportation of this highly radioactive nuclear waste material, that the local personnel, firefighters, and others, are ready, trained and equipped to deal with an emergency if they have to do so.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me start off by reading a March 19, 1997, article in the New York Times about Luz Gross, 88 years old, a widow who resides in New York City. She is from the Dominican Republic and is suffering from severe Alzheimer's. 
When asked when she was born, Mrs. Gross says, `When I came to the United States, I wasn't born.' Asked if she wanted to become a citizen, she began talking about her childhood when she lived close to the sea in Santo Domingo. 
Mrs. Gross' only child Felix is 72 himself, retired and living on $10,320 a year from Social Security and a small union pension earned after working 18 years as a building handyman in Manhattan. He visits his mother every day repairing whatever breaks in her apartment and watching television with her. But he said he cannot afford to support her, and there is no room for her to live in his small one-bedroom apartment. `I feel in denial,' he said. `I can't believe this is happening.' 
Mr. President, Nouphanh is 65 years old, and she has been in the United States since 1984. Before she left Laos, she had no access to education because her parents moved from place to place to get away from the war. She does not understand English and has no family here. She is alone. She is on disability income, $484 a month, and she lives in a housing project. She is severely depressed and currently undergoing treatment. She says, `Sometimes in this country I feel like I am deaf, I am blind, I am mute, because I cannot learn English.' Every day she lives in fear, and every day she asks herself what will happen to her if she does not have SSI and food stamps. 
Mr. President, let me, one more time, bring to the attention of my colleagues this amendment. I am hoping for a good, strong, positive vote. It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should take steps to ensure that elderly and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to work will not be left without Federal assistance essential to their well-being. 
Mr. President, I said it earlier before my colleague arrived. The reason that I bring this sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the floor of the U.S. Senate today is because I think we are confronted with the fierce urgency of now--Arizona being one good example of one State in the country--we have all heard from legal immigrants and we have all heard from 80-year-old women living alone, and partially disabled. They have received letters. They are now, as a result of the legislation we passed last year, going to be cut off assistance. They are terrified. They live in fear. 
I said earlier, and I am not being melodramatic, I was a community organizer for 20 years before I was fortunate enough to become a U.S. Senator from Minnesota. I have worked with lots of people who have been struggling with lots of different issues, many of them very poor, and I have never in my whole life seen people 
with such fear in their faces. I have never seen people so terrified. 
Mr. President, what in God's name does eliminating supplemental security income and food nutrition assistance for an 80-year-old Hmong woman, partially disabled, living alone in Minnesota have to do with reform? It is not reform. It is unconscionable. It is shameful. 
Mr. President, I said earlier I am going to have a chance to speak at a rally this afternoon, going on right now, organized by groups and organizations that have worked with Soviet Jewry over the years. I am the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution in Russia. Maybe that is why I feel so strongly about this. But, Mr. President, it is not just Jewish immigrants from Russia or Eastern Europe; it is legal immigrants, people who have come to our country, many of whom have worked and paid taxes. 
There have been reports by the Urban Institute and others that show that these legal immigrants have given much more to our country in taxes than any benefit that they have ever received. 
Mr. President, last Congress we passed a piece of legislation, all in the name of deficit reduction, that eliminated $22 billion worth of assistance to these vulnerable citizens. Mr. President, it was easy to do. They are among the most vulnerable citizens in this country with the least amount of political power and, therefore, we chose to make the cuts there. 
But, Mr. President, I think there is goodness--I am sorry--in my colleagues. I think we did not realize what we were doing. That happens often. I have voted for legislation for which I did not fully understand all of the consequences, and later on I changed my mind. Please, let us change our minds. 
We are hearing from our Governors, Mr. President. We are hearing from our mayors. We are hearing from our county officials. They are all saying, `Wait a minute. These people, by definition, on supplemental security income are not going to make it to self-sufficiency.' By definition we are talking about people who are either very elderly or people who are disabled and people who need the support. 
Mr. President, at one of many community meetings I attended in Minnesota there was a man who came up to me who was a Hmong. He fought on our side during the Vietnam war. He has--I know this is hard to believe; but it is true--he has one bullet still in his brain and one bullet still in his knee. He is disabled. We are going to eliminate his supplemental security income assistance. What does that have to do with reform? 
Mr. President, I was at a gathering on the west side of St. Paul. I will never forget it. It sent chills down my spine. A woman came up to me. I thought that she was 80. She was bent over. Certainly she looked every bit 80 years of age. She came up to me, and her hands were shaking, and she began to wail. That was the kind of crying that she was doing. She began to wail. And she had in her hands a picture of her husband, and then I realized he was my age and, therefore, she was probably about my age. Her husband fought in the Vietnam war. 
Again, she was a Hmong who came over to our country. We have a large Hmong community in Minnesota. Her husband apparently had just passed away about a month earlier. 
Mr. President, this woman is not going to learn our language. She is not going to become a citizen. But these people fought the war in Indochina. They came to our country. We made a commitment that there would be some assistance for them. She has nowhere to go. She has nowhere to go. 
What I hated about that community meeting, and what I hate about all of these meetings, is that I keep thinking to myself, people really think that as a Senator from Minnesota I can change this. It scares me, because I am afraid we will not do anything at all. 
Mr. President, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment is an amendment that I think all of my colleagues can vote for. It does not specify a course of action that we should take. But it at 
least gives the religious community, all of the legal immigrants, and many local officials who feel like we are dumping the cost on them some assurances. Much less it gives us some reassurance that we have rediscovered part of our soul again if we would at least go on record saying it is the sense of the Senate that Congress should take steps to ensure that elderly and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to work will not be left without Federal assistance essential to their well-being. 
Mr. President, I think it would be a very important statement for us to make. I think this is a very important position for us to take. We are heading into the budget negotiations. We are hearing from people in our States. We are hearing from people in the country. And that is why I come to the floor of the Senate. 
I told that Hmong woman, who was about 50 years of age, though she looked like she was going on 80--she has had such a difficult life, holding the picture of her husband, no longer alive, who served on our side during the war in Vietnam--I told her, through a translator, because she does not speak English, all these people who have come to these community meetings, that although I did not know whether I would win or not, I would come to the floor and fight for people. 
This is just the beginning of this effort. I am lucky to have a strong colleague, Luis Gutierrez, in the House who is pushing very hard. I am really hoping Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, will accept this amendment or will vote for this amendment. It is time that we correct this. 
We did the wrong thing, colleagues. You may not agree with me on all issues, and I know quite often you do not, but we did the wrong thing. These are people that we should not literally throw out in the cold. These are people who really need this assistance. These are some very good people. These are, for many of us, our parents or our grandparents. 
Mr. President, we have to do something. We have to take some corrective action, and this amendment, I think, is the beginning of our doing that. 
I yield the floor. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the President has now declared a major disaster in my home State, Minnesota, and ordered Federal aid to supplement State and local recovery efforts in areas hard hit by severe flooding, severe winter storms, snow melt, high winds, rain and ice. And this all continues. The declaration will make funds available for grants, disaster housing and low-interest loans to cover uninsured damaged property and other aid to help residents, businesses and local governments cope with ongoing storm and flood damage. 
I am pleased by the swift action taken by the emergency management division of the Department of Public Safety in Minnesota. Jim Franklin and his hard-working staff, very hard-working staff are to be commended for their efforts. I am very pleased with the action taken by the Federal Government as well. 
I think James Lee Witt is one of the greatest employments ever made by any President. He has been so responsive to all of us in this country when citizens in our States are faced with these very difficult and painful crises. I do not think crisis is an exaggeration. 
I am also really pleased with the way in which SBA, the Small Business Administration, has been so responsive. 
Today, I will be requesting $50 million in additional energy assistance, the LIHEAP program, to help families who will soon be returning to their homes only to find their heating systems have been damaged. These are individuals with low income, many of them elderly, many of them families with children, who, because of the severe cold we have had all winter, have already had a very difficult time paying their heating bills. This aid is desperately needed. Many waterways in our State are already at record water levels. The Minnesota River is threatening to totally overrun many cities along its border. Record flood conditions are being predicted along the Red River, which is expected to crest within the next few days. 
Along the Red River there are still ice and snowpacks which will be melting in the coming days and weeks, further threatening communities already under siege in northwestern Minnesota, and flood conditions continue to build along the Mississippi River as well, cresting any day now. 
Some communities have already been hit and are under water and ice. In the town of Ada, nearly all the 1,000 residents have been forced to evacuate, including residents of a nursing home who had to be rescued by the National Guard. And, thank you, National Guard, for all of your fine work. Many of these people had little or no time to pack their belongings before fleeing. And when they return, little will likely be salvageable. 
In Appleton, ice floe broke through the levee, and the river now has surged 21.5 feet in one-half hour, forcing a massive volunteer effort to halt the flow of surging water and further prevent housing damage. The Pomme de Terre River--let me repeat that--has surged 21.5 feet in just one-half hour. 
The record flooding and cold temperatures have had a major impact on Minnesota. There have been widespread power outages throughout parts of the State, and with the flooding and the cold, emergency repair crews are unable to get to the affected areas. Many farmers are having trouble farming, and it is going to be a very, very difficult spring planting season. 
I am very pleased, again, that FEMA Director James Lee Witt has done so much and will be coming to Minnesota to see firsthand the devastation. I believe he will be coming to South Dakota and North Dakota as well. As a Senator from Minnesota, I express my sympathy to Senators from the Dakotas. Of course, we will all work together. 
I have been touched by the sense of community among many people in Minnesota. Many folks do not care who they are working next to as long as they are working for their communities. People are working tirelessly, around the clock, to hold back the river. Neighbors are standing shoulder to shoulder, sandbagging. Volunteers are tirelessly serving sandwiches and hot coffee at fire stations. 
When I was in Montevideo last week, it was just amazing. People who live on the high ground, they don't ever have to worry about the flood; they are out there, I mean really working to the point of exhaustion, sandbagging for others. High school students, I say to the pages, have volunteered their time, and they are doing a great job. That is the good news. The good news is the goodness of people in Minnesota. The good news is all the ways in which people are working together--I might add, to my colleagues, Democrats, Republicans, and others. The good news is the voluntarism of young people. The bad news is that in all too many communities, it really looks like a war zone. 
The weeks and months ahead will include many more hours of hard work, cleanup, removal of sandbags, restoration of buildings, and ensuring that water supplies are not contaminated. People need not only the support of their neighbors, they need the support that only the Federal Government can provide. 
It is interesting. Colleagues, Republicans and Democrats from other States, during the years I have been here in the Senate, have come to the floor and spoken about what citizens in their States have been confronted with. I think all of us are sympathetic and all of us try to provide the support. 
I thank President Clinton for his very prompt response. I thank my colleagues in advance for the support I know they will give. I thank colleagues who have come up to me in the last couple of days and have asked me, how are people doing? What can we do to help? I am really proud--it is not a politician speaking--I am just really proud of people in Minnesota. I wish people did not have to go through this. I am emotional about it. I am really emotional about it. I just wish this was not happening, but it is, and it is so important that all of us at the Federal level try to provide assistance to people in communities not just in Minnesota but around the country when they are faced with these kinds of disasters. This really is a disaster. 
I look forward to getting back home as soon as possible this weekend. I look forward to James Lee Witt and others coming to visit Minnesota, North and South Dakota, and other States that are going to need the help. People really need the help. People really need the help, and we have to make sure we 
provide it. 
I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Harold Edward Stassen who will be celebrating his 90th birthday on April 13, 1997. Harold Stassen has an outstanding record of public and military service to America. There is no question that his unique contributions have left a lasting impression on not only the history of his home State and his country, but at an international level as well. 
In 1938, at the age of 31, Harold Stassen was elected Governor of Minnesota and remained our Nation's youngest Governor until 1943. He then resigned to accept a commission in the U.S. Navy where he attained the rank of captain during World War II. He also won the Legion of Merit, three other decorations, and was awarded six major battle stars. Moreover, he was personally responsible for freeing thousands of American prisoners of war in Japan shortly before that country's surrender. 
Although Mr. Stassen also served as a key adviser in a variety of influential posts throughout the Eisenhower administration, he will be best remembered for his service under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At the President's personal request, Harold Stassen served on the American delegation to the 1945 San Francisco Conference that founded the United Nations. Indeed, he is now the only living American who drafted, negotiated, and signed the original U.N. Charter. Moreover, Mr. Stassen has maintained a dedicated, passionate interest in the U.N. since its founding--educating the American public about the United Nations, and striving to make the organization more effective. 
Harold Stassen is celebrating his 90th birthday just 2 years after we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. On April 13, numerous national and State officials, including former Vice President and United States Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, will come to St. Paul, MN, to honor Mr. Stassen. 
As Harold Stassen commemorates this significant milestone it is indeed an honor for me to join with his family, friends, and colleagues in conveying my warmest birthday wishes to this remarkable American and fellow Minnesotan who has such a proud and exceptional record of distinguished public service.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is time for attention to be given to Arnold Aronson. Few students in this country, when studying Civics in their high schools and elementary schools, learn of the name Aronson. When they read about the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988, and the Americans with Disability Act--each in their own right a high water mark for our Nation--they hear names like King, Kennedy, and Johnson--but not Aronson. 
This is a lamentable omission for two reasons. First of all, none of these landmark pieces of legislation would ever have happened if it hadn't been for him. Second, school children across the Nation should be taught about the vital role non-elected individuals have played in our society, and the indispensable role of grass roots efforts and coalition building--two pillars of our political structure exemplified by Arnie Aronson. Mr. President, this nation should understand that our landmark civil rights laws were born in our Nation's communities, not in the minds of our Presidents. The truth is that the leadership came from the bottom, so to speak; not the top. The initiative required for these fundamental shifts in our society were born in the hearts of thousands of individual citizens, each of whom reached out to their respective communities, and were strung together delicately and persistently by a few motivated and foresighted leaders like Arnie Aronson. 
The reality is that Arnie has no one to blame but himself for his lack of notoriety. Arnie, as his friends and colleagues all know, shuns publicity with the same energy that some employ in its pursuit. But had Arnie been a self-promoter, then he never could have satisfied the complex interpersonal agendas necessary to organize so many disparate views, so many different goals, so many challenging attitudes. Arnie weaved together practically every major civil rights organization in the country into the grandparent of all coalitions, and perhaps still one of the most successful coalitions this century, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. Some of the organizations that eventually found a voice under his umbrella were in their infancy at the time and now are household names; others had such distinct agendas that it is nothing short of miraculous that they were willing to lend their names to any unified cause. But Arnie is a master consensus builder, and he accomplished more than most people could imagine, by advancing the interests of others rather than himself, by the practically unknown arts of self-sacrifice and behind-the-scenes hard work. 
By doing what he does, Arnie sets an example for us all. He has shown us what this Nation is capable of accomplishing, if it has the right goal in mind, and the will to reach that goal. He is an inspiration, because of his tolerance, his eagerness to hear out views that others might find offensive, his patience to find new, non-threatening ways of expressing strong opinions, and his ability to harness and channel tremendous energy in productive directions. There are millions of Americans enjoying lives and jobs and suffering far less discrimination than their parents endured, thanks to Arnie. 
Mr. President, Arnie Aronson should be anything but a secret in this nation. He is a role model for us all.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Of course, the Senator will stay within the 60 minutes. And, I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, far less than 60 minutes. I just wanted to add a couple of things to what the Senator from Illinois has just said. 
First of all, I really appreciate the emphasis of the Senator from Illinois on representative democracy in our country. I think this is the central issue for this Congress. I think this is the most important issue in American politics. I have spoken before on the floor of the Senate about this. I am not going to repeat what I have said already. 
But I really think, if we want to have people engaged in the political process, if we want people to register to vote and vote in elections, if we want people to believe in our political process, if we want people to believe in us, then I think we absolutely have to deal with this awful mix of money and politics. Because regular people--which I use in a positive way--in Illinois and Minnesota and Oklahoma and around the country, know that, No. 1, too much money is spent on these campaigns; No. 2, some people count more than others and there is too much special interest access and influence; No. 3, there is too much of a money chase and Senators from both political parties have to spend entirely too much time raising money. 
I just ran for office. I had to raise the money. 
And, No. 4, I think people in the country know that it is getting dangerously close to the point where either you are a millionaire yourself, or you have to be very dependent upon those that have the hugest amounts of capital for these expensive capital-intensive TV campaigns. Otherwise, you are disqualified. 
In a democracy, people should not be, de facto, disqualified because they are not wealthy or because they do not have access to those people who have the wealth or the economical clout or the political clout in America. That turns the very idea of representative democracy on its head. That takes the very goodness of our country and turns it on its head. That takes the American dream and turns it on its head. I have said it before, but it is worth repeating, that if you believe in the standard that each person ought to count as one and no more than one, then you would be for reform. 
My last point, because I could talk about this for a long, long time, my colleague was kind enough to mention the McCain-Feingold bill. He was kind enough to mention the bill that yesterday we agreed to introduce, Senator Kerry and I, and Senator Glenn and Senator Reid; and Senator Bumpers was there as well. 
Mr. President, the point today is as follows. I think people--unfortunately, but the proof is going to be in eating the pudding--believe that what is going on in the Congress amounts to little more than symbolic politics. I think people believe we are going to have a committee investigation, an attempt to move some of these issues to the Rules Committee, maybe try and bury this here, maybe have hearings and hearings and hearings, then have a variety of different charges or countercharges made, maybe more polarization, maybe more accusations. Then, after all is said and done, it will be the same moving picture shown over and over and over again, where you have hearings, speeches, reports, witnesses, you name it, followed by the same hearings, the same speeches, the same calls to action, the same kind of investigations, followed by inaction. I do not understand, for the life of me, why we do not move forward. I think the purpose of this resolution is to say, set a date. 
A good friend of mine, Jim Hightower, who was great on the Ag Committee, loves to say, `You don't have to be `Who's Who' to know what's what.' People in this country have figured this out. It is time for reform. We know more than enough about what is wrong. We know more than enough about what is wrong with this game, the ways it is broken, and it is time to fix it. 
So this resolution calls for a date certain. It is right on mark, and I am proud to support it. 
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on April 1, the Nation will begin to see the disastrous effects of the Personal Responsibility and Work Act of 1996, passed and signed into law in the 104th Congress. When Congress debated the bill, strong arguments were made for getting people off welfare and back to work. I supported those intents. However, I believed then as I do now that the bill we were debating went beyond what is humanly justifiable in terms of repealing basic assistance to people who are in need. This bill was not about able bodied people working. It was about good people suffering. Under the guise of able bodied people working, we are forcing disabled and elderly people into hunger, into homelessness. 
Beginning around April 1, roughly 500,000 legal immigrants will lose their SSI benefits and about 1 million will lose food stamps. By the year 2002, approximately, 260,000 elderly immigrants and 140,000 children will lose Medicaid coverage. 
The bill I am introducing today restores those benefits to elderly and disabled immigrants by repealing provisions of the Personal Responsibility Act of 1996. 
When the American people supported welfare reform, they supported that able bodied people would work. I want that. You want that. However, I do not think that the American people intended the ensuing consequences. 
These consequences are people like Yanira, who, with her husband came to the United States legally 20 years ago from her native El Salvador. For 20 years they raised three children. For 20 years, they paid income taxes. For 20 years, they paid sales taxes. For 20 years they paid State taxes. For 20 years, they paid their car registration. For 20 years, they abided by the laws and rules here. 
Then Yanira's husband divorced her. So, Yanira got a job. For about 8 years she cleaned toilets, washed floors and laundered towels in a hotel near her home. Eventually, the work became too demanding physically and she quit. At 64, Yanira has received SSI for a few years. Soon, she will not. 
Since her husband is no longer married to her, she is not entitled to count her husband's work history toward the required 40 quarters--10 years. In spite of the fact that we willingly took her taxes and other fiscal contributions, we are denying her the basics for human survival, human dignity. How will Yanira survive? She doesn't know. Neither do I. 
Yanira's situation is not isolated. There are Yaniras living in Minnesota, in Ohio, in New York and Mississippi. They are here legally but will not receive SSI until they become U.S. citizens. Many of them are elderly and cannot work and considering their age, learn all that is necessary to become citizens. They will be denied benefits for the rest of their lives. 
Gladys has lived in the United States for 40 years, working as a nanny--caring for children in our Nation. Though she paid taxes and followed all the rules of the United States, she will lose her SSI benefits in July. She does have the option of struggling through forms and tests to become a citizen. Sounds like a good option until you realize: Gladys is 105 years old, blind and housebound. Gladys spent a good share of her times caring for and nurturing our children. She now needs the same. 
Lucrecia has lived here for 17 years. For 8 of them, she labored in a factory, assembling artificial Christmas trees. At 75, facing the loss of her sole means of support, Lucrecia is desperate. 
Rose, a 92-year-old, came from Lebanon 76 years ago. She has lived in a nursing home for the past 30 years. She has dementia. In December, she received a letter from the Government. The letter said, in essence, Rose had been shirking her responsibilities and she will no longer receive her benefits that support her stay in a nursing home. She can't speak for herself. I think we should speak for her. We should send the message that this is unacceptable. We must not let this happen to Rose. 
During my many visits with communities in Minnesota and while talking with folks here, I have never seen more fear in the faces of so many people, so many good people, people who came to this country and followed the rules. I hear stories every day of people so full of fear that they take their own lives. 
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity and Reconciliation Act has abjured the contributions the legal immigrants like Yanira have made to our economic livelihood. I ask, How will their contributions be rewarded? Taxation without benefits is morally wrong. 
Last year, we discussed and debated the merits and failings of the welfare reform law. As you know, I voted against it. I did not vote against it because I am against people working, people contributing to our country. I did not vote against it because I am against paychecks replacing welfare checks. I voted against it because I am against pushing the unemployable into poverty. I am talking about benefits for the disabled and elderly immigrants in our country. On April 1, we will see the first trickle in the torrent of suffering that this bill will inflict on our Nation's most vulnerable. 
Around this time last year, we heard testimony from Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation that `welfare is becoming a way of life for elderly immigrants.' A picture was painted depicting newly arrived immigrants being picked up by a sponsor at the airport and driven in a Cadillac directly to the welfare office to sign up for benefits such as SSI and food stamps. While I will not argue with you that there has been some abuse, I think this assertion is absurd. 
Last year, Robert Rector also testified that `the presence of large numbers of elderly immigrants on welfare is a violation of the spirit, arguably, the letter, of U.S. immigration law.' I beg to differ. This country was based on the dignity of the human spirit, fairness and equity. The spirit of this country is to give voice to the voiceless, to care for the elderly and to nurture the children. 
When we talk about reform, we should focus on change for the better, improvements to the system, revisions on our mistakes. When we talk of reform, we should not be discussing more people in hunger, more people who are homeless, more people in poverty. That is what this `reform' has led to. 
People who supported the welfare reform bill said they `responded to the wishes of the American people and put an end to the widespread use and abuse of our welfare system.' I am asking you now to respond to the voice of the American people. A recent nationwide L.A. Times poll found that 56 percent of the American people favor restoring cuts to legal immigrants. Not too long ago, several Republican Governors were here. They are already anticipating the effects of this legislation. The American people do not want people like Gladys and Lucrecia left hungry and homeless. They want responsible, ethical government. 
Responsible, ethical government costs money. I know that. I propose that instead of taking food from our Nation's elderly and children, we tax oil companies, we tax tobacco companies, we tax pharmaceutical companies. Why should wealthy corporations flourish and benefit from our policies while hardworking, law abiding people go hungry? This is not reform. This is a sham. Furthermore, it is shameful. 
People like Gladys and Lucrecia don't have high-paid lobbyists. Privileged industries avoid paying their fair share of taxes because of the efforts of lobbyists. I propose that we take away the privileges of the wealthy and provide necessities for the poor. 
Today, I am imploring you to look beyond politics and look beyond polls and see the faces and hear the stories that this reform will portend. This is no longer a political issue. This is an issue concerning humanity. To disregard this population, to turn our backs on those who are so vulnerable is disgraceful and dishonorable. Tonight, you know where you are sleeping. Tonight, you know what you will eat. Soon, Gladys and Lucrecia will not be able to say the same.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined by my colleagues and original cosponsors Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Patty Murray, and Senator Byron Dorgan in reintroducing the Victims of Abuse Insurance Protection Act, legislation that will outlaw discrimination by insurance companies against the victims of domestic violence in all lines of insurance. Congressman Bernie Sanders is introducing an identical bill in the House this week. 
With this legislation, we are trying to correct an abhorrent practice by many insurance companies--the denial of coverage to battered women. It is plain, old-fashioned discrimination. It is profoundly unjust and wrong. And, it is the worst of blaming the victim. Denying women access to the insurance they require to foster their mobility out of an abusive situation must be stopped. 
While we were successful in including language in the Kassebaum-Kennedy law which prohibits insurers from denying insurance because the applicant is a victim of abuse, insurance companies can still charge victims of abuse a higher rate. 
In Minnesota, three insurance companies denied an entire women's shelter insurance because, as a battered women's shelter, we were high risk. The Women's Shelter in Rochester, MN, was told that it was considered uninsurable because its employees are almost all battered women. 
Another shelter in rural Minnesota purchased a car so that women and children in danger who were trying to leave an abusive situation could use this anonymous vehicle and thus the abuser could not track their automobile to find them. The shelter could not find a company to provide them with automobile insurance once the companies knew of the risks surrounding battered women. 
A woman in Iowa named Sandra was denied life insurance after the company found out that she had been beaten up twice. In one incident, she had been so badly beaten by an ex-boyfriend that her cheekbones were splintered, and one of her eyes had to be put back in its socket. Her mother, Mary, was the one who originally applied for the life insurance policy, explaining, `I didn't ask for a lot of coverage. I just wanted to apply for $1,000 coverage, just enough that if something happened, God forbid, that we could at least bury her.' 
Mary was angry about the denial, so she wrote to State officials and the Iowa insurance commissioner's office tried to intervene on their behalf. In four separate letters, the insurance company officials stated they denied the coverage because of a history of assaults. In one letter they defended their decision by citing numerous documents which showed that people involved in domestic violence incidents are at a higher risk of death and injury than others, and, therefore, not a good risk. 
There are, unfortunately, many other instances of victims of domestic abuse being denied fire insurance, homeowners insurance, life insurance, and health insurance--denied because they were victims of a crime. 
This bill goes a long way toward treating domestic violence as the crime that it is--not a voluntary risky behavior that can be easily changed and not as a pre-existing condition. Insurance company policies that deny coverage to victims only serve to perpetuate the myth that victims are responsible for their abuse. 
In order to address the practice of insurers using domestic violence as a basis for determining whom to cover and how much to charge with respect to health, life, disability, homeowners, and auto insurance, this legislation prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against victims in any of the following ways: 
First, denying or terminating insurance; second, limiting coverage or denying claims; third, charging higher premiums; or fourth, terminating health coverage for victims of abuse in situations where coverage was originally issued in the abuser's name, and acts of the abuser would cause the victim to lose coverage. 
This legislation also keeps victims' information confidential by prohibiting insurers from improperly using, disclosing, or transferring abuse-related information for any purpose unrelated to the direct provision of health care services. 
Insurance companies should not be allowed to discriminate against anyone for being a victim of domestic violence. We may never know the full extent of the problem, but it is a grossly unfair practice and should be prohibited.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues--and I have a lot of respect for my colleagues on the other side--I think the decision of the Rules Committee doesn't represent a step forward, it represents a great leap sideways. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee had voted unanimously to have a full inquiry. The inquiry certainly was going to focus on illegalities, but also on improprieties. That's the way we should proceed. The Rules Committee has stripped down the scope. And for people in the country who care fiercely about our getting away from auctions and back to elections, for people in the country who care about our getting away from what we have right now, which is pseudo-democracy, with big money dominating, back to authentic democracy, what the Rules Committee has done represents not a step forward, but a great leap sideways. It is a great leap sideways from an investigation that has to take place. 
Mr. President, I know that sometimes we don't know what we don't want to know. But, quite frankly, I don't believe that this Congress is going to be able to step sideways from a full investigation into all of the ways in which money has come to dominate politics today in the United States of America. 
Mr. President, my colleague Senator Glenn, at some point in his prepared remarks, said something like: Even what is legal quite often can be scandalous when you are looking at all the ways which money and politics interact today, and it really undercuts the whole idea of representative democracy. 
He is absolutely correct. We all know that there are all sorts of examples of, No. 1, too much money being spent in these campaigns; No. 2, too much special interest access; we all know all about that; No. 3, too much of a money chase with Senators spending way too much time, more than any of us want to, raising money; No. 4, therefore, a system where regular people, ordinary citizens, which I do not use in a pejorative sense but in a positive way, don't even think they can play the game. That is what we are facing--money determining who gets to run, money determining who is considered a viable candidate, money determining the outcome of an election, money determining what issues are on the agenda, money determining which people are here lobbying every day and which are left out, and money determining the outcome. This really represents a corruption. But I am not talking about corruption as in the wrongdoing of individual officeholders. I am not here to bash any colleague on either side of the aisle. I am talking about a corruption which is systemwide. It is systemic. It is systemic corruption in the following sense: Too few people with this system we have right now, this rotten system we have right now, have far too much wealth, power, say, and access to decisionmakers, and the vast majority of people are left out of the loop. That is what is going on in the country. 
My colleagues want to narrow the scope of inquiry. The Rules Committee basically has made an end run around the Governmental Affairs Committee. The Governmental Affairs Committee at one point in time had a unanimous vote. What happened? What happened? At one time the Governmental Affairs Committee said we are going to be a reform committee, and we are going to look at illegal behavior--by the way, we should; I am not defending any of it--and, in addition, we are going to look at improper behavior, what is inappropriate, and if people have special-color stamps for big contributors, maybe that is not appropriate, and if people take folks on trips and give them access to Republicans and Democrats based on their being big contributors, maybe that is not right. If people have special meetings, special dinners with special access to Senators because they are big givers or heavy hitters or well connected, maybe that is not right. Or if there is evidence of people being invited to help write legislation because they are big givers, maybe that is not right. Or if there is a meeting with a business community or labor community and one party or the other says, `We noticed you have made contributions to Members of the other party, and you had better not do that or you're not going to have access to us,' that is not right. The list goes on and on. 
What is legal is scandalous. This whole system needs to be turned not upside down--it is upside down right now--but right side up. We need to get the big money out of politics. We need to get the big money out of politics. Anybody who believes in free and open elections, anybody who believes in political equality, anybody who believes that each person in the United States of America should count as one and no more than one, should be genuinely horrified with this system that we now have. 
Mr. President, I think--I hope I am proven wrong--but I think the action of the Rules Committee represents not a step forward but a great leap sideways. I have my doubts as to whether or not we are going to pass the reform that gets the big money out of politics. Given the scope now at least of Governmental Affairs, they are not going to be looking at soft money, they are not going to be looking at independent expenditure, they are not going to be looking at what the New York Times yesterday in their editorial called systematized influence peddling, which by the way is a bipartisan invention. And when we narrow the scope and don't look at all of the abuses --we can have abuses; they may not be illegal but they are abuses--it is arrogance. It is what people in the country hate. It is what destroys confidence on the part of people in our political process. When we don't look at any of that, how convenient it will be. Because, if we do not have a full inquiry into all of these abuses, into all of this improper behavior, into 
all of the ways in which legally big money has come to dominate politics, guess what? We don't make the case for reform. 
My concern is as follows: I think if we are not careful--on this point, even though I am in sharp policy disagreement with him, I think Senator Warner is the best when it comes to civility. I do not have any question about him at all when it comes to civility. But my concern is that we have to really be careful so that what doesn't happen here--is that you have just got people going after each other with accusations, throwing bombs at each other, and all of the rest--is that we don't get down to what should be the real business, which is when push comes to shove there is plenty of blame on all sides. I include myself as being a part of the problem. I want to be part of the solution. I have said, in my not so humble opinion, that everybody in public office should hate this system and want to change it because when you run for office you have to raise money. I just finished running for office, and I raised money. You call people. You call people to ask them to support you. We do that. You may believe--and I did believe and I do believe --that the compelling necessity to raise money in these campaigns, given the current system, that it has never once influenced any position you have taken on any issue. You may believe that. But I tell you something. It doesn't look that way to people. Even if you are very honest--and I think my colleagues are--it doesn't look that way to people. We have to change this system. 
My real concern--and we will have an amendment or several amendments on the floor of the Senate starting tomorrow--is that what the Rules Committee has done is not moving us forward, but, as I say, it is a great step sideways. It is a great step sideways from full inquiry. It is a great step sideways so the Governmental Affairs Committee is not really looking at all of the abuses. It is a great step sideways in not looking at the full range of problems and not looking at all of the ways in which money dominates politics. Therefore, is it is a great step sideways from reform. 
I mean, ultimately here is the litmus test for all of us. Speeches can be made. I am making this speech right now on the floor. Words can be uttered. But really the litmus test is, are you or are you not, regardless of political party, interested in change? Are you interested in getting this big money out of politics? Are you interested in having these Senate races with less money being spent? Are you interested in elections as opposed to auctions? Are you interested in reducing special interests access to decisionmaking? Are you interested in a system where there is a level playing field for challengers? Yes, challengers who can challenge all of us who are incumbents whether we are Democrats or Republicans. I will tell you. I do not think most people in the country think we are interested in that. I do not think most people in the country think we are going to pass any significant reform. I think most people in the country think that this is as much of a debate between ins and outs as Democrats versus Republicans, and the ins don't want to change a system that is really a great benefit to the ins; that is to say, people who hold office. 
I am telling you that I think all of us are under a lot of scrutiny. And I think we had better figure out a way that we push through some significant reform, and it had better not be cosmetic, it had better not be one of these pieces of legislation that has a great acronym, a kind of made-for-Congress look; you know, sounds great, but as a matter of fact very little substance by way of really changing this system. I do not think we are heading in that direction. I think the Rules Committee decision takes us not forward, but again I think it represents, if not a retreat, the best I can say is it is a step sideways. That is why we will have an amendment or amendments on the floor demanding a full inquiry. 
By the way, Mr. President, in the debates that I have been in, the argument I usually have to do deal with is, `Well, this is just some kind of convenient strategy because you don't want to focus on the illegalities.' Of course, we do. But there is nothing mutually exclusive about saying get the facts about illegalities, then there is a full investigation and people are held accountable, but also look at the abuses, also look at the improprieties, also look at the reform issue, also go down the path of changing the system for the better. 
Mr. President, that, I think, is the missing piece. That will be our challenge on the floor of the Senate, and that is the direction that we have to go in.

Mr. WELLSTONE. There is an A and a B part. A, I do not think people in the United States of America need to be convinced that there are huge problems, and I do not think they believe we do not already know what many of those problems are. It is not like all of a sudden we have to get all sorts of more and more investigation to know what we can do. But I think the investigation can be helpful if you have a full scope of inquiry. I think now where we have gone with the Government Affairs Committee is a step sideways, and I think we should take action.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, to respond to the question--and I believe my colleague has asked a question--I do not know any other way to say this but to be straightforward and honest. The proof will be in the pudding. But I think once upon a time the Governmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of Senator Thompson was going to look at illegalities; it was going to look at improprieties; it was going to be a full scope of inquiry, and I think we were looking in the proper direction. 
With all due respect to my colleague, whom I respect, I think the majority of the Rules Committee is not interested in reform. I think the Rules Committee could very well be a burial ground for reform. Now, if I am wrong, I am pleased to be wrong. But right now, as I think about some of the people who are most active on the Rules Committee and some of the people I have heard speak on this, certainly some of them have made it crystal clear that they are not interested in any reform at all.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Virginia. I say that I felt I was just expressing my honest opinion about what I think is going to happen in the Rules Committee. And my comment was not aimed at my friend from Virginia. 
Mr. President, I will say one more time--and I will finish up because I see my colleague from Mississippi is here and I know my colleague from Mississippi is going to agree with everything I am saying so I am anxious for him to get the floor. But let me just finish up. Two points. 
One, I think it is problematical, I think it is suspect, I think it is weaving and bobbing and dancing around and a big step sideways to have moved the Government Affairs Committee away from what should have been the scope of the inquiry. We are going to come out here to the floor with language which is going to make it clear that we are serious about reform. And we know that what is key to reform is an investigation not only of illegalities--and you get into a definitional battle over that--but also what is improper, what is not appropriate. You name it. And also all of the ways in which money and politics have now interacted in such a way as to severely undercut the very idea of representative democracy and really undercut the trust people have in our political process. That is No. 1. 
No. 2. I just think people in the country are scratching their heads and saying, these folks in the Senate, they are saying that they actually need a lot of time to study all of these problems and they do not want to make a commitment to any date to bring up any piece of campaign reform legislation; permit us to be a little skeptical. We have this idea that politicians are pretty good at delay, and they are pretty good at sidestepping issues, and they are pretty good at not getting down to the work; permit us to be a little skeptical. 
How much more do people need to know about abuses, improprieties or illegalities in order to make some change? Many of us, my colleague is right, are pushing for some action. Now, I am not arrogant enough to say that one person has all the ideas about what should be done, but I do get very concerned about sidestepping here, narrowing the scope of inquiry here, delaying here and maybe, just maybe, at the very end laboring mightily and producing a mouse--hardly any kind of reform. 
I want to tell you, if we do that, people in the country should hold us accountable. 
I think that my colleagues, some colleagues, fail to make a distinction. I could be wrong about this. But I am coming to believe that every day there is a headline about something new. I think people read it and they just quickly go on to other stories. I think part of the reason is, unfortunately, people's expectations are not very high, and that should trouble all of us. But at the very core, what is inside of people in this country, is we do not like this system at all. We do not feel as though we are well represented. We feel ripped off and we want you to change it. 
I would say to my colleagues--yes, we talked about McCain-Feingold. I support McCain-Feingold. I worked with both Senators from the word go. I think it is an important, significant reform effort. 
If I had my way I would go the `Maine option,' legislation which really gets the interested money and private money out; a major overhaul of the system. If not, Senator Cochran and I had an opportunity to be at a show last night and I said, `Look, I will come to the floor with an amendment just to prohibit soft money.' We are going to take action. There are a variety of different approaches and there are other things that can be done that represent reform. But I say to my colleagues, ultimately it gets down to this. We have to dramatically reduce the amount of money that is spent. We have to dramatically reduce the influence of interested dollars and special interest access to decisionmakers. We have to dramatically reduce this money chase. And we have to move toward something that approximates, more or less, a level playing field so we have competitive elections and so challengers have a chance against incumbents. 
If we do not do that, we have not done the job. I think people are going to hold us to that standard. So we might be debating kind of the process we are going through to get to the end. But we need to get there together at the end. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have had a lot of focus in the media about money and politics, and we are involved in a debate here on the Rules Committee about the Government Operations Committee and the scope of the inquiry. I thought I would speak in this Chamber for a few moments about what I think is the most important issue in American politics. I guess I want to start out by saying to colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, and to people in the country, if what happens in the Congress is that you just have accusations going back and forth and the climate becomes really poisonous, I fear we will not do anything right. 
I really do believe that this is the core issue of American politics. I think the ethical issue of our time is the way in which money has come to dominate politics. I do not think it is so much the wrongdoing of individual officeholders. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I have said it in debates, I have said it in interviews: The whole system is inappropriate. The whole system is inappropriate. It needs to be turned not upside down --it is upside down right now--but right side up. 
If we are going to talk about any kind of corruption, it is not the wrongdoing of individual officeholders. We are talking about something far more serious. It is systemic corruption. By systemic corruption, I mean we now have reached the point where too few people have way too much wealth, power and say, too much access, too much say by virtue of their economic resources and their big contributions, and the vast majority of people feel left out of the loop. 
That is the fundamental issue. To most people in the country, the vast majority of people in the country, it is really clear: 
First, too much money is spent in these campaigns; 
Second, there is too much special interest access and influence as a result of the money spent; 
Third, too much time is spent by all of us--all of us--in what can be described as a money chase, trying to raise money because you are running for office; and 
Fourth, regular people, ordinary citizens, which I do not use in a pejorative sense but in a positive way, do not feel they can run for office. 
Mr. President, we are talking about nothing less than the question of whether or not we are going to have a real representative democracy. We have now really gotten to the point --and I am not going to use all the terms such as `independent expenditures' and `soft money' and `hard money.' Let me just make a more basic point. We are talking much more about auctions than elections. We are not even talking about authentic democracy anymore. It is a minidemocracy at best. If you believe that each person should count as one and no more than one, and you believe in equality and you believe in fair and open elections, people in the country know this is all trumped by big money. 
It is time for reform. It is time for reform. It is time to get big money out of politics. There are a lot of proposals. Some of us really believe you ought not to have any private money in the system and that ultimately, absolutely is the way to go. Some focus on other legislation. Some focus on soft money. 
I just want to make this clear, that we are going to be making a huge mistake, all of us are going to be making a huge mistake if we do not pass a major reform bill this Congress. We are going to make a huge mistake if the only thing this boils down to is just sort of piling acquisitions on accusations and people going after one another. If this becomes a kind of slash-and-burn politics, search-and-destroy politics, we are going to get absolutely nowhere. 
I will say this. I am only speaking for myself. I do not know how the Chair feels. Actually, I believe, even though the argument is made often that the problem is that those in office do not really want to change the system because the system is wired toward incumbents, because we are able to raise more money than our challengers--the statistics bear that out--I think it has come to the point where all of us should hate the system, because when you are raising money and you are running for office and you have to be on television and you are trying to figure out how you are going to go after your opponent and destroy your opponent--that is the way some people view politics; they should not but they do--or you are figuring out how to raise millions of dollars so you do not get ripped up into shreds, the fact is even if you are absolutely sure in your head and your heart that not one time has the compelling need to raise money ever affected any position you have ever taken on any issue, it certainly does not look that way to the public. 
I am convinced that all the good things that could happen here are trumped by money in politics. I am convinced that one of the reasons we are not responding to the very real concerns of citizens across this country, which have to do with affordable education and good jobs and the standard of living and reducing violence in communities and all the rest of it, is because of this influence of money in politics. 
This is the core issue. There is too much access for the big givers and the heavy hitters and the well connected, and the vast majority of people feel left out of the loop and they are right. What concerns me is I have heard some colleagues say, `But the fact of the matter is, the polls do not show this. The polls do not show that the people seem to consider this a burning issue.' 
I think what is sad is that people's expectations are so low in the country right now that they are not at all sure there is anything we are going to do about this. But we better prove ourselves to the people we are asked to represent. We better pass a reform bill. We better make sure that we dramatically reduce the amount of money that is spent in these campaigns. We better make sure we try to lessen--if you cannot eliminate it, at least lessen--special-interest access. We better make sure we do something about this constant money chase. We better make sure our elections do look like elections and not like auctions. We better make sure that people in the country, whether they are Democrats or Republicans or independents, feel like they can run for office. We better do that, because this is all about democracy. 
We keep spending more and more money every election cycle, and participation goes down, down, down. So I am hopeful, even though this is a tough time in the Senate. We have major divisions. People are drawing the line. It seems to be an all-out battle. By the way, I am all for good debate. I do not like to hate but I like debate. But I am telling you, every single one of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, are making a big mistake if we do not line up behind major reform. 
We should want to do this. If we want people to at least have more confidence in the political process than they have now, if we want people to begin to believe in us, if we want people to believe in the legislation that we pass, which is a product of this process, then people have to believe that politics in Washington, DC, is not dominated by big money. People have to believe the Congress belongs to them, that the Capitol belongs to them, that all of us, Democrats and Republicans, belong to them. 
I know I may sound melodramatic on the floor of the Senate, especially since today there is no one to debate. But I came to the floor to speak because I am absolutely convinced that this is the priority. There is nothing that we could do that would be more important than to try to move forward on a reform agenda. I am hoping that, in this Congress, we will do that. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I chose to vote against the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, like I have in the past. 
Many good arguments were made throughout the debate against amending the Constitution of the United States to require a yearly balanced Federal budget. In fact, the Senate voted 14 times on amendments to improve the underlying resolution, in the hope of revealing its shortsightedness. In every instance, I supported my colleagues. I believe we were successful in painting a clear and honest picture of the disastrous effects such an amendment could have on the economic and social fabric of this country. 
This debate is about our Nation's spending priorities as much as it is about constitutional integrity. During the course of debate, I offered an amendment that would have made it a policy of the United States that in meeting the requirements of an annual balanced budget no cuts would be made that disproportionately affect children's programs in the areas of health care, nutrition, and education. Look at the evidence. 
In the 104th Congress, dramatic cuts were made to programs for low-income families. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, more than 93 percent of the cuts in entitlement programs came from programs for low-income people. Congress reduced entitlement programs by $65.6 billion over the period from 1996 to 2002. In a letter of opposition to the BBA, the Women Legislator's Lobby, a group that speaks for women legislators across the country, pointed out to Senators that in 1997 the Federal Government spent four times more on the military than on housing, education, job training, and community development combined. 
The people of Minnesota sent me to Washington to make tough, responsible, fair decisions. Amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget would put a legally binding dollar target above the economic and social health of our country. Our goal of achieving fiscal responsibility should appropriately focus on critical investments in programs that provide basic nutrition, housing, health care, and education to those less fortunate, especially children. 
Our fixation with a constitutional amendment and our hunger for political gain have detracted from that important task. I will continue to press forward on finding a fair and equitable way to balance the budget because I think it is important to our country's future. Amending the Constitution in this way is not the answer.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while we have begun to make important progress toward seriously addressing the devastating physical and emotional effects of domestic violence, little attention has been paid to the severe economic consequences of domestic abuse. The Battered Women's Employment Protection Act, which I am introducing today, will ensure eligibility for unemployment compensation to women who are separated from their jobs as a direct result of domestic violence. Several new studies illustrate the need for the legislation I am introducing today. The evidence is irrefutable, domestic violence dramatically affects women's ability to work and support themselves and their children. 
According to New York City's Victims Service, one-quarter of battered women recently surveyed who have survived abuse had lost their jobs due to the effects of domestic violence. 
Abusive husbands and partners harass 74 percent of employed battered women at work, either by showing up at the workplace or calling them at work. It is not unusual for women in abusive relationships to be late for work at least 5 times a month, to leave early at least 5 times a month, and to miss at least 3 full days of work a month--National Work-place Resource Center on Domestic Violence. 
There have been cases brought to my attention in my home State of Minnesota where the women trying to escape abusive relationships could have benefited from this legislation, and we know that, sadly, there are many more such stories throughout the country. 
On February 12, 1997, a woman came into the Women's Rural Advocacy Program in Marshall, MN, after her partner had emotionally, verbally, and physically assaulted her. After many years of fighting, her abuser finally let her get a drivers license and a car. His motivation for allowing her to do this was that she could get a job, resulting in more money for himself. Three months into her job, her partner assaulted her and she was in need of safe housing and constant protection. Because of the fear of her abuser finding her and her child, it was not safe for her to take their child to daycare, so she was unable to get to work. Seeing that this was a new job, she did not have any vacation days she could use. 
Her abuser soon found out where she was located. She panicked and took her child and left the shelter, presumably the city, her friends, and her job. The shelter advocate we spoke to had no idea where she went, but was sure she had no money, very little clothes, and no car. 
A woman, known as Sarah, is a 34-year-old college educated mother of 5 children, all under the age of 12. Sarah and her husband of 15 years had a successful market research company. Their combined salaries totaled over $225,000. The husband was the president of the company, Sarah the vice president. They were equal share holders in the company until Sarah came in contact with law enforcement and the Lewis House Shelter due to her hospitalization for extensive injuries suffered at the hands of her abusive husband. 
Sarah admits that the abuse has gone on for years. She filed for an order of protection, filed assault charges, and filed for divorce. Her husband then fired Sarah from the company they started. Her lawyer tells Sarah that she can sue for her position to be reinstated in the company. Sarah knows she is not safe and that nothing can protect her or her children from the repeated pattern of abuse. She is faced with the loss of her position, her income, legal fees, medical bills, as well as the foundation of her children's lives. 
It took Sarah 6 months to find a full-time position. She has supported herself by using credit cards she maintained in her own name. She begins her new life with $30,000 of new debt. Her batterer maintains his company today, with no loss of position and an increase in income. 
For women attempting to escape a violent environment, this legislation can be a lifeline. 
There has been great progress in the last few years in societal and legislative response to violence within the home. One area that has not been sufficiently addressed, in my opinion, is the economic cost of domestic abuse. 
The Bureau of National Affairs recently estimated that domestic violence costs employers between 3 and 5 billion dollars per year. Domestic violence results in lower productivity, greater absenteeism, and increased health costs. 
The National Institute for Justice estimates that from 1987 to 1990, domestic violence cost Americans $67 billion a year. 
According to annual estimates for reported domestic violence injuries, family violence exacts a significant economic toll on the well-being of the family, and the United States. 
Forty-four million, three hundred ninety-three thousand, seven hundred dollars total annual medical costs, 21,000 hospitalizations, 28,700 emergency room visits, and 175,000 days lost from work. 
In addition--50 to 80 percent of women on AFDC are victims or past victims of domestic violence (Taylor Institute Study, 1996). One year after divorce, women's incomes average only 67 percent of their pre-divorce incomes compared to 90 percent for men (Report of the American Psychological Association Presidential Task Force on Violence and the Family, 1996). 
The Battered Women's Employment Protection Act will help women retain employment and financial independence by ensuring that employed victims of domestic violence can have time off from work to make necessary court appearances, seek legal assistance, and get help with safety planning, without penalty from the employer. 
This bill enables employees to use their family, medical, sick, and other leave in order to deal with 
circumstances arising from domestic abuse. 
Circumstances that would allow an employee to take leave include going to the doctor for injuries caused by domestic violence, seeking legal remedies such as going to court, seeking orders of protection, or meeting with a lawyer. 
Current Federal and State laws fail to address the negative economic consequences domestic violence can cause. Today, battered women are not expressly allowed to take leave from work to address the consequences of family violence--both the physical and legal effects. This bill will help women to escape abusive situations by helping them retain employment and financial independence. And, by requiring employers to provide leave to employees for the purpose of dealing with domestic violence and its aftermath--it does not increase costs to employers, it permits employees to use their existing leave to deal with domestic violence. 
Furthermore, to ensure that battered women can retain the independence necessary to leave their abusers without having to rely on welfare, the bill requires that States provide unemployment benefits to women who are forced to leave work as a result of domestic abuse. The bill ensures eligibility for unemployment compensation to women who are separated from their jobs as a direct result of domestic violence. For example, victims of abuse could not be denied unemployment if they were forced to leave their jobs because they had to relocate for safety reasons. Similarly, a woman would be eligible for unemployment compensation if she was fired from her job because she repeatedly showed up late for work with physical signs of abuse or was excessively absent from work as a result of abuse. In addition, the bill provides for specialized training of personnel in assessing unemployment compensation claims based on domestic violence. 
All of us here today are committed to doing what we can to help battered women and their children escape domestic violence. I urge my colleagues to join in this effort by cosponsoring the Battered Women's Employment Protection Act.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I introduce the Patient Protection Act of 1997. This bill addresses the issue of fairness in health care today. 
Mr. President, the last few years have seen an enormous growth in managed care health plans. Now, more than 50 percent of Americans are enrolled in some kind of managed care arrangement. We have learned a lot in the past several years about what works and what doesn't in managed care, in all kinds of health insurance for that matter. 
And, let me be clear that I recognize that there are things that are working well in managed care and other types of plans. We have seen a decrease in the rate of increase in healthcare costs. Health plans are emphasizing prevention and early intervention. Health plans are largely moving from managing costs to managing care to managing health. 
All of this is good, but enough time has gone by that we have found the problems, the glitches, the occasions and circumstances where patient and providers are not equal stakeholders in the systems and where they are treated unfairly, where their voices are either silent or disregarded. I am deeply concerned about the lack of availability of protections for patients and providers participating in all forms of health plans. This includes not only managed care plans in their various forms, but also point-of-service and traditional--fee-for-service--plans as well. The inclusion of self-insured plans, MEWA's multiple employer welfare agreements--and association plans is an important component of this act because it extends provisions to some of those consumers who most need the protections. 
Many States are currently developing and moving similar bills through their legislatures and assemblies. There is a clear cry for these corrections and protections. However, even if all 50 States were to pass patient protection acts, not all Americans would benefit from 
 these protections. I believe that now more than ever, Federal standards are needed to ensure that consumers are protected in our rapidly changing health care delivery environment. Almost 50 percent of Americans, those who belong to health plans regulated by the Federal Government, are excluded from State based protections. According to a report released by the GAO in July 1995, 44 million Americans are covered under exempt plans. There are an additional 70 million who are covered by other employer plans that may also be outside of the realm of State authority. In addition, self-funded plans are becoming more common, especially in smaller businesses. The standards that I am proposing should assure fairness for consumers and providers, while still encouraging health plans to pursue innovative approaches to providing high quality, cost-effective care. I am sure, Mr. President, that each of us is committed to fairness and understands the need for the Federal Government to work cooperatively with the States on this issue. 
My Patient Protection Act of 1997 will do several things that will ease the confusion so often present for consumers and providers in the health care system. It will assist them with their rights as participants in health plans. 
The act will award a grant to each State to establish an office of consumer education counseling, and assistance with health care. This will help consumers choose among the many plans available to them, understand their rights for appeals if care that their provider advises is denied, and receive support if they undertake a grievance procedure. These offices will be modeled after the successful ones in the Medicare Program, staffed largely by volunteers, that have helped seniors find their way through what might be for many an overwhelming situation. 
The act will require that health plans disclose certain information so that consumers and providers are better informed. Information that must be disclosed ranges from the financial health of the plan to its internal review process and criteria used in making decisions about treatment. No longer will there be a black hole in health plans into which very personal information about a patient goes, something unknown happens and out comes a decision to treat or not treat the problem. That simply is not the way to provide health care in a democracy. 
The act will require that plans ensure timely access to services and specialized treatment expertise, when clinically indicated. 
The act will require the development of health plan standards, including utilization review activities and handling of grievances of consumers or providers. Providers and consumers will be involved in the development of these processes. 
The act will protect providers by requiring mechanisms for due process and disallowing dismissal of providers from the panel of a health plan without cause. It adds antigag clause and whistle-blower protection in order to ensure that consumers receive information that they need about health care options and quality of health care. 
In a country where many are either uninsured or underinsured, it is especially important that attempts to control costs be accompanied by clear legal rights for consumers and providers. With a competitive insurance market lacking adequate consumer protections and a health care system that says it's OK to leave some people out, what's to prevent plans from discriminating against patients who are likely to need expensive clinical services? 
Mr. President, these are not anti-managed care provisions. As a matter of fact, they are not anti anything. They are positive steps that will restore a better balance between health plans, consumers, and providers. Responsible health plans already comply with the standards that the Patient Protection Act would establish. But the Patient Protection Act would ensure that all patients and providers are guaranteed at least a baseline of protection. 
We are currently seeing attempts to regulate health care on a disease-by-disease basis. This is not the best way to protect consumers and providers. We need to focus on maintaining the unique relationship between health care providers and their patients, so that optimal care is available. Congress should not be in the business of deciding how long a patient needs to stay in the hospital for treatment of a specific condition, or whether a specific technology should be offered to a specific patient. We should instead make certain that health care providers can take into account the uniqueness of each of their patients in developing a rational and appropriate plan of care that can be followed. We can do this by ensuring that consumers and providers are included in the utilization review and decisionmaking process. The framework provided by the Patient Protection Act of 1997 will allow this to occur. 
These issues will become increasingly important as managed care arrangements proliferate, competition increases, more and more Americans and children lose their health insurance coverage, and costs continue to escalate. Until we are willing to make the hard choices and deal with the underlying problems in our current system, the very least we should do is enact some sensible protections that safeguard patients' and providers' rights. 
Mr. President, many people are fond of saying that health care reform is happening now--employers are managing their costs by enrolling increasing numbers of employees in managed care plans and new provider networks are emerging daily. But with so much attention being paid to the cost and business of health care, the providers and patients are losing substantial control over decisions affecting patients' health. It is therefore all the more important that we provide patient and provider protections. The Patient Protection Act of 1997 will go a long way toward doing that.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I shall not object, I just wanted to bring up two quick questions with the majority leader. 
Last time after the swearing-in ceremony, the majority leader will remember that I said I might object and I asked the majority leader whether I could get some kind of a commitment for a clear timeframe for taking up comprehensive campaign finance reform. I do not know whether the majority leader is prepared to make that commitment tonight, but I do want to be clear that if by March when we come back there has been no commitment made as to when we will have a bill on the floor and how we will move forward on it--because otherwise I fear delay and delay and delay, much like we did with gift ban--I will start to take amendments, campaign finance reform amendments, and attach those amendments to other bills because I believe we have to move this discussion forward. I think people want action. 
I am interested in the response of the majority leader. I want to make clear to colleagues, because I think you need to give people a warning, that when we come to our next recess it may be the case that I will not agree to a unanimous consent. So I am using the model the majority leader and I worked out together at the end on gift ban and we came up with reform. I am using that model, and I think it is important for Senators to be out here on the floor really pushing very hard for this. I wonder whether the majority leader could tell me whether he has any plan now, whether we could get a specific time when we could have a bill--again, I am not trying to predetermine what the piece of legislation would be--on this floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I shall be brief, Mr. President. The majority leader, I appreciate his graciousness. I actually like his passion. It does not trouble me at all. 
Mr. President, I actually made it very clear that I am not trying to--he has his own ideas about what should be in a bill. I did not insist on a particular piece of legislation. We have the McCain-Feingold bill that has been much talked about and could be a vehicle that people could work with. 
My point is I learned through the gift ban we only finally took action when we just started putting that piece of legislation on other bills. The majority leader is, after all, the majority leader, and, yes, we are now on the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but the majority leader, I think, can be a real leader on this if we can get a commitment that says, look, we will not have delay and delay and delay. We will have a bill on the floor and resolve this by July 4 or whatever date the majority leader picks out, and that makes it clear to people in the country that we are not going to just stall and stall. 
The majority leader is talking about today's piece in the Washington Post, but the point is we do not really need to find out that there are problems in the way campaigns are financed. This has been going on for a long time. There is plenty to be fixed. People in the country are experts at what they do not like. There is no reason whatever that we cannot move forward with a bill. I just would like to get a commitment. I take it from what the majority leader has said today and the way he said it that he is not ready to make such a commitment. That is fine, but I want to be clear that if that is the case come March, I think the majority leader can expect to see at least on my part as a Senator from Minnesota, some different parts of campaign finance reform as amendments on other bills. 
I want colleagues to know that this time I am not objecting to the UC for recess. But, come next spring--and this is plenty of warning--that may very well happen.

<TEXT>
Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, yesterday I had a chance to speak for some time about this amendment and then Senator Hatch and I had a very honest exchange of views. Let me one more time just make clear to colleagues what this amendment says. This amendment says that if we are going to make a commitment by way of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, then we go on record that the Federal outlays, as we do this, should not be reduced in a manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition, and health programs for poor children. 
Yesterday my colleague, Senator Hatch, said I was asking for an exemption. There is no request for an exemption. This is just simply a request for fairness, and it just simply says let us not lock ourselves into a very harsh set of priorities. 
I also pointed out yesterday that in the last Congress, 93 percent of the cuts in entitlement programs were entitlement programs that affected poor people in America, too many of them poor children. I also cited the Committee on Economic Development, representing really some of the largest corporations in America, saying that what we did last time, last Congress, was really disproportionate and really not based on a standard of fairness, because we cut a lot of programs that were important to the nutrition and health care and educational status of children. 
I also quoted from the Concord Coalition, which has been a driving force for our balancing the budget, taking the same position. I also quoted from an editorial yesterday in the Washington Post. 
I think the most important thing that I did yesterday, though, Mr. President--and I would like to start this way today, and then develop these points, and then listen very respectfully to my colleague from Utah, and then respond to some of what he has to say--was to try to translate this debate into human terms. Yesterday, my colleague from Utah said, and I appreciated it, `You know, I don't agree with Senator Wellstone but he is very sincere in his conviction.' And I appreciated that. That's a tribute from another Senator. 
But this is really not about me. This is an amendment that I think is substantive, I think it is important, and I wish there would be 100 votes for it. Because the fact of the matter is, all too often--and that was the record last Congress and I think it has been the record of too many Congresses--when we come down to the nitty-gritty, to the point where the rubber meets the road, we do deficit reduction based on the path of least political resistance. And usually, all too often, it is not the special interests or heavy hitters or well connected or big givers who are the ones that we target. And poor children have been, with the exception of some Senators, the Chair is one of them--you have shown a tremendous commitment to what we can do at a neighborhood level, at a community level, as has the Senator from Missouri, by way of commitment to children. 
But all too often, poor children in America are faceless and voiceless in the U.S. Senate, and I just think that it is not at all inconsistent for Senators--even if they are for this amendment, to vote for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget--to at least vote for this proposition. As a matter of fact, we are going to make it clear we are going to do it on a standard of fairness, and we are not going to disproportionately make cuts in programs that so vitally affect the nutritional and the educational and the health care status of children.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Utah. Actually, the language of this amendment is constitutional. It is designed that way. If there is going to be a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, I say to my good friend from Utah--and he has taken the leadership on this, he 
absolutely believes in it--if that is the direction we go in, then it is quite appropriate for me to have an amendment to this amendment to make sure that we do not lock ourselves into some very harsh and distorted priorities. 
I tried the route of a sense of the Senate last Congress, and actually I lost a couple of times on a sense of the Senate that we would not take any action to create more hunger, malnutrition, and poverty among children. Finally, it was adopted on a voice vote. I wish there had been a recorded vote. Then I think we went ahead and, in fact, passed some legislation or provisions of some legislation that is going to create that.

I think this time around, given the track record of the last Congress and given the fact that the citizens that I am trying to represent today--poor children--do not seem to have much of a presence here, quite frankly, I do not think a sense-of-the-Senate amendment does the job.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and, again, I thank my colleague. I appreciate his kind words. I know he is very sincere in the offer. Again, what happened last time was we went ahead and adopted an amendment saying we would not take any action to create more malnutrition, hunger, or poverty among children, and then we went ahead and did budget cuts that, in fact, disproportionately affected poor people in America, many of them children. 
Mr. President, I really do view this amendment as a litmus test. I think I do want to draw a line in the sand here. If Senators put children first, and Senators believe we ought to 
invest in the health and skills and intellect and character of our children, and Senators understand--and they do--that what happens before kindergarten is so important, then I do not know why in the world we cannot make a commitment that when it comes to programs like Head Start and WIC and health care programs that affect poor children in America, that we at least make a commitment that we not disproportionately cut those programs. 
As to which programs, listen, with a lot of what is in this amendment, we are going to be writing implementing language, that is all going to be made specific. So I just do not think that critique really does any damage to this amendment. I would like to speak, again, about what is at stake. 
Yesterday, I read from some examples, just some stories of some families as we kind of reach out and talk to people around the country, not just Minnesota. Marlene is a lot like many women. She went from her parent's home to her husband's. With the exception of a waitressing job in high school, she never had worked outside the home, and had no job skills. After 9 years of marriage, Marlene's husband left her with two children and pregnant with a third. 
At 27, she found herself alone with no job skills or means of support. With the help of a neighbor, she enrolled in her local WIC Program. `I knew about nutrition, child care and how to take care of myself. I just didn't have the money to. I knew that I needed to have a healthy baby. I just did not know how to get it.' 
WIC provided Marlene with vouchers to purchase the basics for a healthy baby--milk, cheese, eggs, et cetera. 
To this day, I believe that the food from WIC saved me and my baby. Emotionally, I was so distraught and inept, I didn't know if I was coming or going. Thankfully for WIC, for that part of my life, I could just go on auto pilot. I knew that I was taking care of my baby. I could go on with taking care of the rest of the issues I was facing. 
It has been 10 years since Marlene received help from WIC. Now she works full time and supports her children. She says, 
WIC was crucial for me. WIC was like a bridge to help me go from being dependent on someone to learning how to take care of myself and my kids. It's like they took care of me so I could take care of the rest of my life. I cringe to think of how things would have been without it. 
Mr. President, Danielle is 8 years old. She looks closer to 6. Though a spirited and cheerful little girl, Danielle struggles in life. She was born at a low birth weight and has endured its effects. She will for a long time. 
As with many children born at a low birth weight, she has a limited immunity system and she catches a lot of colds and flus. She misses a lot of school. Like many children born at low birth weight, it takes Danielle a bit longer to figure things out in school. Says her teacher, `I see her little brain trying to figure things out. She works hard and struggles. She's always a few steps behind us.' 
While pregnant with Danielle, her mother had no prenatal care or guidance. 
Every 2 minutes a baby is born to a woman, a mother who had no prenatal care in our country. Her diet of chips, fast food, soda, and candy did not change during the 8 1/2 months of pregnancy. Danielle's mother did not participate in the Women, Infants, and Children Program. 
At 5, Danielle's sister Alfrieda is healthy and active. While pregnant with Alfrieda, her mother participated in WIC. She had a healthy diet, checkups, and guidance. When she gave birth, she then gave birth to a fit and strong baby. She named her after the WIC nurse who mentored her. 
Says their mother: 
I see how Danielle is not all there * * * how she's slow and kind of sick. They tell me it is 'cause of how it was when I was pregnant. I think they are right 'cause I really see a difference with my baby, Alfrieda. You would not know that Danielle is older. 
In one family, in the case of two sisters, we see the impact and influence that WIC has. Danielle will always be a little behind, a little slow, and a little weak. Alfrieda will always be a bit smarter than her older sister, a bit ahead of her older sister, and a bit stronger than her older sister. One small family and one big difference. 
Mr. President, I said this yesterday, the medical evidence is irrefutable and irreducible that the most important educational program for our country is to make sure that every woman expecting a child has a diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein; otherwise, that child at birth may not have the same chance as all of our children and grandchildren have. And that is wrong. The goodness of our country is for every child to have that chance. 
Mr. President, we do not even fully fund the Women, Infants, and Children Program right now, a program for women during pregnancy, a program for infants, and a program for small children who, by definition, do not have enough income to be able to purchase the food to have an adequate diet. 
We know the WIC Program has made an enormous difference. It saves us dollars. It enables children to have a head start. It enables children to go on and do well in school. We know all of that. The only thing this amendment says is, let us make a commitment if we are going to balance this budget that in this constitutional amendment to balance the budget we make a commitment we will not, as we move forward, disproportionately cut programs that affect the nutritional status of children. That is what this amendment is all about. 
It is not a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I do want to draw a line on this. I believe I should be able to get a strong vote for this. I do not think it should be tabled. This is all about, as we go forward with deficit reduction, who is going to decide and who is going to benefit, and who is going to be asked to sacrifice. 
Are we going to decide, as we did last Congress, that we are going to disproportionately cut programs that affect the quality of life for children, poor children in America? Who will decide to cut the nutrition programs and whose children will be hurt? They will not be our children, but they are all of God's children. I think we all agree on that. 
So I am really hopeful that I will get support for this amendment. This is about values. We talk about values. This is about values. This is about Minnesota values. 
If you asked people, are they in favor of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, they say yes. I have been in disagreement. I wish we would separate the capital investment part of the budget from on operating budget. I worry about it on political economic grounds. But forgetting that, most people say yes. But if you ask people, are you in favor of balancing the budget by making cuts in educational programs or nutritional programs or health care programs that affect children, they say no. 
So I am hoping that this will not be tabled and that Senators will vote for it. 
Arel is only 14 years old but has the responsibility of someone much older. He has two sisters. Even though they are at the right age and eligible for Head Start, they do not participate because the program near their home is full. I forget--I do not have the numbers right before me--but something like only 17 percent of the eligible 3-year-olds are participating and only 40 percent of the eligible 4-year-olds are participating. Really, we should work Head Start back, Mr. President, to age 1 and 2 as well. 
By the way, it should be decentralized. This is a parent-participation program. It should happen at the local level. It should happen at the neighborhood level. It can be done through nonprofits and it can be done through nongovernmental organizations. But when we know something works, when we know these kinds of programs give children a head start, why can't we make a commitment that we will not disproportionately cut these programs? Because if we do not make that commitment, I really fear that is what is going to happen. 
While we know how no Head Start will affect Arel's sisters, do we know how it is going to affect Arel? Their mother leaves for work as a bus driver at 4 a.m. She is working. This means Arel is responsible for the morning ritual with his sisters. After he gets them fed and dressed, Arel puts one sister on the handlebars of his bike and rides 5 miles to drop her off at affordable day care. He returns home and gets his second sister to drop her off. Since he cannot drop them off early, he is late for school every day. 
Because of tardiness, he failed his first-period class twice. Though a talented athlete and a popular kid, Arel does not stay after school for any activities. He would probably make the football team. He is interested in track. He would love to be in a dance troupe. Instead, Arel gets on his bike, rain or shine, to pick up his sisters one at a time. I will not reveal to you what no Head Start means for his sisters. We know that. Unfortunately, so does their brother, a boy who has no childhood. 
Finally, Mr. President, Marcus is a shy and quiet first-grader who finds himself in the principal's office for the third time in a week. I gave this example yesterday. According to his teacher, Marcus is either overagitated, annoying other students in class, or listless and disinterested in the class at hand. Marcus does not usually know what is happening in class and he does not know yet his colors, numbers, or alphabet. 
Though many of his class attends a Head Start program and learns the initial steps toward understanding school and learning, Marcus does not. He represents 1 of the 1.2 million children that, though eligible, could not participate in Head Start when he was younger. The program near his home was full. Not only were they full, but there was a year waiting list when Marcus's grandmother tried to sign him up. Though there was room at another program, it was too far for his grandmother to take him. 
Marcus stayed alone sometimes at home while his grandmother worked. Marcus is conspicuously behind his classmates. While his classmates scurry around the teacher to be read to, he had not yet held a book or ever been read to. While his classmates--I am going to repeat this--while his classmates scurry around the teacher to be read to, he has not yet held a book or ever been read to. 
Marcus does not know how to write his name, nor can he recite the alphabet. In a phrase, Marcus is not part of the culture of the school. Marcus' teacher is concerned and anxious about him. He is far behind his classmates, and she has little, if any, time to help him catch up. As each week progresses, he falls further behind and more frustrated. 
Already Marcus hates school and learning, counting the days until summer vacation. He knows he is different. He knows he does not understand. But he also knows there is not much he can do 
about it. 
Said his teacher: `I just don't know what can be done for him. I know that he needs a lot of one-on-one attention and love, but I just don't have the time or the resources. Every day, I feel him slipping and, frankly, it breaks my heart. He is a good boy and a smart boy. I feel as if he is being punished for what we did not do for him. I am worried that he will always hate school and suffer until he can leave. He tries so hard, sometimes,' says his teacher, `I want to cry.' 
Mr. President, I do not want Senators to make this amendment out to be what it is not. There is an amendment on the floor. It is a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. This amendment says, as a part of that constitutional amendment to balance the budget--if that is what we are going to do--we make a commitment that we are not going to disproportionately cut programs that affect the educational and nutrition and health care status of children. It is that simple. 
This is about values. This is about fairness. I think we should make that commitment. I think we should make that commitment. 
Mr. President, we can no longer give speeches about children and no longer have photo opportunities with children unless we are willing--unless we are willing--to invest in the health and skills and intellect and character of our children. Mr. President, that includes poor children, and that means we are part of local communities, but we are part of a national community. The U.S. Senate ought to go on record that these are our priorities. These poor children are a part of our priorities. That is appropriate, and it is the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, when Senators vote on this they should not confuse two different issues. There is not anybody on the floor of the Senate that I know of who is opposed to balancing the budget. There are Senators who oppose this amendment. 
My colleague keeps talking about balancing the budget or passing the constitutional amendment to balance the budget is the best thing that we can do for our children. My amendment speaks to the concerns and circumstances of the lives of poor children. Close to one out of every four children in America is poor. One out of every two children of color is poor. Every 30 seconds a child is born into poverty in our country. Every 2 minutes a child is born to a mother who has had no prenatal care. Every 12 or 13 seconds a child drops out of school, many of them children from poor families. And there is a higher correlation between high school dropout and winding up in prison than there is between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. 
Mr. President, all too many of our children are rushing into the arms of the police and not into parents' arms, or teachers' arms. 
My colleague used the word `gimmick.' This is no gimmick. This is a very serious amendment because for these children they don't have any future. How can you argue that a child who is born severely underweight and damaged and who can't do well in school is going to benefit by deficit reduction and balancing the budget 7 years from now? What about that child right now? How can you argue that the 50 percent of children or the 60 percent of children who could be given a head start but come to school without a head start not ready to learn are going to do well, if we do not make a commitment that we are going to invest in them? Balancing the budget 7 years from now does not help those children right now. 
There are 10 million children who have no health care coverage, most of them from working poor families, many of them with ear infections who have lost hearing; too many. Many can't read well because they should have had an eye examination. They can't afford it. Many of them should have dental care, and they come to school with an infected tooth and abscess. They can't learn well. It is difficult for children who are in pain and discomfort to learn well. 
If we do not make a commitment that in balancing this budget we will not balance this budget on the backs of those children and we proceed to do what we did in the last Congress, which is disproportionately cut programs that affect poor people and poor children in America, they don't have any future. What good does it do those children if we are going to balance the budget 6 years from now if we are going to savage them right now? 
This is all about values. And if my colleague means or is sincere--and he always is. I guess it is just an honest difference that we have--that surely we are not going to make these cuts, that is what we have done in the past because these children don't hire the lobbyists. They don't march on Washington every day, and one more time they are not the big givers. Maybe there is a connection with all that we are reading about money and politics. 
Mr. President, I ask all of my colleagues whether you are against this constitutional amendment to balance the budget or whether you are for it to vote for this amendment. It is all about fairness. We ought to go on record. We ought to make it clear that in our effort to balance the budget with a constitutional amendment--or the way I prefer to do it, not a constitutional amendment--that we go on record that we will not do what we have all too often done in the past--unfortunately, the evidence is clear--that we will not disproportionately cut the programs that benefit and affect the health and the nutrition and education of children. 
What is the definition? Just pick out the percentage of low-income programs that are part of the entitlement programs. Pick out the low-income programs for children that are part of the discretionary spending. Pick out the percentage, and in our overall cuts, don't cut them any higher. It is simple. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure it out. Let us not weave and dodge on this question. 
I hope that I can get a strong vote. It is a difficult debate because the Senator from Utah is one of the Senators whom I like the most and whom I respect the most. It is an honest disagreement. 
But I hope Senators will vote for this. It is the right thing to do. This does not say we are not going to balance the budget. This does not say we should not do what the Senator from Utah believes we should do. It just says that if we are going to lock ourselves into a constitutional amendment, or, if we do not do that, we are still going to make the commitment to balance the budget, that we will not balance the budget on the backs of poor children; that we will invest in the skills, health, and character of children in America, including poor children. These are all God's children. I am telling you something, and I could argue this for 24 straight hours, the history of the way we have done deficit reduction is that they come out on the short end of the stick. 
This amendment I think is the right thing to do. It puts us on record and it makes it clear that we are going to balance this budget based upon the Minnesota standard of fairness. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have left?

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Ambulance Services Act of 1997 today to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are covered for necessary transport for emergency treatment. 
I am deeply concerned that Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas have a difficult time gaining access to emergency care, and there are relatively few hospitals in these areas, and patients must often travel a great distance to reach them. The Medicare ambulance transport reimbursement regulations have not kept pace with changes in the health care system that have occurred as a result of efforts to improve care while decreasing the cost of care. 
In many locales, clinics and ambulatory surgery centers staffed by physicians have developed the ability to provide routine emergency care. The local physicians are often available at the clinic, which has facilities and capability for emergency treatment. In fact, patients who are transported to the hospital emergency department during the day wait longer to see a physician than those at the clinic, as the physician must travel from the clinic to the hospital in order to see the patient. 
It is often necessary for seniors who are experiencing a medical emergency to be transported via an ambulance. Under current regulation, seniors who require ambulance transport to an emergency care facility must be taken to a hospital. Therefore, the senior is left with a difficult choice: be transported to the hospital facility, which may take longer and is likely to involve a longer waiting time for emergency care, or be transported to a local facility that provides emergency care to other citizens, and pay for the ambulance transport out of pocket. Neither of these is an optimal choice. 
As the reimbursement policy stands now, patients are required to use a more expensive facility when it may not be necessary. It would seem that allowing reimbursement for transport to nonhospital facilities that provide emergency care could result in fiscal savings in that the cost of ambulance transport combined with a clinic visit bill would be less than that of ambulance transport and a hospital emergency department bill. In addition, it would allow our senior citizens to have a health care benefit that is available to other members of the community. 
Concerns that might arise about the medical necessity of transporting certain patients to a hospital emergency department can and should continue to be addressed by local and regional emergency medical service systems, based on levels of care that are available in the area. These systems set standards and protocols for emergency medical service providers and work with the health care community in developing protocols for transport and patient care. 
Mr. President, I remain concerned about providing all of our citizens with an adequate level of health care. Our seniors need to be able to avail themselves of expeditious emergency care, without having to worry about how transport for this care will be paid for. The Ambulance Services Act of 1997 will go a long way toward this goal.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me first of all thank my colleague from Utah for his remarks. He has been a real leader on this. He is tenacious; he never, never gives up. I have tremendous respect for his work as a Senator, even though we are in profound disagreement on this question. But I would like to thank him for kind of matching what he does on the floor of the Senate with the kind of words he speaks.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me read this amendment slowly and carefully, because I am hoping to get a very strong vote in favor of this amendment, and I hope it will be an up-or-down vote. This is a pretty important matter amending the Constitution, and if this is going to be done--it may or may not be done--we better do it well, we better do it carefully. 
This amendment says: 
It is the policy of the United States that, in achieving a balanced budget, Federal outlays must not be reduced in a manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition, and health programs for poor children. 
What this amendment is saying, and I will give plenty of historical and economic context for it, is that we should go on record and make it very clear that if, in fact, this constitutional amendment to balance the budget is passed, which then locks us into this goal, will make the commitment that we are not going to, as we did in the last Congress, disproportionately cut programs that affect, quite often dramatically, the nutritional or health or educational status of poor children in America. 
The reason that I offer this amendment is that I think we need to have some focus on this question. There can be arguments made, and there have been, on whether or not we ought to amend the Constitution. There can be arguments made about whether or not this is a mistake vis-a-vis our fiscal and monetary policy to make sure recessions don't become depressions. There are arguments both ways. 
Senator Durbin has an amendment on the floor that says, look, if we need to move forward with an economic plan that puts the budget out of balance during a downturn in the economy, it should just be a requirement of a majority vote. I think that amendment is on the mark. 
I see the budgets over the years. There could be an argument of whom to blame. I wasn't here during the decade of the eighties or prior to that time. We can argue it both ways. I think historians are going to write about a piece of legislation which was euphemistically called the Economic Recovery Act which dramatically cut tax rates. I think it became rather regressive, because most benefits went to higher income citizens, at the same time of dramatically increased expenditures in the Pentagon. I think President Bush once called it voodoo economics. All of it was to lead to economic growth. People would have more money with a tax cut, productivity, jobs. It would lead to eliminating the debt. Actually, quite the opposite happened. 
That was actually borrowed money and borrowed time. It was politics of illusion. I really appreciate the focus of Senator Hatch on no longer having that illusion and the message from the people in the country that we should get our economic house in order and our political house in order. But what I am asking Senators to do, because I think we really owe it to the people we represent, is to make a commitment that one more time, as we go about achieving a balanced budget, Federal outlays must not be reduced in a manner which disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition and health care programs for poor children. 
I hope this amendment will not be tabled. I offer this amendment with passion and with commitment to a matter that I think is very important. I think there should be an up-or-down vote, and I hope it will be adopted. 
Mr. President, why the amendment? Well, because of recent history. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a report entitled `Bearing Most of the Burden: How Deficit Reduction During the 104th Congress Concentrated on Programs for the Poor.' I will just read a few of their conclusions: 
More than 93 percent of the budget reductions in entitlements have come from programs for low-income people. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that legislation enacted during the 104th Congress reduced entitlement programs by $65.6 billion from 1996 to 2002. Of that, almost $61 billion out of the $65.6 billion comes 
out of low-income entitlement programs, the largest reductions in the supplemental security income program and programs for the elderly and the poor. 
Please remember, I say to my colleagues, that one out of every five children in America today is poor. Mr. President, I read an article the other day with great interest of how you, as the Senator from Missouri, have teamed up with other Senators, like Senator Coats, and you have your own commitments to really not turning our gaze away from the concerns and circumstances of one out of every seven Americans, many of them children, but you are committed to doing something. 
We might have different ideas of what to do. I think that is commendable, and I know you well enough to know that you have that commitment. What I am worried about is deficit reduction based on the path of least political resistance, because I think that is exactly what we did in the last Congress. That is to say, we are afraid to take on powerful interests, so, instead, what we do is we go after the people who are not the heavy hitters, who are not the big givers, who are not well connected, and those people, all too often, in the Senate are voiceless and they are faceless and they are powerless and they are disproportionately poor children in America. 
I hope my colleagues will at least support this amendment. If this passes, it happens one time. Let's get it right. If we are going to lock ourselves into balancing the budget and deficit reduction, let's lock ourselves into humane and fair priorities that we are not going to disproportionately cut programs that affect the educational and nutritional and health care status of children. 
Mr. President, other than entitlements, 34 percent of the reduction in nondefense programs that are not entitlements came from nonentitlement programs for people with low incomes. Those low-income people programs accounted for only 21 percent of overall funding, but they were disproportionately cut as well. 
Just looking at the 104th Congress, I offer this amendment to make sure that we make a commitment that we are not going to cut such vital programs. Sometimes we are just too generous with the suffering of others. Let's not be too generous with the suffering of poor children in America. 
The Concord coalition had this to say. Martha Phillips the executive director, on November 26, 1996:  
Balancing the Federal budget-- 
And this has been a goal of the Concord coalition-- and keeping it in balance is critically important, but balance ought not to be achieved principally on the backs of the poor. Every program should be on the budget cutting table. No programs, groups or special interests should be exempt or get a free ride when the budget is being balanced. But neither should the needy be singled out to bear a disproportionate share of the load. 
They go on to say--this is the Concord coalition, I say to my colleagues, committed to deficit reduction. The Concord coalition goes on to say, under the able leadership of Senator Rudman and Senator Tsongas, who passed away--a real loss for our country--the Concord coalition goes on to say: 
Even though the 104th Congress, which passed the laws, and the President, who signed them, did not plan to target deficit reduction efforts on programs affecting low income people, that was nevertheless the result of both actions that were taken and those that were not.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is another interesting statement from the Committee on Economic Development. By the way, I would like to congratulate the business community in our country. The Committee on Economic Development over and over and over again, over the last several years, have said, from the point of view of economic performance for our Nation, we must invest in the health, skills and intellectual character of our children. We must do that. 
I quote, as a part of a letter that was written November 26, 1996, by the senior vice president and director of research of the Committee on Economic Development: 
Second, in an unfortunate surrender to misplaced ideology and political opportunism, our leaders in both political parties have increased the magnitude of the financing problem by insisting that tax reductions be included in their balanced budget plans. 
That was their view. By the way, I think we are going to have to look very closely at some of those budget proposals. My understanding is the Joint Tax Committee, in projecting the majority party's tax cuts over the next 10 years, has identified close to $500 billion in the first 5 years more targeted toward middle-income people and the second 5 years more targeted toward wealthy, high-income people. 
What is going to be the offset? Cuts in the nutritional and educational and health care programs for poor children in America? If that was the case, that would be unconscionable. If there was some sort of budget deal that leaves these children out in the cold, that would be unconscionable. 
The senior vice president of the Committee on Economic Development goes on to say: 
Third, as a result of the fiscal pressures created by these two factors, the burden of budget austerity has fallen disproportionately on those parts of the budget, and those parts of society, that offer the least political resistance. 
Actually, I have been saying that over and over again. I guess we are in agreement. I am pleased to hear them actually state it that way. 
For the budget that means that the discretionary annually appropriated programs, including those public investment activities for a society--it quite simply means the poor. 
Now the quote: 
As David Stockman observed a decade ago, politics triumphs over policy in seeking out weak clients rather than weak claims. 
This amendment asks us not to let politics triumph over policy. This amendment asks us to seek out the weak claims, not the weak clients. 
This amendment says we go on record that when we balance the budget, we will not cut disproportionately those programs that affect the health care, nutritional and educational status of poor children. We ought to have 100 Senators voting for that. We can go forward to balance the budget. We can go forward with deficit reduction. But given the way we did it in the last Congress, and the evidence, I must say to my colleagues, it is irreducible and irrefutable that we ought to at least make this commitment. 
Mr. President, the Washington Post in an editorial written today had this to say: 
The balanced budget debate is only in part what it purports to be--an argument over the deficit, savings, growth, and the shifting of cost to the next generation. It is also a sharp debate over social policy, conducted in fiscal code. If you decide to balance the budget, the question immediately becomes, at whose expense? The budget is by its very nature a redistributive device. On balance, it tends to move money from people who are better off to those who are not. If you narrow the deficit, will it end up doing more of that, less or about the same? 
This editorial goes on to make the argument that if we are going to do it, we ought to do it on the basis of a standard of fairness. We did not do that in the 104th Congress. 
This amendment asks the U.S. Senate, in the 105th Congress, Democrats and Republicans, to go on record that if we are going to balance the budget, we are not going to do it on the basis of the path of least political resistance and not going to go after weak clients. We are going to go after weak claims. And we are not going to end up passing budgets that disproportionately cut programs that affect the health, nutritional and educational status of poor children in America. 
If I were to get 100 votes, I would feel like I have died and gone to Heaven. I really would. I am so hopeful that my colleagues will vote for this amendment. 
Mr. President, in an interesting poll result, the Committee for Education Funding points out that whereas there is support for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget--and there is. I have been opposed to it. You have to ultimately follow your conviction and vote for what you think is right or wrong. Senator Hatch clearly takes another position, and he votes his conviction. No one would ever say otherwise. 
But it is interesting that public opinion polls show--according to the Committee for Education Funding--that 90 percent of Americans support maintaining or increasing Federal support for education. When directly asked if they would support a balanced budget constitutional amendment that reduces funds for education, nearly 70 percent disagreed. So this amendment just asks us to be clear about how we intend to do this. 
Mr. President, just a little bit more context. I am going to get a chance to speak on this amendment today, and then I guess we will go back to the Durbin amendment and tomorrow get a chance to speak and then have a vote. 
We are, as I said the other day on the floor of the Senate, in many varied ways a model for much of the world. I mean, we should be so proud of our country, the diversity of our country, so proud of our economic performance, so proud of our leadership in the world, so proud, I think, of really helping to create a world where we no longer have to think so much about a nuclear war that could be the end for our children and grandchildren. But there is at least one way in which we are not a model, one area in which I think in recent years we have been moving in the wrong direction. And that is in fulfilling our national vow of equal opportunity. That kind of national commitment is in need of refurbishing and renewal. 
I bring this amendment to the floor because more than 35 million Americans are poor. That is one out of every seven citizens. In 1994, of poor children under the age of 6, nearly half lived in families below half the poverty line. That figure has doubled over 20 years. The number of people who work and are poor and work full time, 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, and still are poor has dramatically increased as well. 
Mr. President, minorities are poorer than the rest of Americans. African-Americans are close to 30 percent, Hispanics at a little over 30 percent, and female-headed households are even poorer, and 44.6 percent of the children who live in such families are poor. In 1994, almost half of all children who were poor in America lived in female-headed households. So what we have here is one out of every five children poor, but it is getting closer to one out of every four children. One out of every two children of color are poor. Unfortunately, we cannot turn our gaze away from this reality, a strong convergence between poverty and race and gender and children in America. 
I am asking us to go on record to be for fairness in how we do this deficit reduction. 
Mr. President, let me give a few examples of the kinds of programs that I am talking about when I say that we should go on record that we will not disproportionately cut these programs that affect the nutritional health and educational status of children. 
Let me start out with the Women, Infants, and Children Program. Let me make a point with my colleagues, because sometimes I am going to give a lot of examples. I am going to talk about women and children. I want to translate these statistics into personal terms. 
But, first, as a teacher, I think I have said it before on the floor of the Senate, but I want to say it again. I was a college teacher for over 20 years. I have been in a school in Minnesota probably about every 2 weeks ever since I was elected. It is just crystal clear to me that the most important educational program in the United States of America--you know we talk about higher education. I was a college teacher. It is a big issue. It cuts across affordable higher education, cuts across a broad section of the population that people are very focused on, and it should be. 
But as a matter of fact, I think the most important educational program is to make sure that every women who is expecting a child has an adequate diet, rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein. It is just a fact. It is just a fact. The evidence is irreducible and irrefutable and it is medical evidence. If we do not make sure that every woman carrying a child has an adequate diet, all too often her child will be born severely underweight, her child will be born with an impairment that may mean that no matter what we do in our public schools, that child will never have the same chance as probably all of our children, Senators' children, or grandchildren. It is the essence of the American dream. It is the goodness of our country, for us to say that every child, no matter what race or gender or income of family, will have the same opportunity to reach her full potential or his full potential. 
That is what my father, who was a Jewish immigrant from Russia, taught me about our country. That is the greatness of our country. It is not too much for me to ask my colleagues to go on record that in balancing the budget we will not make any cuts in the most important educational program, the Women, Infants, and Children Program. 
In 1996, Mr. President, WIC provided assistance for 7.2 million women, infants, and children. That was about 60 percent of the eligible population. There are about 11 million women and children that are eligible. So, some women and some infants and some children are left behind. 
Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about the WIC Program. It was established as a pilot program in 1972 and it was made permanent in 1974. It is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Who is eligible? Pregnant or postpartum women, infants, and children up to the age of 5 are eligible. Mr. President, how many people does it serve? More than 7 million people get WIC benefits every month, and participation has risen steadily. Children are the largest category of WIC recipients. Of the average 6.89 million people who received WIC benefits each month, 3.5 million were children, 1.8 million were infants, and 1.6 million were women. 
Mr. President, this is a program that is a huge priority or should be a huge priority for this Senate. It is a success story. Sometimes we harp on the complexity of it all like we do not know what to do. I am in agreement with every single Senator that says some of these Government programs ought to be reevaluated, some of them do not work well. But from the point of view of decency, of fairness, of justice, of saving money--what is the figure? For every $1 we invest in the Women, Infants, and Children Program, it is $3 less we spend in medical assistance later on. 
WIC is a huge success story. The Women, Infants, and Children Program reduces fetal deaths and infant mortality. WIC reduces low birth rates and increases the duration of pregnancy. WIC improves the growth of at-risk infants and children. WIC decreases the incidence of iron deficiency anemia in children, improves the dietary intake of pregnant and postpartum women, and improves weight gain in pregnant women. Pregnant women participating in the Women, Infants, and Children Program receive prenatal care earlier. I think, Mr. President, about every 2 minutes in America a child is born to a woman who had no prenatal care. Children enrolled in WIC are more likely to have a regular source of medical care and are better immunized. Children who receive WIC benefits demonstrate superior cognitive development. WIC significantly improves children's diet. WIC is cost effective. 
I am just asking my colleagues to make a commitment that we will not disproportionately cut this program as we move forward to balance the budget because in the last Congress we disproportionately made cuts in programs that affected those citizens who did not have the political clout here, who did not give the big dollars, who are not the heavy hitters, who are not the well connected. This is a distorted priority if we at least do not make a commitment on behalf of these children. 
Mr. President, I will give some examples from the Women, Infants, and Children Program, but I want to first of all call attention to my colleagues to a special report in Time magazine February 3, 1997, `How a Child's Brain Develops and What It Means for Child Care Welfare Reform.' Mr. President, I congratulate Time magazine for this issue. I really believe that we will see major change in how we think about our priorities here as a result of the kind of research that Time magazine reports on. Basically, if I had to summarize this whole issue, the conclusion is as follows: If you do not make sure that women expecting a child have an adequate diet, if you do not make a commitment to these children when they are young, if you do not make sure that they do not have not only adequate nutrition and adequate health care, but if you do not make sure that they do not have intellectual stimulation, a nurturing and caring environment--and by the way, Government cannot do all of that. The President knows that. Much of that is 
up to the family. If you do not make sure that that does not happen, then by age 3 for many of these children, it is almost close to all over; certainly by age 5. 
I think that what we are going to see and more of the concern that will come out, and it will be compelling, if we do not make the investment, if we do not do everything to make good things happen at the local and community level, and realizing people need resources to make sure that for these children we invest in the intellect and the character of these children, or many of them will therefore not make it. What a waste that would be for our Nation. 
Mr. President, I have said before on the floor of the Senate and today is my day to try and give this context because I think so much of politics is personal, I have learned so much as a grandfather. Because our children are all older and we had our children when we were very young, I forget what it was like. Now when we have the grandchildren over, I have said on the floor of the Senate before, you take a 2-year-old and you watch him or I watch our granddaughter, it is amazing. Being in the same room, in the same house, and every 15 seconds they find something interesting and new. The President is smiling. He may have seen the same thing. What is going on is that these small children are experiencing all the unnamed magic of the world that is before them. We ought to ignite that spark for all of our children. We do not want to pour cold water on that spark, and we have, for too many children. Actually, it does not make much of a difference whether it is my grandchildren or anyone else's grandchildren, they are all God's children. I think it is time for us to move beyond symbolic politics and it is time to stop giving the speech and having the photo opportunities next to the small children unless we are willing to make an investment. 
Mr. President, at 23 years old, Elaine became pregnant and soon after she was laid off of her $9 an hour office job. Since she was pregnant she had difficulty finding another job. She did find one at $6 an hour. With little resources, she immediately learned about the Women, Infants, and Children Program which she says is the reason her baby was born healthy and strong. Her initial guidance from the WIC office in Reno, NV, taught her the basic nutritional information. I am just reading from this example. We have collected stories from people around the country. All too often we just speak in statistics here, or strategy or tactics. I want to try and translate this amendment into personal terms as it affects people's lives. Every month Elaine attended nutritional classes and received vouchers for items like milk, cheese, peanut butter, and beans. She said, `I had no idea what I was supposed to eat and what was right for my baby. The public nurses were all so nice and helpful, I never felt bad. They wanted me to have a healthy baby as much as I did. I knew nothing about babies, like breast feeding and stuff. They taught me all that.' After Elaine gave birth to a healthy boy, she would take him to the WIC clinic where he was examined. 
The same nurses who guided her through the pregnancies guided her through the initial steps of child rearing. Not only did she learn the basics of taking care of her son, but she continued to receive financial assistance. Says Elaine, `The formula cost $160 a month and I did not have it. WIC gave it to me, and I'm not sure what I would have done without that help.' 
Eventually, Mr. President, Elaine returned to her office job at a rate of $9.60 an hour, and she was no longer eligible for WIC, and she should not have been. She now lives independently with her son. `WIC saved me. I really don't know how I would have survived. It helped me survive on an emotional level and with finances. I was really surprised. I always thought these kinds of programs were for `low-lifes,' but they were a lot like me. I just had hard luck and needed help. I got it.' And Elaine's son got it. That is the difference between Elaine's son having a really what we would call successful and full life versus what might have happened to her son if she had not received this assistance. 
Is it too much for me to ask colleagues to go on record that we will not disproportionately cut the Women, Infants, and Children Program? Really, we should not cut it at all. This amendment doesn't even ask us to do that. Actually, we ought to fully fund it now. I don't understand some of these proposals here in Washington--some from the White House. When we don't actually fully fund some of these programs, I don't know exactly how we figure out which children go without health care, which children go without the nutritional help they need, which children are not in the Head Start programs. Who makes that decision? We know how we can make a difference and be helpful. We have some proven, credible programs that have worked, that are key to children, key to what we are about as a country. I am just saying, let us at least make a commitment that these programs are not the programs that we disproportionately cut. 
Mr. President, let me now move on and talk about the Head Start Program. Mr. President, the Head Start Program is a program that began, as I remember, back in 1965, or thereabouts. It is a program which, in many ways, is not perfect, but it has lived up to its title, which is that we do, as a Nation, just what the program says; we give children from some really difficult and tough circumstances, from low-income families, a head start. That is the goodness of America, what we are about. Yet, Mr. President, in 1996, the Head Start Program reached only 17 percent of eligible 3-year-olds and only 41 percent of eligible 4-year-olds. In the United States, almost 4 million children are eligible for Head Start, because children 1 and 2 could be receiving or participating in this program. But it served just over 800,000 of those over 4 million children. Roughly, 3.2 million children are not being served. 
The President's budget proposal says we will, by 2000, 2001, fund Head Start for another 1 million children. I still don't understand how we can make the collective decision not to fully fund it. How do we explain to people in the country, or more important, how do we explain to children? 
Jonathan Kozol--and I recommend Jonathan's work--wrote a book called `Amazing Grace: Poor Children and the Conscience of America.' He wrote another book called `Savage Inequalities: Public Education in America.' His writing is so powerful. In an article he recently wrote for a journal called Tikun, a very interesting journal, he writes at the end:  
Millions of children in sequestered neighborhoods, like the South Bronx, do not know what they have the right to hope for. Their eyes ask questions that you and I and all of us have yet to answer. 
Their eyes ask questions that, as Senators, we have not answered. One of those questions is, how can a country, how can a Congress, that purports to love children do so precious little to help some of the children that are the most vulnerable citizens with the direst need? 
Mr. President, across the freeway from the comforts of 
Disneyland is a housing division, a stone's throw from the lavish and affluent hotels that serve tourists. In a corner apartment lives Rene, a lively, exuberant, and bright 8-year-old. She is in the second grade where she is doing well in school. In fact, every morning Rene runs to school excited to learn. Too many of our children are running into the arms of police, rather than into the arms of parents and teachers. 
We pay a price for not investing in our children. We pay a price for not investing in poor children in America. Rene attended two years of Head Start, which, according to her mother, was `a Godsend.' At Head Start, Rene learned the fundamentals of schools, such as her colors, the alphabet, and writing her name. More importantly, Rene and her family learned about school. For Rene, learning about school at Head Start meant more than academics. It meant her mother learned about nutrition and eating right. It meant her mother learned how to interact with and talk to teachers. Her mother learned how to prepare Rene for school, things like clean clothes and breakfast. It meant her mother learned about reading to Rene. It meant her mother learned that Rene needed a structure, a set time to eat dinner and to go to bed. Head Start taught this. Learning about school meant Rene learned to interact with her peers. She learned about sharing. She learned how to listen, how to take directions. Rene learned about curling up and being read to. She even learned to brush her teeth. Rene, Mr. President, represents one of the many children who have benefited from Head Start. Said her mother, `Before Rene got in this program, I knew nothing about what she needed. I was kind of scared for her to go to school. I didn't do so good in school, and I was getting ready for the same with her. Her teachers cared about her and me. They wanted to work with us, too. I knew they cared.' 
Remember, Mr. President, that the Head Start teachers who did so much for Rene and began her on the path to school success earn about $17,000 a year. Also, keep in mind that for every Rene that benefited in Head Start, two are turned away. For every Rene that benefited in Head Start, two are turned away. 
I am asking Senators to make a commitment with this amendment, in an up-or-down vote, that we will not, in balancing this budget, disproportionately cut programs that affect the educational, health care, or nutritional status of children. WIC is one example, and the Head Start Program is another. I don't think that is too much to ask. 
Marcus, a shy and quiet first-grader, finds himself in the principal's office for the third time in a week. According to his teacher, Marcus is either overagitated, annoying other students in class, or else listless and disinterested in the tasks at hand. Marcus usually doesn't understand what is happening in class. He does not yet know all of his colors, his numbers, or the alphabet.  
Though many of his classmates attended a Head Start Program and learned the initial steps toward understanding school and learning, Marcus did not. He represents one of the 1.2 million children who, though eligible, could not participate in the Head Start Program. 
Mr. President, in Minnesota, my State, only 40 percent of the children who are eligible for Head Start have access to it. In other States it is much lower. 
The program near his home was full. Not only was it full but there was a year waiting list when Marcus' grandmother tried to sign him up. Though there was room in another program, it was too far for his grandmother to take him. Instead, Marcus stayed home, sometimes alone, while his grandmother worked. Marcus is conspicuously behind his classmates. While his classmates scurry around the teacher to be read to, he had not yet held a book or had ever been read to. Marcus does not even know how to write his name. 
Let me pick up on that. 
He had not held a book, and he had never been read to. Why don't we go on record, in all of this haste to balance the budget, that we will not balance the budget on the backs of poor children, and we will not make cuts which would make it impossible for a child like Marcus to have a book read to him in a Head Start Program? 
There are a lot of homes that do not have any books at all. I read somewhere that one of the factors that most explains how well children do in school is the number of books that are in the home. Mr. President, there are many homes where the parent or parents can't afford any books. I would just suggest to my colleagues that one of the most important things we could ever do is to make sure that children have access to those books or that someone can read those books and nurture those children and stimulate those children. 
Peter Hutchinson, superintendent of schools in Minneapolis, made an excellent suggestion that I am going to try out speaking at the legislature next week speaking about children. Peter Hutchinson, Mr. President, said something that I think is appealing to you; a wonderful voluntary effort. He said, `You know, Paul * * *' and he has two teenagers--`we have all of these wonderful children's books in the home but the children are older now. Why don't we get those books in the other child's home? Let us get those books out of our homes. Let's get bookmobiles and get them into the homes of those children. And let us get them to those Head Start Programs and make sure that all of our children get that stimulation.' 
That is what I am talking about today. 
Marcus did not know how to write his name nor did he know how to recite the alphabet. In a phrase, Marcus is not a part of the culture of the school. He did not come to school ready to learn. Marcus' teacher is concerned and anxious about him. He is far behind his classmates, and she has little, if any, time to help him catch up. As weeks progress, he falls further behind and is more frustrated. Already Marcus hates school and learning, counting the days until summer vacation. He knows he is different. He knows he does not understand but also knows there is not much he can do. 
Here is a child who is utterly defeated. I meet children. I travel the State. I travel the country and I meet with children who are age 10, age 8, who can't look me in the face, who look down. They have no confidence. They don't believe they are going to be teachers. They don't believe they are going to be doctors. They don't believe they are going to be successful business people. They don't believe they are going to be lawyers. They don't believe they are going to be architects. They don't believe they are ever going to be Senators or Representatives. None believe they will ever be President. They have none of that hope. It is gone. 
Can't we make a commitment as a Senate knowing full well the 
importance of family and community? But can't we at least get some resources for the communities and neighborhoods and families so that we can support our children? 
I will tell you something. I am absolutely convinced that when historians write about this time period of the decade of the 1980's moving into the decade of the 1990's, the ultimate indictment of our country will be the way in which we have abandoned our children and devalued the work of adults who work with those children. Think about it for a moment. 
I am not off the topic. I love to take my grandchildren to the zoo. But if you work at the zoo, you get paid twice the salary, twice the wage, that a woman or a man makes working in a child care center. We pay people who work for the zoo twice as much money as we pay men and women who work with children. What in the world does that say? 
When I was a teacher at Carleton College in Northfield, MN, I would meet students, and they would say, `In all due respect, we do not want to be college teachers. We want to work with these children when they are young, 1, 2, 3, or 4 years of age, because we know that is such a critical time.' But many of them would then go on and say, `But we can't. We can't support the family. We would make $6 an hour with no health care benefits.' 
What are we saying? Let us dig into our pockets. Let us not spend money on wasteful programs. Let us cut. Let us balance the budget. Let us be fiscally responsible. But, please, let us make a commitment with this amendment that we are not going to balance the budget on the backs of poor children. Please let us invest in certain areas of life in America, starting with our children. 
Marcus' teacher said: 
I just don't know what could be done for him. I know that he needs a lot of one-on-one attention and love, but I just do not have the time or the resources. Every day I feel him slipping, and, frankly, it breaks my heart. He is a good boy and a smart boy. I feel as if he is being punished for what we did not do for him. I am worried that he will always hate school and suffer until he can leave. He tries so hard. Sometimes I want to cry. 
That is what this debate is all about. It is about people. It is about children. 
I say to my colleague from Utah that I really believe there can be 100 Senators voting for this. I am not bringing this amendment to the floor because I want to point the finger at other colleagues. I am not bringing this amendment to the floor to force an embarrassing vote. I am bringing this amendment to the floor in good faith and in good conscience really hoping that my colleagues will support it because, otherwise, I will just tell you, given our track record of deficit reduction based on the path of least political resistance, we are, with this constitutional amendment to balance the budget, going to lock ourselves into very stoic priorities, and we will make these cuts, and I believe in the absence of some commitment, we will make cuts in these very programs that affect these very children.  
By August of 1996, in West Monroe, Louisiana, there was already a waiting list for Head Start for August 1997. Zora Cheney has been a Head Start teacher there since 1965. She was there at the very beginning. Not only does she see the need for it, but she lives the success. According to Zora, without Head Start the lives of many children would be in words `a disaster.' 
I visit Head Start programs all across Minnesota. Another outstanding feature is parental participation--high-participation parents--in meeting with the teachers and in talking about the children. This program is a really important investment in poor children. 
We get kids here, so many kids here, that need us and would not endure later school years without it. I have seen some kids who come in, and it is obvious they are not cared for enough and that the home family needs help. While Zora's program emphasizes the traditional things that we discuss with Head Start, like building on language, learning shapes and colors and developing social skills, it does so much more. Says Zora, `We are concerned with everything about that child. We want the parents to learn how to feed them, how to dress them, how to parent them.' She continued, `I have had children come to school, and I know they have been sleeping on the floor. I know they need so much at home. We work with other groups. We refer the families to get things like furniture and doctor appointments.' When asked the most significant contribution that Head Start in West Monroe, Louisiana has made to the community Zora replies, `For many its the first place that they feel safe.' 
I have other examples that I will go through tomorrow, but I just wanted to give some examples of some children, and I am going to be doing this over and over and over again, actually thanks to the people in Minnesota--I am just going to bring to the floor of the Senate the lives of children so that we can get some votes on their behalf because I will tell you something. For example, the Senator from Utah--and this is not meant to challenge him--on these children's issues he is effective and he is a powerful Senator for children. I know that. So I do not feel like I am spitting in the wind when I come out here to speak or I do not think I make a mistake with this amendment. I am just trying to get my colleagues to make this commitment because I know so many of them care so deeply about children. 
The amendment says we make a commitment that we will not put into effect disproportionate cuts in programs that affect education--I talked about that--nutritional and health care programs for children. 
According to the Childrens Defense Fund, 10 million children, one in seven children in America, are without any health care coverage at all, and I think that close to about a million children a year have been dropped from coverage because actually more and more people are getting dropped from employment-based coverage, or what has happened, employers will cover the adult but they do not cover the children. 
It used to be that people could get coverage for everyone in their family. Who are these 10 million uninsured children? Nine in ten, 88 percent, have parents who work. Nearly two in three, 64 percent have parents who work full time. These are children of working poor families. More than three in four, 77 percent, are white. Sometimes we do a little bit too much by way of stereotyping and always assume we are talking about African American people or Hispanics. Two-thirds live in families with income above the poverty level, and more than three in five, 61 percent, live in two-parent families. Each year since 1989--this was the statistic I was struggling for--900,000 fewer children on the average have received private coverage. 
I think actually it is real important for me to make this point about what this amendment is talking about and also some of the legislative initiatives that will be taken in this Senate in the 105th Congress. We are talking about working poor families. We are talking about people who are not old enough for Medicare, and even if, by the way, you receive Medicare in my State of Minnesota people do not have prescription drug costs covered and elderly people still live in terror of catastrophic expenses if they are no longer to stay at home and the nursing home costs, or we are talking about families that are not poor enough to qualify for medical assistance. They fall between the cracks. They work, they work hard, they are barely above the poverty-level income and they are not fortunate enough to have an employer that provides them with health care coverage. So their children are at risk. These families live paycheck to paycheck. 
What does this translate into? More than half of uninsured children with asthma never see the doctor during the year. More than half of uninsured children with asthma never see the doctor during the year. Many of these asthmatic children are hospitalized with problems that could have been prevented. One-third of uninsured children with recurring ear infections never see the doctor. Many suffer permanent hearing loss. Children with untreated health problems are less likely to learn in school. If you have an ear infection, if you suffer permanent hearing loss, if you are not treated for asthma, if you do not have dental care, if you come to school with an infected tooth, with a tooth with an abscess and you cannot even get dental treatment, you are not likely to do as well in school. 
Mr. President, it will actually save money when we invest in children. Each dollar invested to immunize a child saves between 
$3.40 and, some say, $16 in direct medical costs, and it goes on and on. In every other advanced economy children get better health care coverage than in America. 
So, Mr. President, here we have children with undiagnosed vision problems who do not get glasses and do not even see the blackboard. We have children who suffer from asthma, we have children who have ear infections and can suffer hearing loss, we have children who are in pain and discomfort and have trouble concentrating, we have children who are not treated early for lead paint poisoning and these children can suffer permanent mental retardation, and we have 10 million children in America who are uninsured. 
Given this shameful statistic, is it too much to ask my colleagues to make the commitment that in our effort to balance the budget we are not going to make any disproportionate cuts that affect the health care status of poor children in America? We are not doing near enough right now. 
That is all this amendment does. I am fearful, on the basis of what we did in the last Congress, that when push comes to shove, we will not have a deficit reduction plan locked in by this constitutional amendment to balance the budget based upon a standard of fairness, that we will embark upon once again deficit reduction based upon the path of least political resistance, and those Americans who will disproportionately be asked to sacrifice are the very Americans who cannot tighten their belts any longer--poor children in America. This amendment goes to the very heart of who we are and what we are about. 
I do not know. My colleague from Utah may speak to this. Maybe there is a strategy on the other side--not the other side as if we are not friends, but we have majority party and minority party. I am in the minority party--to basically vote against all the amendments. I hope not. And one more time, I really hope that we will have an up-or-down vote on this amendment. I introduce this amendment with respect for colleagues. I think it speaks to a terribly important matter. I really hope that people will vote for it. I really believe most Senators agree that these are not the areas where we are going to make disproportionate cuts. I really think most Senators agree. 
Mr. President, I will speak more to this amendment, but for right now I yield the floor. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I know the Senator from Vermont wants to speak, and then I will, after the Senator from Vermont speaks, respond to some of my colleague's points. I don't understand, I will say to my friend from Utah, he talks about tabling the amendment because this is an orderly way to do it. I don't understand why an up-or-down, yes-or-no vote isn't just as orderly. What is the problem with an up-or-down vote as opposed to tabling? It is just as orderly. 
The second thing--I guess it is less a question, and I don't know if my colleague, who is a good friend, meant it in this way--I don't think this is a game. This is less a question than, I guess, a response. I don't think it's a game at all. I don't think it's a game to these children, and it is not a game to me. I just want to be clear about it. It is an amendment offered out of respect. It is an amendment that I believe is profoundly important for our country. It is an amendment I hope Senators will support. It is not a game. It is not a game.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, the answer is no, absolutely not, on the basis of what was attempted. Also on the basis of some of the cuts made in the last Congress, the evidence is quite to the contrary. The evidence is, in the absence of some assurance and some sort of commitment in spite of all the speeches made and words uttered, we will make disproportionate cuts in the programs that affect health, nutrition, and educational status of these children. 
If the Senator from Vermont would not mind if I go on briefly and respond to some of the comments made by my colleague, the Senator from Utah. First of all, sort of a clarification about how you define `disproportionate.' It is pretty simple. Again, the evidence, and I am interested if somebody wants to argue with it, in the last Congress 93 percent of the budget reductions in entitlements came from programs for low-income people. Madam President, 93 percent. All you need to do is figure out the percentage of the overall entitlement programs that are low income and you do not cut by more than that. 
We have the same thing with discretionary. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand what the amendment says. You cannot dance around it. Second, in all of the amendments we introduced and all the amendments that the majority party is introducing, in this whole constitutional amendment there will be implementing legislation to work out the final details. 
Third, Madam President, as to the Constitution and whether you can have policy in the Constitution, I am not a lawyer, but article III says:  
The judicial power of the United States, shall be invested in one supreme Court, in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which will not be diminished during their Continuance in Office. 
It certainly seems as if we have such policies in the Constitution right now. 
Madam President, what troubles me the most about the comments of my colleague from the Senator from Utah, first of all, he talks about this amendment giving an exemption. There is no exemption. This amendment just says give them what we did last time. Make a commitment that we will not disproportionately cut programs that vitally affect the nutritional, educational, and health care status of poor children in America. I gave examples of those programs in the way they work and what they mean to children. That is all it says and no more. Senators should be clear on what they are voting on. 
Finally, Madam President, and I want to be clear if I could get the attention of my colleague from Utah, I do not want him to think I say this without giving him a chance to respond, but in all due respect to my good friend from Utah, when we talk about bringing the deficit down and real interest rates down, and that is the way to help children, a lot of the children that I have talked about, Senator, do not have that future. If we do not make a commitment that we will make sure that they have adequate diet, adequate nutrition, that they come to school prepared to learn, that they come to school in good health, they are not going to have this future. 
For gosh sake, we should not in the name of deficit reduction savage poor children in America today. You do not want an up-or-down vote? You will vote to table. Fine. But this amendment is substantive. It speaks to the very real problem of the deficit reduction based on the path of least political resistance, picking out the most vulnerable citizens. If we do not make a commitment that we are not going to cut these programs that are so vital to poor children's lives--as a matter of fact, we should be investing much more--then these children do not have a future. 
Deficit reduction, I am all for. Balancing the budget, we should do it. But instead of focusing on poor children in America, why do we not focus on the subsidies that go to oil companies, tobacco companies, pharmaceutical, big insurance companies, and a whole lot of other corporate welfare? Why do we not focus on the $17 billion over 2 years more than the Pentagon requested wanted for the Pentagon? There are other places to make the cuts, but I say to my colleague from Utah, and I am sorry to say with indignation, this is anything but an abstraction to the children I am talking about. 
Your argument about how the best thing for these children is to make sure we balance the budget because real interest rates will come down--by the way, the Federal Reserve ought to bring the real interest rates down right now if everybody is right, I am not sure they are about the Consumer Price Index having overstated inflation, what in the world are we talking about even the possibility of real interest rates going up? They ought to be going down. Above and beyond that point, it does not do the children that I am talking about today one bit of good to talk about balancing the budget in the future when you balance the budget on their backs. That is what we did the last Congress. That is what we did the last Congress. 
I am just saying, Senators, we should do this on the basis of some standard of fairness. I still think I can get 100 votes for this. I hope the Senator from Utah tomorrow, after we have a little bit more time for final debate, will not move to table this. I hope he will support it. With all due respect, the evidence does not suggest that with the absence of this assurance we will not make these cuts in exactly these decisive areas of life that so crucially affect the quality, or if we do not make this commitment, the lack of quality of the lives of poor children in America. I yield the floor.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the memory of a fine young person from Minnesota, Amy Nicolle Johnson. 
Amy Johnson grew up at her family's home on Lake Sarah and attended the Rockford public schools from kindergarten through her senior year of high school. At age 17, Amy died in a car accident early one morning on her way to the school she loved. 
An excellent student, talented athlete, and student leader, Amy was extensively involved in diverse activities throughout the year. A typical school year began for Amy with a class schedule that included band and choir in addition to the traditional academic subjects. 
Her 6-year commitment to band was most demanding in the autumn with extra practices for the flag corps of the marching band and many evenings devoted to playing the trumpet with the pep band. She also played volley ball for 5 years, 3 of which were spent on the varsity team. 
Gymnastics marked the beginning of the winter season for her. Competing on all four events for all of her 5 years and a varsity team member for 4, Amy's involvement in this sport exemplified the pride, perseverance, and commitment that she applied to every facet of her life. 
She enjoyed singing with the choir and participated in choral duets and the stage--jazz--band for several years in district and State competitions. Her musical talent and enjoyment of the dramatic arts led Amy to participate in musicals and plays. 
The spring brought Amy outdoors, where she played second base with the varsity softball team for 4 years. Even though the school year would come to an end each spring, the softball season continued into the summer. From the tee ball leagues in second grade to the State softball fast pitch tournament in 1995, Amy spent many hours of her summer vacation on the field. 
The past two summers she began saving money for college working at Len Busch Roses and the Hennepin County Baker Park Reserve on Lake Independence. 
Throughout all of the season's activities, Amy was a leader inside and outside of the classroom. She was an honors student and a member of the National Honor Society, as well as the secretary of her senior, junior, and freshman class. She was the cocaptain of the gymnastic and softball teams and was recognized in all three sports as an all-conference athlete. In her senior year she was chosen Homecoming Queen. 
Most of Amy's friends and teachers will remember her shining smile that simply defined her presence. It is her family's hope that this remarkable young woman's spirit will be perpetuated through a scholarship that was established in her memory. 
Amy valued respect, compassion, honesty, integrity, and responsibility. She made a sincere effort to live up to those values daily and she made a positive difference in the lives of all those she encountered. 
Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to the memory of this remarkable young woman, Amy Johnson, who touched the lives of so many during her brief life.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I won't make some of the arguments that have been made in opposition to this amendment. With all due respect to my colleagues, we can look back with a sense of history, and I think there is probably plenty of blame on both sides--I am glad to say I wasn't here during most of that history--about budgets that were not in balance. But the fact of the matter is, people in our country have made it really clear that they want to see us get our fiscal house in order. We can do that, we should do that, and we don't need this amendment. 
I do, in a moment, want to talk about who is at risk and exactly what kind of priorities I believe this amendment is going to lock us into, which I don't think are the priorities and values of people in our country.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as we turn our thoughts to the new century--and I have a different context about this debate--we can celebrate a great deal. The past 100 years have seen massive improvements in the quality of our national life, American leadership in getting the world past murderous global conflict and successful transcendence of economic crisis. 
Our population is more diverse than ever, and at midcentury, we dismantled the legal framework encasing our original sin of State-sanctioned racism. We are, in many varied ways, a model for much of the world. 
But there is at least one way in which we are not a model, one area in which in recent times we have been moving in the wrong direction. That is in fulfilling our national vow of equal opportunity. 
We said in 1776 that every American should have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In 1997, that national commitment is in need of refurbishing and renewal. Mr. President, I will explain in a moment why I start out with this context. 
More than 35 million Americans--1 out of every 7 of our fellow citizens--are officially poor. More than one out of every four children in our country today are poor. One out of every two children of color are poor in America today. And the poor are getting poorer. 
In 1994, of the poor children under the age of 6, nearly half lived in families with incomes below half the poverty line. That figure has doubled over the last 20 years, as has the number of people who work full time, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, and still are poor. 
Mr. President, minorities are poorer than the rest of Americans. African Americans are close to 30 percent and Hispanics at a little over 30 percent. And 44.6 percent of children who lived in families that are female-headed families were poor in 1994. Almost half of all children who were poor live in female-headed households. Women are disproportionately among the ranks of the poor in America. There is a convergence between race and gender and poverty and children. 
Mr. President, when I introduce my amendments in this debate that will ensue over the next couple of weeks, I am going to talk in very concrete terms about what it means to be poor in America. 
Context, Time magazine, `Special Report: How A Child's Brain Develops, And What It Means for Child Care and Welfare Reform.' This is startling. This is medical evidence that is irreducible and irrefutable, and the evidence says that the first 3 years are critical. We have to make sure that, first of all, women that are expecting children have an adequate diet. Otherwise, their children at birth may not have the opportunity and the chance that is the very essence of the American dream. And if children do not have an adequate diet during these early years, and decent health care, and children do not get a smart start and have nurturing care and stimulation by age 3, it may very well be that they will never be able to fully participate in the economic and political and social and cultural life of our Nation. 
What does this have to do with this debate? Let me be clear about who is at risk. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--by the way, Bob Greenstein and the work of this organization is impeccable. All of us on both sides of the aisle have a tremendous amount of respect for their work. 
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, more than 93 percent of the budget reductions in entitlement programs in the 104th Congress came from programs for low-income people. Congress reduced entitlement programs by $65.6 billion over the period from 1996 to 2002. Of that amount, $61 billion out of the $65 billion came out of low-income entitlement programs. Entitlement programs not targeted on low-income households were reduced only $4.6 billion--whether it was nutrition, whether it was health care, whether it was early childhood development. 
I will tell you what was interesting. Those citizens in this country who do not have the political power, who do not hire the lobbyists, who are not the heavy hitters--let me make a connection to campaign finance reform, who were not the big givers--they are the ones who disproportionately were asked to pay the price. 
We had deficit reduction--talking about how to balance the budget--based on the path of least political resistance. It was not the oil companies. It was not the pharmaceutical companies. It was not the big insurance companies. But it was children, disproportionately low-income citizens and disproportionately poor children in America. 
Mr. President, therefore, the first amendment that I am going to offer, which I think is a litmus test for all of us--I hope I will get support from the other side of the aisle--will read as follows: `This amendment would exempt outlays that would disproportionately affect nutrition, health care, and education programs.' 
Mr. President, this is an amendment that basically says that we want to make sure we would exempt outlays that would disproportionately affect the nutrition, health care, and educational programs and status of children. 
Mr. President, it is a simple amendment. We have been hearing speeches in which all of us have talked about education and children. We love to have photo opportunities with children. This amendment just says, `OK, if you're going to lock us in to a balanced budget, I think we need to get a commitment, based upon the record of the 104th Congress, that you are not going to make disproportionate cuts in programs that deal with the educational, health care, and nutritional status of children.' Everyone should vote yes for that. 
Let us go on record. Let us be clear that we are not going to target for cuts, we are not going to target for pain poor children in America, that we will not make those disproportionate cuts in nutritional programs for those children, in health care programs for those children, in educational programs and early childhood programs for those children. 
I think this amendment speaks to a very real concern that people have in this country. Exactly what is the agenda here? 
Mr. President, the second amendment--let me repeat the first amendment one more time: `Federal outlays shall not be reduced in a manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition, and health care programs for children.' 
That should be an amendment that I should get support on from both sides of the aisle. `Federal outlays shall not be reduced in a manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition, and health care programs for children.' 
Mr. President, the second amendment that I am going to offer is that `Funding for the Women, Infants, and Children Program shall be exempted from the definition of outlays for balanced budget calculations, thus protecting such spending from cuts under a balanced budget amendment.' 
Mr. President, it is pretty simple. The Women, Infants, and Children Program provided assistance in 1996 for 7.3 million women, infants, and children. However, it was only 60 percent of the eligible population, and 11 million mothers and children were eligible. Only 7.2 million were covered, leaving 4 million women, infants, and children vulnerable and not benefiting from the Women, Infants, and Children Program. 
We all know what the evidence suggests. And so my amendment just simply says, we will exempt that from the definition of outlays for balanced budget calculations, thus protecting this program. Are we going to protect it or not? I want to hear people tell me why we would not go on record saying we would protect it. 
The third amendment that I am going to lay out on the floor: `Funding for Head Start shall be exempted from the definition of outlays for balanced budget calculations, thus protecting such spending from cuts under the balanced budget amendment.' 
Mr. President, in 1996, Head Start served 796,500 children. According to the Census Bureau, there were roughly 2 million American children living in poverty. That leaves 1,200,000 children who were still unserved. 
This program, which gives children just what the title says it does, a head start, reached only 17 percent of eligible 3-year-olds and only 41 percent of eligible 4-year-olds. The medical evidence is in. These are the ages where we need to support these children. These children, just because they come from poor households, deserve every bit of support we can give them. 
This amendment lays itself on the line. If you are going to support this amendment to balance the budget and lock us in, then I want a commitment from this Senate that we will not target these children and we will not have cuts in this vital program that gives children a head start, some of the most vulnerable poor children in America. 
Finally, Mr. President, another amendment--and these are just four I am going to preview. `Funding for education shall be exempted from the definition of outlays for balanced budget calculations, thus protecting such spending from cuts under the balanced budget amendment.' 
I heard the President last night talking about education. I heard the President last night talking about early childhood development. Senators were on their feet applauding. So I am just saying since I saw what we did last Congress, I saw where we made the cuts, I want to hear Senators argue with me that, if there is another position here--almost all those cuts affected low-income citizens. Almost all those cuts affected poor children in America, the very citizens who do not get to the bargaining table, the very citizens who do not march on Washington, DC, the very citizens who do not have lobbyists. 
So I say to my colleagues who support this, how about giving me some reassurance and, more importantly, how about giving people in our country reassurance that when we do this we will make sure, one more time, that Federal outlays shall not be reduced in a manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition and health care programs for children; that we go on record that we are not going to cut benefits that deal with the Women, Infants, and Children Program; that we are going to make sure that a woman expecting a child has an adequate diet; that we are not going to make cuts in Head Start, we are going to make sure these children are given a head start; and we are not going to make cuts in educational programs. It is real simple. It is up-or-down votes. 
I want to know exactly where my colleagues want to take our country with this constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I want to know what the priorities are. I want to know where the cuts are going to be. My understanding, and I will talk much more about this when I bring the amendments to the floor, is that the majority party, roughly speaking, has about $500 billion of tax cuts, most of it accelerated beyond the year 2002--my colleague is shaking his head. We can have a debate upon that, and I will be very reassured if that is not the case. 
Mr. President, if we have hundreds of billions of dollars, even if it is not $500 billion, in tax cuts and then the tradeoff is going to be cuts, but where? What is going to be the offset? They do not want to go after the corporate welfare. They do not want to go after the Pentagon budget. They want to have hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts, most of it benefiting high-income, wealthy people. Where will the cuts be? 
In the last Congress almost all cuts focused on low-income families, low-income children, educational programs. All those programs were in jeopardy last time. 
This time I think we need a reassurance and we need a strong vote in favor of each of these amendments so that we can have a reassurance for many, many citizens in our country. The goodness of America says do not cut Head Start. The goodness of America says do not cut the Women, Infants, and Children Program. The goodness of America says do not cut health care programs that will affect the status of children. The goodness of America says do not make disproportionate cuts in any of those programs. They have worked. They are important. They are vital. 
I hope I will get 100 votes for each of these amendments. If not, then my colleagues will be making their point. My colleagues will be saying we refuse to vote for an amendment that puts us on record that we will not reduce Federal outlays in a manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition, and health programs for children. I cannot imagine why any Senator would vote against such an amendment. We should go on record and let the goodness of the Senate speak out on these amendments. 
I look forward to coming to the floor with each of these amendments. I will have much supporting evidence. I want to talk about what happened in the last Congress. I want to go over exactly where we made the cuts, and I want to see if I can get my colleagues to make a commitment that we will not continue down this path. I really do believe that the vast majority of people in America think it would be wrong to make more cuts in programs like WIC and Head Start, more cuts in programs that affect the health care, nutrition and educational status of our children. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will make clear that from now on, if you are convicted of beating your wife, your husband, or your children, your actions will result in you forfeiting your firearm privileges, no matter who you are. 
The bill amends the Federal law that prohibits someone with a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence from possessing firearms or ammunition so that the law is applied prospectively only, from the date of enactment. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. We know that all too often the only difference between a battered woman and a dead woman is a batterer with a gun. Many of you are familiar with facts I have stood here and recited in the past: Four women a day are killed at the hands of their batterer; 
The California Department of Justice Law Enforcement reported in 1994 that 68 percent of the murder victims known to have been killed by an intimate were killed by firearms, 68 percent; 
The likelihood of a woman dying during a domestic assault is directly related to the type of weapon available. When a firearms is available, the assault is three times more likely to end in death than an assault with a knife. If no weapon is available the dispute is 23 times less likely to end in death; 
Fifty-seven percent of children under 12 who are murdered are killed by a parent. 
These are statistics based only on what is reported. We know that there are people watching who are victims of abuse in their own homes. It is happening to women that you know in your work place, in your church or synagogue and your neighborhood. 
Domestic violence is the most underreported crime in the country. 
We will not tolerate the violence. 
We will not ignore the violence. 
We will not say that it is someone else's responsibility. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I always appreciate working with the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Massachusetts. We have been on the floor before talking about low-income energy assistance, and we really have to be on the floor today speaking about this. 
Sometimes we talk about these issues, and we just talk. It may not be connected to people's lives. But what we say today on the floor of the U.S. Senate is connected to people's lives in many of our States. 
It is between 8 and 15 degrees below zero in most of Minnesota today. It might get to zero this daytime. 
Mr. President, we have had a brutal winter in our State and, in addition, as the Senator from Vermont mentioned, natural gas prices are up 60 percent from last year's prices, heating oil is up 40 percent over last year, and the cost of propane is 60 percent higher than last year. 
Our State is colder than it was last year. It costs much more to heat a home. These oil prices have skyrocketed, and this means we have a crisis, all in capital letters. 
Mr. President, the Governor, Governor Arne Carlson, has used $9 million of the State's fund for additional assistance, but we have in fiscal year 1997 additional money, several hundreds of millions of dollars, for emergency energy assistance. It is an emergency. 
In Minnesota, we have about 300,000 citizens who are dependent upon this lifeline program. It is not a large grant. It averages about $350, but for many of these citizens--many of them elderly, many of them children--this is a lifeline program, without which either people go cold or people huddle in one room in their home. I wish that was an exaggeration, but it is not. I have visited with these families. Our people somehow figure out how to pay for their heat, but then they don't have enough money to buy food or they don't have enough money to buy prescription drugs that they need. This is a particular problem with the elderly. 
Mr. President, we are going to run out of assistance. We are going to have a dire situation in Minnesota. This is no melodrama on my part. It is time this emergency money be released. 
Almost every day I am on the phone talking to the White House, talking to Health and Human Services, the Office of Management and Budget, and I don't speak on the floor of the Senate today to point the finger, because I believe that in the next few days--the sooner the better--the White House will release this money. 
Last year, I went to the President--other Senators joined: Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and others--and just made the request face to face. I said, `Mr. President, I don't want people to go cold in my State.' 
This is not an exaggeration. I am sure that this money will be released, but today on the floor of the Senate, my appeal to the White House is: Please, make the decision. Please, make the decision today. Please release the funding. Time is not neutral. Time is not on our side. It doesn't do any good to get the funding in April. We need this assistance for vulnerable citizens in our cold-weather States, and we need it now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to introduce a bill today that will address a serious problem faced by many Persian Gulf veterans--the denial of their claims for VA compensation based solely on the fact that their symptoms arose more than 2 years after they last served in the gulf. This bill is a companion to H.R. 466 introduced recently by Congressman Lane Evans, ranking minority member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and an outstanding, energetic, and dedicated veterans' advocate. 
This bill would extend from 2 to 10 years the time by which a veteran must develop symptoms after departing the gulf to be eligible to file for VA disability compensation. 
While this legislation is simple and straight forward, there are a number of reasons that I am introducing it that require some elaboration. 
Over a month ago Congressman Evans and I sent a joint letter to VA Secretary Jesse Brown asking him to administratively extend the presumptive period from 2 to 10 years. We pointed out that the VA had denied about 95 percent of Persian gulf veterans' claims for undiagnosed illnesses and noted that in House testimony last March Secretary Brown himself said that `most of the people we are denying, a large percentage of the people that we are denying, do not have a disease within the 2-year period.' The Secretary added that there was a need to examine health problems emerging after that time period. 
Mr. President, our letter also noted that continuing disclosures about possible exposures of our troops in the gulf to chemical weapons make it clear that it may take many years before we have a full understanding of what occurred during the Persian Gulf war and how these events affected our veterans. In closing, we stressed that gulf war veterans must be given the benefit of the doubt. 
Although Secretary Brown has not yet replied to our letter, I know that he is a fearless and deeply committed advocate of our Nation's veterans and fully shares my view that America's veterans must always be given the benefit of the doubt. Under his leadership, the VA is now reviewing 11,000 cases to ensure that Persian Gulf veterans are indeed given the benefit of the doubt in the development and adjudication of their compensation claims. 
Secretary Brown, at the request of President Clinton, is formulating a plan to expand the deadline for compensation which is to be submitted to the President in March. I anticipate that the administration will extend the deadline and believe that when this occurs they'll want congressional authorization. This bill 
is intended to grant them that authority. 
Mr. President, so that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will better understand my reasons for introducing this bill and why I believe the administration must and will extend the deadline for filing gulf war claims, permit me to list some of the key factors involved: 
Sick Persian Gulf veterans shouldn't be kept in limbo, waiting years for the completion of research that should have been done years ago on the long-term health effects of low-level exposures to chemical and other agents; 
In this connection, the experience of atomic veterans for over 50 years is hardly encouraging, with disputes among scientists persisting about the long-term effects of exposure to low-level radiation and about the validity of U.S. Government-funded radiation dose reconstructions--dose reconstructions which continue to be a major factor in denial of the vast majority of atomic veterans' claims for VA compensation; 
While I'm pleased that research is finally taking place after a delay of over 5 years stemming from DOD's contention that there were no chemical exposures and that low-level exposures had no health effects, I fear there is a possibility that the etiology of Persian Gulf illnesses may never be known because needed scientific data was not collected immediately after the war and because of the complexity of figuring out the synergistic effects of various combinations of harmful agents present during the gulf war. 
DOD and CIA are developing new information about possible chemical and other exposures during the gulf war that could further complicate the search for the causes of illnesses, while the media sometimes carry contradictory reports on such exposures that add to the uncertainties and anxieties of veterans and their families; 
There are a number of serious diseases that are not manifested until 10 years or more after initial exposure to harmful agents. 
In closing, Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the brave Minnesota veterans of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm whom I met with over a month ago. These Minnesota veterans who are my mentors told me about the illnesses and symptoms they developed after the war, including skin rashes, hair loss, reproductive problems, memory loss, headaches, aching joints, and internal bleeding. They said that they are scared to death about their health problems. I was deeply moved by their accounts and pledged to do all I could to help them. Moreover, I was distressed to learn that as of last month, out of 171 Minnesota gulf veterans who had filed disability claims, only 18 were receiving full or partial disability benefits. 
As part of an action plan to help Minnesota gulf veterans, I told them that Congressman Evans and I were writing to Secretary Brown to extend the 2-year period to 10 years. This initiative was supported both by Minnesota Persian Gulf veterans and State veterans' leaders and the bill I'm now introducing is a logical followup to the letter sent to Secretary Brown. 
I am very pleased to note that this legislation is supported by the American Legion and the Vietnam Veterans of America and I urge my colleagues to join these organizations in strongly supporting this bill. 
I dedicate this bill to the patriotic and courageous Minnesota veterans who served in the Persian Gulf war.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on January 21 I cosponsored S. 212, the Senate leadership's version of President Clinton's education tax deduction and credit plan. As an educator for 20 years and a Senator who believes in education, I couldn't be more enthusiastic that the President and the leadership have chosen to invest $35 billion over the next 5 years into higher education in this country. This is a marvelous goal and I support it without hesitation. 
When it comes to investing a large sum of money into education, with the goal of making education more affordable for more students and working families, I think that it is important to explore every viable option. The tax system is one way to distribute money to working families. Another existing system is the Pell Grant Program, which is already geared toward targeting money at the students who are most likely not to attend college because of a lack of funds. Currently, Pell Grants go almost exclusively to lower income families. But that is not how Pell was designed. It was designed to reach families based on their need, not based on their income. If the Pell Grant Program were to be funded up to its authorized level, it would be of great benefit to many middle-class families as well as lower middle-class families. Because Pell is a proven entity and a great deal could be gained by investing in it, I rise today to introduce a second option on how to bring higher education into the reach of more Americans. 
It is both saddening and shameful that in this country, the best predictor of attending college is the family income. We have engineered a system in this country where the doors to college are closed for those who have the most to gain from higher education. Only 16 percent of college freshmen come from households earning $20,000 a year or less. Only half of them actually graduate by age 24, and those that drop out cite the expense of college as their No. 1 concern. Clearly, we are doing an inadequate job of addressing the financial needs of our Nation's college bound youth. According to David Wessel of the Wall Street Journal, three-quarters of higher income students attend college. Half of middle income students attend college. But just one-quarter of poorest income students attend college. 
As reported by the New York Times, `the impact of [financial pressures on the poor] has been camouflaged by the steady growth in college attendance by more affluent students and by older people. But students from poor families have increasingly been left behind.' The proportion of students earning college degrees by age 24 from families in the richest quarter of the population has jumped from 31 percent in 1979 to 79 percent in 1994. But the rate among students from families in the poorest population over the exact same years, 1979 to 1994, has stayed dead flat at 8 percent. 
Looked at another way, affluent students in 1979 were 4 times more likely to graduate from college at 24 than poor students, but 10 times more likely in 1994. According to Thomas Mortenson, a higher education policy analyst in Iowa City, `there has been a redistribution of educational opportunity. We have a greater inequality of educational attainment by age 24 than at any time during the last 25 years. Lower income kids are having a terrible time in higher education.' 
Mr. President, 25 years ago, the Pell Program was created to respond to these discrepancies. The goal of Pell grants was to target funds toward those families that were 
likely to send their children to college but couldn't afford to. Consequently, Pell grants have no income limit. Even a family with a very high income is eligible for Pell, if it can be shown that they have need--for example, if they have several children and all the kids are in college, they are supposed to fall under the umbrella of the Pell Program. Pell grant awards go first to the neediest students, and are phased out as need decreases. 
It was hoped that the Pell Program would pay off in three very important ways. First, it would enable more motivated but financially insecure students to gain the skills necessary to have productive lives. Second, it would increase the number of students enrolled in institutions of higher learning, and therefore reduce the cost of higher education for everyone. Third, it would provide to the Nation all the wonderful benefits of a well-educated population--a skilled work force, an improved ability to compete with other nations, a more financially secure country. 
The Pell Grant Program has done a world of good. Over the 25 years, 68.2 million awards have been given out to an estimated 30 million students. Millions of lower income students have been able to attend college thanks to Pell. While Pell itself has been unable to actually reduce college tuitions, it is frightening to imagine how expensive colleges would be without the Pell Program, and how few lower income families would be able to obtain diplomas. In terms of overall effect of the Pell Program on our country, it is almost impossible to overstate the significance of having educated so many people who otherwise would have been unlikely to have increased their standard of living and the standards of their families and those around them. 
When Pell was created, it bore a price tag of $47.5 million--in 1971 dollars, $118 million in 1997 dollars--and benefited 176,000 grant recipients. By 1980 it aided 2.7 million students, and today, the Pell Grant Program invests $6.4 billion a year into the education of 3.6 million grant recipients a year. We should not misinterpret the growth of this program as having successfully met the need for the program; however, Pell Grants are something of which the Congress should be extremely proud. 
Let me explain how the Pell Program works, and how it manages to invest money right where it is needed. The formula is simple. First, the `expected family contribution' is determined through a formula used for all Federal student aid programs. The nickname for the expected family contribution is EFC. The EFC takes into account the family income, the number of dependents in the family, the number of family members currently receiving aid or attending college, and certain assets if the family earns more than $50,000 a year. 
Here's an example. A typical two-earner family with an income of $50,000 that has one dependent child in college would be expected to contribute $4,000 per year toward their child's education. The EFC is then subtracted from the maximum Pell Grant award, which under current law is authorized to be $4,500. If you add up the cost of the child's tuition, fees, room, board, and books and it comes out to more than $4,500, then that family could expect to receive $500 in Pell grants. 
This example also succeeds in demonstrating the problem with the Pell grant system. Currently, the Pell maximum award is, indeed, authorized to be $4,500. However, because there was not enough money available for the Pell Program last year, the appropriators lowered the Pell 
maximum award to only $2,700. That means that the average three person family, which I have described above, will not receive a Pell grant award if their income is over $38,600. 
You see, Pell, as originally designed, is supposed to benefit the middle class. But for this to be successful, enough money must be allocated to the program so that the appropriations process can provide the statutory maximum award for each student. 
But this has seldom happened over the years. While the statute sets the maximum award, limited funds available for the program have meant that appropriations language has almost always reduced the maximum award. 
Because the appropriations process reduces the maximum Pell award every year, the purchasing power of Pell grants has dwindled in relation to college costs. During the 80's and 90's, college costs have increased at an annual rate of between 5 percent and 8 percent, increases that have always outpaced inflation. In 1980, the average Pell award of $882 paid 26 percent of the total annual cost of attendance for a 4-year public institution--$3,409--as compared to today, when the average award of $1,579 pays only 16 percent of total costs of $9,649. This, in light of the fact that, as stated in the Higher Education Act, the purpose of the Pell Grant Program is to provide an award that `in combination with reasonable family and student contribution and--other Federal grant aid--will meet at least 75 percent of a student's cost of attendance.' 
In real dollars, appropriations for the Pell Grant Program have increased by almost 50 percent since 1980. However, the appropriated maximum grant has increased only 34 percent, which means that if inflation is factored in, the maximum award has fallen 13 percent. The result is that few families with incomes above $30,000 are likely to qualify for Pell. Last year, 54 percent of Pell recipients had incomes of less than $10,000. 
This is where the bill I introduce today comes in. At a similar cost to the President's tax deduction and credit proposals--$35 billion over 5 years--my bill would increase the maximum Pell grant award to $5,000 from the present level of $2,700, thus bringing the award to the level at which it was created, adjusted for inflation. With the maximum increased, two intents would be accomplished. First, lower income students would be entitled to a larger award, thus having more opportunity to attend college. Second, because the maximum is increased, more students--including students from middle income families--would be eligible for Pell grants. 
Here are a few illustrations. Under current law, a single, independent student with no children is ineligible for even a minimum Pell grant award if she has an income of over $9,800. My bill would effectively double the income eligibility; a single student with no children with an income of over $16,200 would still be eligible for Pell. If that student is a single parent, with two children, her income could be as high as $50,600 and she would still be eligible for Pell, as opposed to current law, which would eliminate her eligibility at an income of $38,800. 
Parents trying to put a dependent child through college would also benefit from this bill. For example, a two-parent family with one child in college under current law is eligible only if their income is lower than $38,600. My bill would raise this eligibility to just under $50,000. Under 
Pell as it exists today, a family with four children in college receives the minimum award for each of their children as long as their income is lower than $72,600. Under this bill, an average family with four children in college would receive the minimum award for each child even if their income was as high as $107,300. 
Now let me take a moment to explain why my proposal and the Clinton proposal are so deserving of the attention and support of this body. 
These days, parents putting children through college, and young adults trying to do it on their own, are facing an increasingly daunting challenge. According to the college board, tuition costs have gone up more than 40 percent since 1985. Expressed in constant 1994 dollars, in 1985 tuition at the average private college was $10,058. By 1994, it was $14,486--a 44 percent increase. The average public college tuition was $2,095 in 1985. By 1994, it was $2,948--a 41 percent increase. 
Last year alone, college tuition went up 6 percent, more than double the rate of inflation. Since 1980, college tuition has risen faster than medical costs, and more than twice as fast as family income. 
For the last 10 years, tuition increases at State universities, community colleges, and technical colleges in Minnesota have ranged from 2 to almost 9 percent every single year. The largest trend in tuition increases began in the early 1980's. Since then, tuition at the University of Minnesota has risen 264 percent while the Consumer Price Index has gone up 71 percent--available chart shows only the increase between 1981 and 1992, that is why its numbers are smaller. Next academic year, a freshman at the UM Liberal Arts College will pay $3,618, plus a higher activity fee, plus a new $135 computing fee. 
All over Minnesota--at private schools, public universities and colleges--tuition is going up faster than personal disposable income per capita. 
Meanwhile, Government and private aid has declined. Federal appropriations for student aid fell 9 percent between 1980 and 1993 while States allocations fell 13 percent between 1986 and 1992. Corporate and private giving is far too small to offset these declines. Last year, the Federal Government spent nearly 40 percent less than it did the year before to help young people in Minnesota pay for college with Perkins loans. That's $1.5 million less in loans--3,214 fewer students getting help with their educations. Overall, public subsidies to higher education have shrunk from 45 percent of higher education's revenues in 1980 to 35 percent today, most of it to public universities. Today, more than 80 percent of America's college students study at public universities. 
The trend in Federal aid to post-secondary students is towards more loans and away from grants. Although more money is now available to college students, a greater proportion of it must be paid back. According to the college board, the Federal Government invested 80 percent of its higher education budget into Grants and only 20 percent in loans. Today, those numbers are almost exactly reversed. This is a trend that affects poorer students much more than those who are wealthier, as poor students are forced to ask themselves--what if I don't graduate, what will I do with my debt? For these students, Pell Grants are a lifeline that keeps being pulled out of their reach. 
Between 1985 and 1994, the share of college costs covered by the maximum Pell grant has steadily fallen for all types of institutions. For example, at a private university, a Pell Grant covered about 17 percent the cost of attendance in 1985. By 1994, that fell to about 10 percent. Similarly, at a public university, a Pell Grant paid for about 50 percent of college costs in 1985. In 1994, that figure was down to about 30 percent. 
As a result, the average debt of those emerging from higher education grows at a rate much greater than inflation. Six-and-a-half million students, nearly half of the Nation's enrollment, have loans totaling $23.8 billion. Student borrowing has grown at an average rate of 22 percent per year since 1990, outpacing personal income growth four times over. 
At Moorehead State University in Moorehead, MN, students are graduating with a staggering amount of debt. The average student graduating this spring who finished her degree in 4 years owes $10,762. For those who take 5 years to graduate, their debt is even higher, an average of $11,450. Those figures are both much higher than only 4 years ago. 
The Minnesota State Colleges and Universities report that students graduating from 2-year colleges incur debt of $8,000 to $10,000. Those attending State universities are coming out of school with $15,000 to $20,000 of debt. 
It should be no surprise that defaults cost the Federal Government over $2 billion a year. 
It's not only students that are increasingly saddled with debt. Parents are borrowing more and more in order to finance their children's educations. The average loan in the PLUS Program--parental loans for undergraduate students--between 1992 and 1993 jumped from $3,260 to $4,525. In addition, the loan volume for the program grew by 26 percent. 
If you are a student planning to attend college, or a parent planning on paying for your child, you'd better start saving now. Even if you plan to send your child to a State school, and even if you start saving 17 years in advance, you are going to have to start putting away a chunk of change. 
Put together, rising costs of education and decreasing Government aid spells a greater burden on students and their families--a burden that is often impossible to initiate, and at times, if attempted, impossible to sustain. 
But it's crazy for us to allow this to go on. Education is the key to the economic security of this Nation. By the year 2000, 50 percent of all new jobs will require a college education. It is not only our duty and obligation to assist these students in their higher education endeavors, it is essential for our country's future. 
Higher education pays off. Every year of higher education increases an individual's income between 6 and 12 percent. In fact, a college-educated male earns 83% more during his lifetime than a noncollege-educated male. 
Education is married to earnings potential. A high school dropout can expect to earn, on 
average, under $13,000 a year; a high school graduate, under $19,000; while a college graduate can earn over $32,000 and a master's degree recipient can earn over $40,000; a doctoral recipient can earn over $54,000; and a professional degree recipient earns, on average, over $74,000. 
A recent survey of managers showed that an investment in the educational level of their work force resulted in twice the return in increased productivity of a comparable increase in work hours and nearly three times the return of an investment in capital stock. 
Data from the Society of Research also reveals that poverty rate declines as education levels increase. According to the 1992 Census, almost a quarter of the children under the age of 6 in the United States live in poverty. For many, the opportunity for a higher education lies only in the availability of Pell grants. Therefore, the Pell Grant Program is integral in breaking the chain of poverty. In fact, a national study conducted in 1995 revealed that AFDC recipients receiving financial aid are 80 percent more likely to graduate college and obtain permanent jobs. 
Families who live in the middle or higher socio-economic bracket will send their children to college regardless of available financial assistance. Such is not the case for low income groups. Cut backs in financial assistance correlate to lack of enrollment and long term attendance among lower socio-economic groups. Without the availability of Pell grants, low income students will not have the opportunity for advanced degrees. 
Mr. President, these are the reasons that I am introducing this bill. Ultimately, education is what separates those who achieve from those who can never realize the American Dream. The Government needs to invest in its citizens if democracy is to flourish, if we are to compete in the global marketplace, and if we are to live up to our responsibility to the American people. 
As we plan for our country's future and that of its youth, let us be sure that a higher education is available and accessible for all. Let's create a system in the 21st century in which the No. 1 predictor of college attendance is not income, but rather desire. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 212 and to support this bill.

Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. 
First of all, let me associate myself with the remarks of the minority leader. I never really had a chance to serve with Senator Tsongas, and I really never had a chance to get to know him, but it is hard not to admire his work. He will be missed by his family and loved ones, and he will also be missed by our country. As a Senator from Minnesota, I certainly want to send my love to Paul Tsongas' family.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for just a brief period of time today, I want to talk about reform because I think the whole issue of the mix of money and politics and what we are going to do to change the system is going to become the key issue of this 105th Congress. 
People have been reading in the newspapers and they have been hearing on the radio or they have been seeing on TV all sorts of comment about the abuses which took place in this past campaign. My argument is that these abuses are embedded in the very ways in which we finance our campaigns. 
What has happened--and I do not think any of us should fool ourselves here, whether we are Republicans or Democrats--is that to most of the people in the country, from Pennsylvania to Minnesota to California, it does not even look like elections; it looks like auctions, and I think all too many people believe that national political leaders are for sale. 
I would like to say today on the floor of the Senate that I do not believe that is the case. I do not want to have anything to do with bashing of people in public service. I believe in public service. That is why I am here. That is why we are here. 
I also want to say today on the floor of the Senate that as a matter of fact we are talking about a certain kind of corruption, not as in the wrongdoing of individual officeholders, but it is systemic, and it is more serious. It has to do with the ways in which money determines what issues are on the table. It has to do with the ways in which money determines who has the disproportionate amount of access to decisionmaking. It has to do with the relationship between money and political clout. It has to do with the political system where too few people probably have too much wealth, power and say and the vast majority of the people feel locked out, not well represented. 
I would argue that the way big money has come to dominate politics has become the ethical issue of our time. I say to all of my colleagues--I make this appeal, and I want to follow up on this appeal with every bit of leverage I have as a Senator--that all of us in office should hate this system. On the one hand, it is a bit like the play `Fiddler on the Roof'--you can argue that, well, no, people should not hate the system because in a way the current system is wired for incumbents. They can raise more money. But I really think all of us should hate this system, because even if you believe in your heart of hearts, even if you are absolutely convinced that the compelling need to raise money never has affected any position you have taken on any issue, even if you believe that, and hopefully it is the case, it sure does not look that way to people. If we want people to believe in this political process, and we want people to believe in our work, and we want people to believe in the Congress, and we want people to believe in us, then we better get this big money out of politics and we better turn this system not upside down--it is upside down right now--we better turn this system right side up. 
It is just crystal clear. The spending continues to skyrocket, and in 1996 spending was up and participation down--more disillusionment, more indignation, more people in the country losing faith in the elections and losing faith in this political process. 
There are any number of different approaches that can be 
taken, and I want to talk about three. I have for the better part of last year, year and a half, worked with Senators Feingold and McCain, Senator Kassebaum was involved in this--she will be sorely missed--Senator Thompson, Senator Graham, and this effort, this piece of legislation, which still keeps too many big private dollars in politics, sure represents a very important and positive step forward: getting rid of all the soft money, all of the huge amounts of money that people can contribute in the name of party building, getting the costs of campaigns down, voluntary spending limits, some resources for candidates to help challengers. It goes in the right direction, and I will work hard with Senator McCain and Senator Feingold. 
There is a separate issue of soft money and all the ways in which people can contribute huge amounts of money, way beyond any spending limit, again, all in the name of party building. With more time, I will go into all of this in specifics. We ought to abolish that. And that would be a focus of mine. I will have a bill on soft money. 
In the best of all worlds, if you want to talk about desirability, I will tell you something. People in the country are in a downright anti-status-quo mood, and I really think we ought to model ourselves after what Maine has done. Maine led the Nation. Maine passed the clean money option. And I will be introducing a bill, I hope with other Senators, as well, that essentially says, look, we are going to get all of the interested money out, and what we are going to essentially say to people in the country is, look, for around $5 per person, how about a system where the people own the elections? It is your election. And because it is your capital, it becomes your Government and we move all of this interested, big, private money out. We really do have a level playing field between challengers and incumbents, and we really do have clean money politics. 
I think that is the best system of all, and I look forward to introducing that bill with other Senators and pushing that forward as well. 
A final point. 
It may be that none of these approaches in their entirety will pass the Senate. And other people will have other ideas. 
But first, to people in the country who might be watching, and I will figure out other ways of having a wider forum: You have to turn up the heat, people. The citizens in this country have to turn up the heat. On February 22, in Minnesota, we are going to have a town meeting, hopefully with the whole congressional delegation. Lots of people are going to be there from Minnesota. They are going to come, and they are going to say: Senators and Representatives, we may not know all the specifics of each bill, but we want reform. We want you to change this system. We are tired of all the big money and we are tired of all the vicious attacks. 
People need to turn up the heat. I think we need something like Earth Day. I think we need Reform Day. I think we need to have congressional delegations from every State meeting with people back in the States on the same day within the next couple of months, because this Congress has to take action. And anybody listening, citizens who are listening, it has to happen in the first 100 days, because if it does not happen at the beginning of this Congress, the atmosphere is going to become poisonous. There will be finger pointing and accusations on both sides. Everybody is going to try to figure out their own angle, and it will not get done. But this is the time for the reform. Let us move towards real grassroots citizen action. 
Second, President Clinton, it is important for you to be outspoken. Presidential leadership, Presidential power--you need to push for the reform. Both parties have made plenty of mistakes. There have been plenty of transgressions. There is plenty of wrong, and the accusations can go back and forth in perpetuity. Why do we not, once and for all, change the system? 
Finally, for myself, at the beginning of this Congress--for a short period of time I had an interesting discussion with both leaders in which I maintained I did not know whether we should even go into recess. I thought between January 7 and January 20 we ought to focus just on reform. Now we have another recess period coming up in mid-February. I think we need to give very serious thought to focusing on reform at the very beginning. I am going to try to use whatever leverage I have as a Senator to push in that direction. 
In the Labor and Human Resources Committee the other day I suggested another possibility. Again, these are just proposals as we try to figure out how we can move this process forward. I suggested that maybe, until we have the reform, what we need to do in every committee is to have people come in and testify, file written testimony as to whether or not they have given contributions or the organizations they represent have given contributions to the members of the committee in the year prior to testimony and the year after testimony. I do not know whether that is something to push forward and have a vote on or not. 
But I think, again, all of these approaches are not efforts to point the finger at a Senator or Representative. That is bashing. I want nothing to do with it. Or, for that matter, at anybody who is testifying. But I want to bring into sharp focus what is wrong with this process, the perceptions people have about it around the country, all the ways in which it has undercut democracy. You cannot have all of these huge amounts of money pouring into politics and elections and at the same time have real democracy where each person counts as one and no more than one. This is the compelling issue for this Congress. 
Mr. President, we have to take action. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, children's health care coverage needs to be a priority in this Congress. We need to be committed to providing access to affordable coverage and care to all working families in America. We also need to provide coverage for uninsured pregnant women, in order to ensure that children get a healthy start in life. All children should have access to services that provide for their basic health care needs such as immunization, preventive services, acute care, and dental care services, regardless of whether they live in rural or urban areas. 
Employers are rapidly cutting health care coverage for children of their employees. When a family earning $16,000 each year is required to pay over 10 percent and sometimes as much as one-third of their income to purchase health insurance for their children, they are forced to make very difficult choices. They must choose between providing their children with basic needs such as food and shelter, and paying for health insurance. 
Health care coverage for children is an investment in the future. Children with undiagnosed or untreated health problems may have difficulty learning in school. A child with poor vision that has not been diagnosed or treated may be unable to see the blackboard. A child who is in pain from preventable tooth decay may not be able to eat an adequate diet, and the pain may make it difficult for the child to concentrate. A child with asthma who has poor access to care may spend many hours in an emergency department and many days in the hospital for treatment of problems that could have been prevented. This occurs at a significant cost not only in terms of dollars, but also in terms of lost opportunities to attend school, and loss of work time and income for the child's parents. These situations can be prevented with adequate health care coverage and access for children. 
Children in rural areas are especially vulnerable, as there are fewer services available in these areas, and some needed services are located at significant distances from their homes. In addition, these children often live in homes where their parents work for small employers, who are unable to offer dependent coverage at a low cost. 
Several States have demonstrated the cost savings available by providing assistance to working families. My home State, Minnesota, operates its own program that helps families buy private health insurance. Ninety-thousand people are covered, including 50,000 children. Over the years, more than 41,000 families have used MinnesotaCare to leave or stay off welfare, saving the taxpayers $26 million per year. 
It is essential that we address this issue and provide low- and middle-income families with the option to purchase affordable private insurance coverage for their children. These families must be provided with the means to purchase this coverage in a timely manner, so that they do not have to delay the purchase of coverage for their children. 
We need to build on successful private, State, and Federal efforts to help working families afford to provide health coverage for their children. Providing coverage for children through age 18 and pregnant women is the next logical step in incremental health care reform. It is sound policy and makes economic sense. It will ensure that all children in America have a healthy start in life.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President. I am extremely pleased to be an original cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold-Thompson-Wellstone campaign finance reform bill. I hope the Senate will bring it to the floor very early in this Congress--preferably during the first three months of this year. Campaign finance reform is clearly one of the most crucial issues we face, and the public is more than ready for fundamental reform. 
I have been working hard with my colleagues on this bipartisan bill, which we hope becomes the vehicle for genuine reform this year. I hope that public dissatisfaction with campaign politics-as-usual, especially as exemplified by the abuses of the campaign season just past, will push this Congress to act decisively. We should choose the best aspects of the various bills that will be introduced this year and fix the problems which have made themselves so apparent. We know there will opposition to any significant changes in the way we organize and finance campaigns for federal office, but if there is sufficient pressure from around the country, we can pass real reform. 
So let us bring this bill to the floor and amend it. No reform bill is perfect. Let Republicans and Democrats offer their changes. As the only viable, bipartisan campaign finance reform bill, this proposal represents our best hope for taking a significant step toward genuine reform. 
In some ways this bill does not go as far as I believe will be necessary in order to repair our damaged campaign finance system. But it would ban `soft money' contributions to parties. It would impose voluntary spending limits and require greater disclosure of independent expenditures. It would restrict PAC contributions and `bundling,' and it would place more restrictions on foreign contributions. It is a good bill. Its enactment would be an excellent start toward restoring integrity to our political process. 
We must enact comprehensive reform. But I am especially committed this year to addressing the striking abuses in the areas of `soft money' and issue-advocacy ads. A system which invites circumvention mocks itself. 
Mr. President, I intend to speak at greater length in the coming days on the subject of campaign finance reform. Today, I enthusiastically endorse this bipartisan effort to move real reform and to begin to restore Americans' belief in our democratic institutions.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have had some discussion with the majority and minority leaders on this question. I feel very strongly, and I think that an overwhelming majority of people in the country feel, that there is no more important thing we can do than to pass a reform bill and get a lot of this big money out of politics. 
In this last election cycle, we saw the worst of the worst on top of a system that has not worked well for the people in the country. I feel like we should not--go into recess and we ought to get started on this. I wonder if the majority leader can make a commitment that within the first 100 days, we will at least have such a bill on the floor of the Senate.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate the discussions that I have had with the majority leader and minority leader. I was trying to get back to them as they were going through the resolutions. 
I guess when I hear the majority leader and minority leader speak about this and other business that we have to transact, while I absolutely am convinced about their commitment, it just brings into even sharper focus for me the need for this body to make a commitment: that we will by the end of 100 days have a bill on the floor of the Senate. We have been talking about this for a long, long time. I don't have the experience some Senators do. I am just starting my second term. But every single time this has come up, speeches have been made, and then we end up not passing a reform bill. I think nothing could be more important than for us to make a commitment. 
What about within the first 4 months as opposed to the first 3 months? Can the majority leader make a commitment that he will do everything possible to try to have a bill on the floor of the Senate within a 4-month period? That is reasonable, and that is all I am asking for. 
I think the majority leader is committed to this. I want to say to my friend, and he is a friend, that of course I am not judging what the specific content will be. I am not requesting any commitment to a particular content, but I am requesting a commitment that we go on record and--you know, if we had to have a vote on this, then I think it would be a vote as to whether or not Senators, Democrats and Republicans, are serious about taking action within a 4-month period, which is very reasonable. I do not know how many votes there would be, but I think that is what it is about. I want to be counted as someone who is willing to make a commitment to this. 
Would the majority leader be willing to make a commitment that certainly with his considerable skill and ability he will, along with the minority leader with his skill and ability, that the two of them together as leadership, will make a commitment that within the first 4 months they will do everything possible to take action and have the debate that the people in the country are ready for and pass--and pass--the piece of legislation? We do not have to say `pass,' but at least bring a bill to the floor.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not drag this on. I have some mixed feelings. I think I will have to object because, again, I have tremendous respect for both leaders, but when I hear language about `best effort,' `within as reasonable a time period as possible,' it just represents really not any kind of specific commitment at all. 
I will just say that those who have worked on the reform--and the Senator mentioned many; the Senator mentioned Republicans as well as Democrats--every one of them has said, if we let this drag on, we are going to have more and more acrimony, given all sorts of hearings and whatnot coming up, and we are going to make a huge mistake. We need to make this a priority of this 105th Congress, and we need to focus on this, and we need to get the job done. I think a 4-month period is more than reasonable just to have a commitment from the leadership to make every effort possible. I am willing to go with that language to have such a piece of legislation on the floor of the Senate, understanding that this is the core issue. 
I think really this is an issue that people are talking about more than any other issue in the country right now. I do not think it is unreasonable. I thought 100 days, and I thought 4 months. I do not think it would be unreasonable at all for me to make this request. I do not know why the leadership would not be able to say we will make every effort possible to have this bill on the floor within the next 4 months. And if not, then I think I will object.

Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, finally, and so we can move forward, just one more time for the context, this is the core issue. That is why I come to the floor. I know other Senators feel the same. I do not lay any claim to more righteousness about it. This is a core issue. 
People in the country have just absolutely lost their confidence in this political process. I do not think they are real optimistic about our taking any action. In all due respect to the leadership, I have heard too many of my own colleagues talk about reform and then dismiss it, saying it is not going to really happen. I already hear the discussions of how people can raise money for the next cycle. 
The only request I made of leadership today--and the wording really is, I think, very modest. It was just a commitment from the leadership. I started out 100 days, at least within the next 4 months, that the leadership would make a commitment to do everything possible to get a reform bill on the floor of the Senate. That is all I asked for. 
Now, Mr. President, the majority leader said, well, the only alternative is to go into recess. That is not the only alternative. That is not my alternative. We have a vote. We can have a vote on adjournment. I know what the vote will be. I am sure there will be an overwhelming vote for adjournment. But if there are only two people, one, or three that say, `No, we are ready to take on this reform and get to work,' I am proud to be counted as the one or two or three. This is not the only alternative.

I find it puzzling that the only thing I asked for today--because I do have a real fear this is just going to get put off and we are not going to take action--the only thing I asked for, and maybe my colleague did not hear this, was a commitment from the leadership to do everything possible, I used that word, and I started with 100 days, within 4 months, and get a bill on the floor. That is all I ask for. 
I think it would be very important to get that kind of a leadership commitment.

We should not be taking a recess in February if we are not going to take up this piece of legislation of reform as soon as possible, that we are dragging it out, and I can see what is going to happen. 
So today I will not object, but I will come out with a similar initiative, I say to my colleague from Arizona, and maybe we should be working today and saying we should not be in recess in February.
