Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the bill managers for their hard work to reach an agreement on the bill before us today. I especially want to thank them for including the District of Columbia Adoption Improvement Act of 1998 in the omnibus appropriations bill. 
As chairman of the Senate Oversight Subcommittee on Government Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, improving adoption for foster care in the District is one of my highest priorities. For the past year, I, along with Senators DeWine, Grassley, Craig, and Landrieu, have been looking for ways to make it easier for children in the Nation's Capital to find an adoptive family. 
Earlier this year, we hosted an Adoption Fair on Capitol Hill in which resulted in the adoption of five children to two families. We also held a hearing in the subcommittee to explore a solution that would shorten the time it takes for children in the District to be adopted. 
Gordon Gosselink, age 13, testified before the subcommittee at this hearing about how he entered the District's foster care system at the age of two. For the next 10 years, he lived in several foster care homes and even endured physical abuse until he was finally adopted at the age of 13 by Robert and Mary Beth Gosselink. He said: 
Last year, I met Rob and Mary Beth Gosselink at a Christmas party. When my social worker told me that two people were hoping to adopt me, I was really excited. I knew that this was the one. I moved [in] with Rob and Mary Beth last year at Easter time, and now I am part of the Gosselink Family. Things are really great now. I like my neighborhood and I am doing well in school. Best of all, I am with a family who loves me forever. My parents now are adopting another boy named Ricardo who is 11 years old. I am looking forward to having a new brother. I know there are a lot of kids who are still waiting for a home. I hope they find homes, too, like me. 
Some children are not as lucky as Gordon. Currently, there are 994 children in the District with the goal of adoption but only 50 percent have been referred to the District's adoption branch. Even worse, many children in the District grow up moving from foster care home to foster care home without finding an adoptive family by the age of 18. The most recent statistics indicate that 67 percent of the children who left the foster care system, left because they turned 18 years old. In other words, one of the only ways out of the system, is to grow-up to adulthood within the system. Once these children turn 18, they are released to the streets without a family or a home. 
Allowing just one child to grow up without the love, attention, and commitment of a family is a tragedy. Allowing hundreds to languish in foster care is a disgrace. 
The District Child and Family Services Agency has been under the leadership of Ernestine Jones, the Federal court appointed receiver for nearly one year now. I am hopeful that reforming the system will remain a priority and these discouraging realities will no longer haunt the children who need the system most. 
We must also recognize foster care and adoptive parents for their contribution and their example of taking in these children when they need them most. As many of the Senators, who have adopted children, know, we need to make it easier, not more difficult, for parents to adopt. 
I believe this can be done and systemic improvements can be made with positive results--as seen in my home state of Kansas. The Kansas reform model of the Child and Welfare Services Agency has shown some immediate signs of success. Within one year of implementing these reforms, Kansas increased the number of children placed in adoptive homes from 25 percent to 50 percent. Prior to these reforms, the average stay for a child in the Kansas foster care system was two years. Now, the average stay in 13 months. 
Using the Kansas model, we drafted the D.C. adoption reform language and came to a bipartisan agreement which included the Federal court appointed receiver and the Federal court appointed monitor. I am pleased that this compromise language is included in the omnibus appropriations bill. First, the bill would require the D.C. Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) to maintain an accurate database tracking all children found by the Family Division of the District of Columbia Superior Court to be abused or neglected and who is in the custody of the District of Columbia--including any child with the goal of adoption or who is legally free for adoption. Unfortunately, this basic step has been neglected in the past in CFSA. To meet the immediate demand of placing children in adoptive homes, the bill would also require CFSA to contract out some of its adoption functions which may include recruitment, homestudy, and placement services. Like the Kansas model, these contracts would be required to be performance-based contracts. Contractors would be compensated once specific goals, such as an adoption placement or finalization, are achieved. Finally, CFSA and contractors would be required to work together to identify and lift any barriers to timely adoptions. 
I want to stress that in the end, we are talking about individual children who are in search of a permanent and secure home. Any improvement in the system translates into bringing each child closer to the fundamental need of having a loving, adoptive family.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the tremendous work accomplished by Barbara Woolanin, the Curator of the Capitol, in preparing the excellent book on the art in the Capitol created by Constantino Brumidi. The Curator did a magnificent job writing and editing the many articles and photographs which depict the works of the Italian artist, Constantino Brumidi, who was the principal artist of the Capitol. The book was compiled under the direction of the Architect of the Capitol, and Mrs. Woolanin had the assistance of many of her colleagues and fellow employees in the Curator's office. So I would like to commend them all on the excellent quality of this book which will enable many to read about the numerous and exquisite works of painting, sculpture and architecture which Constantino Brumidi created to cover the walls and ceilings of the Capitol. 
I would also like to recommend this excellent artistic book to all of my colleagues and to the many others who will visit the Capitol. The book is available at the House and Senate Gift shops, as well as the Capitol gift shop. 
Constantino Brumidi: Artist of the Capitol 
The new congressional publication, Constantino Brumidi: Artist of the Capitol, was authorized by the 103rd Congress (S. Con. Res. 40) as part of the celebration of the bicentennial of the construction of the Capitol. The book, prepared under the direction of Architect George M. White and completed under Architect Alan M. Hantman, has taken a number of years to research, write, illustrate, edit, and design. The book is richly illustrated, primarily with photographs taken by the Architect of the Capitol Photography Branch. It is intended to be valuable to those visiting and working in the Capitol as well as to specialists, and it should enhance the appreciation and understanding of the building's mural decoration for years to come. 
Brumidi painted murals in the Capitol between 1855 and 1880, contributing greatly to the beauty and unique symbolic character of the Rotunda and of many rooms and corridors. Brumidi had great skill in making the figures he painted on a flat surface look three dimensional; he created rooms where the decoration goes from floor to ceiling. He was also a master in using rich and vibrant color. His murals pay tribute to American history, technological achievements, and values. 
Brumidi's Capitol murals, including the canopy and the frieze, the House and Senate Appropriations Committee Rooms, the President's Room, the Senate Reception Room, and the Brumidi Corridors, are the major focus. The book also gives an overview of his career, including his training and work in Rome. It was primarily envisioned and written by Dr. Barbara Wolanin, Curator for the Architect of the Capitol, who has overseen the conservation of Brumidi's murals. The book would not have been possible without the assistance of many on her staff, especially photographer Wayne Firth. The book includes chapters by a number of other experts, including the Architectural Historian for the Architect, William Allen, historian Pellegrino Nazzaro, art historian Francis V. O'Connor, and conservators Bernard Rabin, Constance Silver, Christiana Cunningham-Adams and George W. Adams, to provide additional perspectives. The book includes information about other painters working with Brumidi, a chronology of Brumidi's life and work, and a list of known works by him. The Government Printing Office is to be commended for the special care it took in the design and printing.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I wish to call attention to a target of terrorism that is rarely discussed. Increasingly, acts of violence are directed at some of the noblest members of our community, namely, humanitarian relief workers. I have been requested by internationally-respected aid agencies to call attention to this issue to encourage risk assessment solutions to minimize humanitarian aid worker fatalities. Borrowing from a recent GAO report entitled Combatting Terrorism, finding solutions demands a `threat and risk assessment approach used by several public and private sector organizations [who] deal with terrorist and other security risks.' Unfortunately, little security expertise has been directed to their extraordinary circumstances. 
How great is this threat? A March study presented at Harvard warned of sharp increases in security threats against the humanitarian community. The United Nations reports that the safety risks for relief workers has altered dramatically in the last 5 years. We know that at least 25 relief workers from America and other countries died in 1997. Between 1995 and 1997, the International Red Cross, alone, recorded 397 separate security incidents of aggression and banditry against its personnel. 
In the farthest corners of the earth, aid workers feed the hungry, heal the sick, comfort the persecuted, and shelter the homeless. Non-profit aid organizations do the hardest work for the littlest pay under the greatest risks with the least support. From Kosovo to Cambodia, Angola to Afghanistan, Liberia to Chechnya, selfless people from America and beyond are serving in increasingly dangerous situations with tremendous personal exposure. 
Some of these voluntary organizations have become household names like CARE, World Vision, the American Red Cross, and Catholic Relief Services. Some are smaller community-based charities. Some are missionary organizations in the most isolated places. Some are faith-based, others are secular, but all of them have one thing in common: they are at greater risk than ever before of murder, abduction, and assault. 
Their extraordinary vulnerability is illustrated by the following stories: In Tajikistan, a health care worker for street children was kidnaped. Ultimately, both the worker and her 5 abductors were killed by a grenade they set off. In Rwanda, a worker transporting emergency food relief died during an attack by unknown assailants at a military checkpoint. The truck was then set on fire, resulting in the loss of 15 tons of humanitarian relief food which would have fed some 1,700 people for the next month. These are only a few of the countless untold stories of worker maiming and death. 
At a recent training course in security for humanitarian organizations held by InterAction (a coalition of international aid organizations), an instructor asked if anyone present had ever evacuated a country under hazardous conditions or had been physically assaulted in the course of their work. Nearly all of the assembled field workers raised their hands. Many asked, `Which time?' 
These voluntary organizations play a central role in foreign assistance, and significant American foreign assistance is being funneled through them at an increasing rate. As these groups distribute US foreign relief, they represent America in difficult and dangerous international arenas. And they do it well--they are lean, efficient, and flexible as is demanded by the extremities of working in the most conflicted regions worldwide. Their accomplishments are legendary. Over the years, they have stood between life and death for countless millions during numerous, threatened famines which were averted because of their efforts. 
This is the central point of my concern. These courageous and selfless groups are more exposed than ever as terrorism continues to escalate against Americans worldwide. The least we can do during the current, on-going public debate on `terrorism' is to direct attention their way to generate risk assessment solutions. They cannot isolate themselves behind compound walls as would an embassy or arm themselves with military equipment. Their job description requires them to live among the people, and by necessity, become vulnerable. 
What can be done? First, I do not want to implement more cumbersome legislation. I do, however, hope to energize private sector solutions relating to risk assessment in this new era of violence. I hope that both public and private sector expertise will be directed towards their unique security challenges. 
One immediate solution is information sharing. Even though most experienced humanitarian workers can relate harrowing stories, hard data is difficult to obtain. Experts agree that security incidents among voluntary organizations operating overseas are vastly under-reported. By working cooperatively, aid organizations can share information and resources as incidents occur. Another solution involves training; InterAction, in conjunction with the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, recently developed a security training course for aid organizations which was well received. I encourage their continued endeavors and commend all groups seeking ways to improve security training. Training resources could be developed and shared via a consortium. 
The gathering of more information quantifying the problems is another step towards solutions. The skills and equipment that once well-served field workers in the past may no longer be adequate. To get a better understanding of the scope and nature of these new problems, I am working with the General Accounting Office to provide a detailed study to assess this problem. 
Aid workers are one of America's great natural resources--living in obscurity at great personal sacrifice to ease the suffering of strangers, they express the best of the American character through their extraordinary generosity. They already sacrifice their personal lives, they should not also pay with their blood. We should not lose them to senseless acts of violence if this can be avoided by appropriate risk assessment and resource sharing. I believe there are unique solutions for these unique challenges, where the best security experts will creatively address these special needs. We should not let these heroes be defeated by heartless terrorism--we should not unnecessarily lose our best to this insidious form of violence.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to recognize an outstanding young fifth grade student from Kansas, Molly Allen. Molly is a student at Sunset Ridge Elementary School in Shawnee Mission, and was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes in July. Since that time, Molly brought awareness about this disease to her fellow classmates by sharing her personal experience. 
In addition, Molly organized her school's effort to raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's walk, which was Saturday, September 19, 1998. This courageous young lady exemplifies leadership and courage. I am proud to recognize one of Kansas' outstanding young leaders. I wish Molly continued success in her future endeavors, and I ask that the Kansas City Star article featuring Molly follow my remarks in the Congressional Record.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Thompson in introducing the Government for the 21st Century Act of 1998. Both majority and minority members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have been working on this legislation throughout this Congress and have come to agreement to introduce this important bill. 
The Government for the 21st Century Act would establish a commission to propose to Congress and the President a plan to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of the Federal government by bringing its structure and operations in line with the needs of America in the next century. The commission would consist of nine members appointed by the President and the congressional leadership of both parties. 
The President may submit his recommendations to the Commission by July 1, 1999. By December 1, 1999, the Commission shall submit to the President and Congress preliminary recommendations on restructuring the Federal government. After a public comment period, the Commission will prepare a final report to the President. Legislation based on the final report would be introduced in both Houses and referred to the appropriate committee of jurisdiction. The bill would be considered by both Houses after 30 days. Once the legislation is signed into law, the Office of Management and Budget would be responsible for implementation. 
The Commission would reinforce our work to maintain a balanced budget. Good government must have agencies that operate efficiently and effectively within their core mission and within their budget. We have achieved one goal of operating within a balanced budget but we must continue to work towards the other. Even under a balanced budget and a budget surplus, inefficiencies and rising costs remain in the Federal government. A balanced budget and a budget surplus does not preclude the Federal government from being accountable to the American people. The Government for the 21st Century Act would see to it that the Federal government will continue to be accountable.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Senate-House Conference Report on the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act. I applaud the hard work of both the Senate and House conferencees, especially the leadership that Senator Grassley has shown on reforming our bankruptcy laws. 
I believe that this conference report is a balance between preventing the fraud and abuse of our bankruptcy system and protecting those who are in considerable economic pain. The increase in bankruptcies has put a strain on our economy and families. These losses associated with bankruptcies have been passed onto consumers, costing every household that pays its bills $400 in hidden taxes. That is not fair to the millions of families who pay their bills every month. This report will prohibit fraud, abuse, and the casual use of our bankruptcy laws while ensuring the payment of child support and alimony. 
I am disheartened by some of my Democratic colleagues and the Administration's opposition to this conference report. This bill not only reforms our current bankruptcy laws, but places Chapter 12 into our bankruptcy code permanently in order to protect family farms and farmers. 
Farmers in Kansas and across the country are experiencing cash flow problems associated with low commodity prices. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture estimated that net farm income would be down by 15.8 percent this year. Some economists have indicated that America's farmers could soon see a recession similar to the one which occurred in the mid-1980's. 
Chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code was created by Congress in 1986 in response to the farm crisis of the mid-1980's, which caused many family farmers to lose their farms and homes. This chapter was specifically designed to protect family farmers by enabling them to reorganize their debts and keep their land. However, this chapter has not yet been reauthorized and expired on October 1. 
While I realize both sides of the aisle have differences on how to provide relief to our family farmers during this difficult time, we are all unanimous in protecting their farms and homes. Just last year, the Senate passed the Family Farmer Protection Act by unanimous consent that would permanently place Chapter 12 in our bankruptcy code. If we want to protect our family farms and farmers during this crisis, we must pass the bankruptcy conference report and place Chapter 12 permanently into our bankruptcy code.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, tomorrow, our Founding Fathers are going to be proud of us. Tomorrow as we pass, hopefully, this International Religious Freedom Act, they will be proud of the tradition that we have carried on, a tradition that finds its wording above our mantels here in this hall and says `In God We Trust,' 
a tradition that finds itself rooted in freedom, particularly religious freedom and religious expression of freedom. They will be proud that we passed this act and that we stand--and stand strong--around the world for religious freedom, freedom from persecution, and allow people of conscience to express their conscience and their desires as they see them fit before God. 
Today, I stand to support the International Religious Freedom Act which addresses religious persecution worldwide. It is a noble and significant effort to confront an ancient prejudice which permeates societies and produces deep suffering. 
I fervently hope that this legislation will be passed for many reasons. This legislation is an expression of solidarity with embattled minority faith communities worldwide. It supports those who simply and humbly seek to practice their religion in peace without crushing governmental interference. It supports those who were commanded to stop worshiping their God and refused. It supports those who fear for safety and even life, yet continue against the odds. 
This is a legislative memorial to anyone who has been unjustly imprisoned for their faith, especially for the ones who refused to recant on principle and remained incarcerated for years, even decades. This is a memorial to peaceful believers who presently sit in jails throughout the world for the crime of daring to express their love of God. 
We put it above our doors in the U.S. Senate. We have written `In God We Trust.' Other people around the world sit in jail for uttering that same phrase. 
This is a memorial to all persecuted believers who strain towards justice and freedom, and have no advocates. 
I admire this bill particularly because it addresses the problem of state-sponsored persecution of peaceful religious groups. This is the most insidious form of persecution. How do sincere people of faith stand against the crushing onslaught of a hostile government? How does an individual, or a small faith community, stand against a national security force? Imagine countries where entire divisions of the national police are dedicated to stalking peaceful people of faith. Now imagine being the victim of this onslaught without any defense or advocates, whatsoever. This is true in communist nations, in developing nations, in ultra-nationalist nations. Bottom line--any individual who dares to stand alone, to stand against a hostile national government for their peaceful faith convictions deserves our advocacy. And this legislation provides tools for that advocacy. 
In his 14th-century epic poem, `The Divine Comedy,' Dante believes a place reserved in the Inferno for those who refused to take a stand on the great moral issues of the day. I believe that religious freedom is one of those great moral issues. It is abundantly clear that in some parts of the world, your religious identity is your death-warrant. This is simply wrong and should not be. Knowing the generosity of the American spirit, I believe that we all agree that religious liberty is worth our defense, that our nation was founded on this principle, and that it is central to the core of our American character. This legislation powerfully expresses our national concern for the sanctity of this fundamental right, internationally. 
Is religious persecution advocacy our responsibility? It is certainly no less justified than our support for democracy dissidents in China or for Sakharov and Soltzenitsyn during the earlier days of Soviet Russia. There are striking parallels between both movements. Both, upon principle, refuse to bow their knee to the crushing dictates of hostile national governments. I am compelled by the stark image of a lone person refusing to recant a precious belief, and consequently incarcerated for the practice of fundamental rights, including free speech, assembly and association. 
This occurs routinely in communist countries and other fundamentalist regimes. There are countless Chinese Christians who have been incarcerated for 20 years and more for their faith. Jail is known as `Chinese seminary' because the government incarcerates so many people for the crime of illegally sharing their faith. In North Vietnam, it's even worse where, routinely, people of faith are incarcerated for 10 or 15 years. But the government does not stop there. Extended family members are also imprisoned, from grandparents and parents, to siblings and children--three generations because of one religious believer. 
If we freedom-loving people do not stand for this fundamental principle who will? It is my honor to continue to advance the elementary notion that this is an inalienable right, which no one can dictate, not even a government. It is a higher principle, protected, divine, precious, fundamental, universal and vastly personal. And it deserves our protest on shear principle, so I am grateful for the advocacy tools provided by this legislation. 
Throughout the centuries, many have fought for religious liberty at great personal cost. There is a magnificent cloud of witnesses who look down upon us, their scars bearing testimony to their commitment even to death for religious freedom. 
Countless, nameless believers have engaged in tremendous feats of faith and self-sacrifice in the name of religious freedom and conviction. The 6 million Jews of Nazi Europe bear witness in an unmatched way for the sacrifice they made as a people for their religious identity. There are over 200 million Christian believers worldwide who presently live in nations which are so hostile to their faith that they are in physical jeopardy. The Bahai of Iran, one of the most devotedly peaceful faith communities in the world was racked in Iran with yet another execution last month and 15 more Bahai are sitting on death row presently. The Tibetan Buddhists had thousands of monasteries destroyed, their nuns raped, their Dalai Lama forced into exile, their religion outlawed. The list is long, the suffering is great, and the goodness of their cause resonates throughout these great halls of freedom today. 
Religious freedom is a fundamental, universal right protected by treaties and constitutions worldwide. I will continue to stand for this principle as long as people suffer for it, along with the many other Members of Congress who share this conviction. In the face of crushing persecution, in apparent defeat, there is a light that continues to pierce the darkness and it will not be extinguished. If we stand for anything, let us stand with those whose courage is a living testimony to the fundamental freedoms we love so deeply in America. Let us vote `yes' on this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to do so. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, during the past several weeks the Senate has spent its time debating spending legislation. Now with only 10 days remaining in the second session of this 105th Congress we are going to begin considering a supplemental spending bill. 
The American people are currently facing tax rates that are near all-time highs. These excessive taxes are being imposed on the American people in spite of the fact that for the first time in a generation the Federal books are balanced. The first time since 1969, since Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon, the books are balanced and we have these near all-time high tax rates. 
Congress did some work in balancing the budget and restraining spending, but Americans did most of the work. And now that there is a surplus, they should be the first ones to get some relief. Currently, on average, 21 million American married couples are forced to shoulder an additional, on average, $1,400 in taxes simply because they are married. That is ridiculous. Congress now has the opportunity to correct this injustice by repealing the marriage penalty. And I want to say this very clearly: We can do so without touching the Social Security trust fund. 
We need to enact profamily, progrowth tax relief and eliminate the marriage penalty. That is an important first step that we need to move forward on reducing our horrendously high taxes in America. America clearly needs strong families. The family is the building block for our country and our hope for the future, and it is unconscionable the Tax Code of the United States is being used to subsidize something against the family, to penalize those who are married rather than living together, and creating disincentives towards marriage. We need to eliminate the marriage penalty during the remaining 11 days of this session of Congress. We have the time. We have the opportunity. The House has passed an $80 billion tax package that includes elimination of a portion of the marriage penalty. The Senate needs to move forward with this now. 
The American people should be the first to benefit from our budget surplus with a reduction in their taxes this year. And we can do it without touching the Social Security trust fund. Elimination of the marriage penalty will serve this purpose. First, it will restrain the growth in the Federal Government, and more importantly will begin to keep Washington taxmongers out of people's wallets and out of their lives. 
During debate on the Treasury-Postal appropriation bill, the Senate spoke overwhelmingly in favor of a complete elimination of the marriage penalty. We need as large a tax cut as is possible, and in particular, as large a cut in the marriage penalty as possible. 
Finally, I would like to state my willingness to work in a bipartisan way with my colleagues across the aisle in providing the type of tax relief that I know we both want to give married couples laboring under this oppressive Tax Code. 
A couple of days ago, some of my colleagues were on the floor demanding that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board begin to implement expansionary monetary policy by cutting interest rates. Cutting interest rates would incentivize investment and act as a stabilizing effect on many worldwide financial markets now teetering under a cloud of uncertainty. 
I think that is good, that the Federal Reserve should consider moving towards a more expansionist monetary policy, but I don't think we should require the Fed to do that. I believe we should let the Federal Reserve do its job and we should concentrate on doing our job. If Congress has the will to enact progrowth fiscal policy, I suggest it begin to do so by enacting the largest tax cut possible so we can help stimulate the financial markets, help in this uncertain financial situation that we have, and continue the growth taking place. 
We have a unique opportunity to substantially change our Tax Code treatment of married people. We can do so without touching the Social Security trust fund. There are other people who want to spend that money. I think we need to leave the money alone, create a real Social Security trust fund, and at the same time let's give people a little bit of their money back with a tax cut. The House has done this. Let's work together, let's push to finally be able to get some of that tax relief put in place. 
Last year, we cut taxes for the first time in 16 years. We need to continue that effort to cut taxes to continue to stimulate the economy, to continue to give people back a little bit of their money. We should start with married two-wage-earner couples who are being penalized by a Tax Code that doesn't make any sense at this point. 
So I urge my colleagues, let's work with the House and make this tax cut a reality. We can do it. We have spent a year talking about spending. Let's take a few days to talk about tax cuts.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, which is the pending business at this point in time. 
I commend the hard work of Senator Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee for crafting this much-needed reform of our bankruptcy laws. Bankruptcy filings rose to almost 1.4 million last year. That is up from 172,000 in just 1978--enormous growth in bankruptcy filings. More than 70 percent of those who filed for bankruptcy last year did so under chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code, which erases most debt incurred. 
The cost of these bankruptcies to the U.S. economy last year has been estimated at more than $44 billion--enormous cost. And these losses are passed on to consumers, costing every household that pays its bills $400 in hidden taxes. That is not fair to the millions of families who pay their bills--mortgages, car loans, student loans, and credit card tabs--every month. 
This legislation goes a long way in addressing the fraud and abuse of our bankruptcy system while ensuring that people who are in considerable economic pain will be protected. 
However, I am extremely concerned about a provision in this bill which places a cap on the homestead exemption. My State of Kansas has a homestead law in our State constitution dating back to 1859. Many farmers have used this law during times of economic hardship to protect their farms, their homes and their 160 acres. While the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act exempts family farmers from the homestead provision, many small farmers would not qualify under the bankruptcy code as a family farm because they or their spouse earn off-farm taxable income. 
I might note for my fellow Members that over half of the people involved in agriculture today in my State and in many States across the country have considerable off-farm income from either themselves or their spouses and yet are full-time involved in agriculture. They have the outside income for various numbers of reasons, but this provision will not allow them to qualify for that agricultural exemption, the family farm exemption, if it remains as we have it in this particular act. 
Many farming States have similar homestead laws dating back frequently to the time of statehood and of the settling of many places in the Midwest, where people could keep their home and 160 acres if they would just settle this land for a period of 5 years. That is the basis of this homestead law. This provision that is in the bankruptcy code and the changes that we have before us today could have a significant impact on farmers who are already faced with cash flow problems caused by low commodity prices. 
This bill also does not take into consideration the vastly different property values in various States that will be affected by this particular homestead provision. 
While I believe we should prevent fraud and abuse of our bankruptcy system, preempting State homestead laws and imposing a one-size-fits-all approach is not the answer. I hope that my colleagues will consider this as we look forward in dealing with this provision and working together with the House to get a fine Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act put together. We should not penalize, we should not usurp, the States that have put forward a particular homestead exemption. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his work and his effort in this area. I want to talk in the brief period of time that I have about the soul of a nation, the soul of our Nation and what happens to it when, once pierced with consciousness that this procedure goes on, allows it to continue to go on. 
Government-sanctioned brutality presently exists in America in the form of partial-birth abortion. We know that now. The cold mechanics of partial-birth abortion involve the near delivery of a late-term infant to facilitate the extraction of the child's brains. This procedure will be performed several times this month throughout our Nation, and we know that, and we know that we sanction that as a State-sanctioned form of death. 
I speak today of deep concern for the soul of our Nation which is permitting these defiling acts to continue with our consent. Why do otherwise decent nations permit their young to be ripped apart? Why do they permit the shameless repeated acts of cruelty against their weakest and most vulnerable? People of conscience must intervene now. 
I draw attention of the people here in this body to the words that adorn the doorways as we walk in. As you preside, you stare up at the words, `In God we trust.' As you look across the walkway, `He, God, has smiled on our undertakings.' Above this doorway we have `A new order for the ages.' All thoughts of our founders; all thoughts, I think, they had towards the newborn child, towards any nature of life in this Nation, that, `In God we trust.' 
With a nation of such a conscience and such a soul, would it tolerate such a procedure once it knows that this procedure exists? I think not. I urge my colleagues, as we look at this, as we consider the soul of our Nation, would we, should we, can we continue to tolerate this outrageous form of death? History teaches us that tolerated acts of cruelty both brand a nation for infamy and sear its conscience. Tolerance is complicity, and nations will eventually be judged for their failure to stop the course of unbridled cruelty. 
America is distinguished around the world basically because of one phrase: America is distinguished for her goodness. I don't think we can excuse this act. No adequate excuse exists for the death of an innocent child by this horrific surgical procedure. This is a human rights abuse of the basest form, which, if condoned, will singe the soul of our Nation now that we know it exists. 
We must force ourselves to look squarely into the face of this brutality, regardless of the many sophisticated arguments. I close with a quote from Edward R. Murrow on this point. He would say: `There are not two sides to every story.' There are not two sides to this story. Partial-birth abortion must be banned. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Enzi-Sessions amendment which ensures that the Secretary of Interior does not circumvent Congress and the States in gaming on Indian lands. It would also extend the moratorium on expansion of gambling on tribal lands. 
The growth of the gambling industry in this country in recent years has been explosive. Twenty years ago, only two States allowed casino gambling. Today, the industry reins in $40 billion each year in 23 States and generates revenues that are six times the revenue from all American spectator sports combined. The amount of money wagered annually in the United States exceeds $500 billion. 
It concerns me that this explosive growth in the gambling industry has taken place during the same time period that so many other aspects of our culture have declined. Two years ago, Congress enacted PL-104-169, which established the National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission for the purpose of studying the social and economic impact of gambling and reporting its findings to Congress. I supported that legislation. In fact, not one member in either the House nor the Senate rose in opposition to that legislation. This I believe, illustrates the need Congress has to gather more information on the implications of the extraordinary growth of the gaming industry. Until the findings of the Commission are available to guide the actions of Congress, I simply believe that it is reasonable for Congress to not take any action that may proliferate a problem in our society until the ramifications are better understood. 
The problems correlated with gambling are serious. Increased family violence, child abuse, suicide, white collar crime, alcohol abuse, prostitution, drug activities, and organized crime have all been linked to gambling. Furthermore, I am concerned about the destructive societal impact of compulsive gamblers. Compulsive gamblers will bet their entire savings and anything of value that can be sold or borrowed against while neglecting family responsibilities to pursue the short-lived thrill of betting. They are more likely to abuse their spouses and their children, and most have contemplated suicide. Compounding these problems, there is speculation that the gambling industry actually targets these vulnerable individuals as well as another faction of vulnerable individuals--the poor. 
And, the economic benefits promised to communities which open their doors to gambling are often exaggerated. On the contrary, some municipalities have found that casinos flourished at the expense of existing businesses, and that the incidences of theft and larceny increased.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am a proud sponsor of the Child Custody Protection Act, which makes it a Federal offense to transport a minor across State lines to obtain an abortion in circumvention of State parental notification laws. Good laws, constitutionally-tested laws, have been enacted in over 20 States which require parental participation, or judicial involvement, in a minor's abortion decision. Yet, these same laws are flagrantly breached by nonfamily adults who secretly transport young, pregnant girls in complete disregard of her parents' knowledge or participation. I think this is wrong, and I believe most parents would agree with me. 
The Child Custody Protection Act is really a family values bill which preserves the parental right to oversee their child's medical treatment of the most intrusive kind--namely, that of abortion. This bill is about choosing to support parents, rather than unrelated strangers, in their State-recognized right to care for a vulnerable, at-risk daughter. Is this too much to ask? Even ear-piercing for minors requires parental authorization, let alone this most disturbing surgical procedure. 
Abortion, I believe, is in a class by itself and is unlike any other medical procedure, for both strikingly emotional and physical reasons. There is no other surgery like it, where the object is to terminate a developing human life, and the emotional repercussions can be devastating. Women who have experienced abortion are haunted by the unspeakably weighty consequences of lost life and the deep emotional conflicts this produces. Add to this terrible mix the factor of youthful vulnerability and you invite extreme emotional trauma. 
Also, abortion can have unique physical consequences--rendering a young girl physically traumatized and even infertile from a bungled operation. Most alarmingly, some `absconding' adults can exhibit the extremes of irresponsibility and disregard for the physical well-being of their `charges.' There are tragic examples of young women who have been plied with alcohol, raped, impregnated, and then taken across State lines for secret abortions. Some of these cases are just so horrific that one can't even really repeat them. 
We simply don't want strangers interfering with this important parental responsibility, which is already protected by several States. We must honor the fact that parents have a unique legal status of in loco parentis, which is a historic common law charge to protect their child's well-being. Don't let this right be eroded by unfettered abortion activists with baseless constitutional law claims. To do otherwise is an assault against the precious institution of `family,' which we prize and which has been harmed and is a fundamental foundation for our culture and this society. 
Let's help, and not hinder, parents in their difficult and crucial job in an otherwise potentially disastrous situation. Let's not allow parental rights and family ties to be further eroded. Let's support the wisdom of these 20-plus States which have already done the hard work of safeguarding unwed, pregnant children by requiring parental notification. In short, let's support family values by passing this Child Custody Protection Act. 
Mr. President, this is a commonsense act. If you are going to allow--and we have--parents to have the responsibility over a child in getting their ears pierced, my goodness, shouldn't we have the responsibility for a parent, or a court, to get involved if an abortion is going to take place across State lines? Shouldn't we honor these States for their efforts in the devolution of power? Shouldn't we honor those 20 States that have decided to go differently on this and require the parental notification to take place? This just makes sense throughout our constitutional system, throughout our Federal system, and throughout our family system. The foundational unit of this Government is the family. We should not further erode that responsibility. For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to help and support in the passage of this Child Custody Protection Act. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a subject that is both extraordinarily difficult and painful. In times of international turmoil, the Nation should rally behind our leaders, and we are in the midst of such times. But President Clinton's abdication of the duties of leadership has made this impossible. The report of the independent counsel is now under seal. When its contents are released to the Members of Congress, questions of criminal wrongdoing will unavoidably dominate this branch of government. 
The Congress must determine whether the President will be impeached. I will not prejudge that question. As a Member of the body that will deliberate on this issue, I believe it is important to have access to all the evidence before reaching a conclusion on the issue of impeachment. Rather, I rise today to respectfully ask President Clinton to do the right thing for our country and resign from his office voluntarily. 
There are three reasons why I believe this has become necessary at this point in time. 
First, the President's conduct has all but destroyed his ability to lead as head of state and Commander in Chief. 
Second, the President's actions have been corrosive to our national character and have debased the Office of the Presidency. 
Third, President Clinton should spare our Nation the debilitating spectacle of impeachment hearings. 
Over the last several weeks, we have witnessed the disastrous consequences abroad of diminished American leadership. There are some who have said that the President's conduct is purely a private matter. They are wrong. Private 
actions have public consequences. They do for all of us, but especially the President of the United States. In all of governance, but with foreign policy in particular, credibility is everything. Weakness is provocative; deceit can be deadly. When American foreign policy is unpredictable, our allies are unreliable, and tyrants are emboldened. These hypothetical dangers have become tragic realities. 
Yesterday afternoon, I chaired a hearing on U.S. foreign policy in Iraq, for instance, and we heard from Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.N. Special Representative; James Woolsey, former CIA Director; and Lawrence Eagleburger, former Secretary of State. What we heard was deeply distressing. It appears that the President's policy toward Iraq consists of paying lipservice to the importance of comprehensive and unrestricted weapons inspections and then preventing the arms inspectors from carrying out their mission. 
Such abdication of leadership leaves Saddam Hussein free to build weapons of mass destruction, thus jeopardizing the security of our troops, our allies in the region, and ultimately the United States itself. Nor is Iraq the only nation that has thumbed its nose at a weakened United States. 
Around the world, rogue nations are violating fundamental human rights, waging wars of aggression, and flouting international treaties. Our ability to deter these acts has been sadly compromised by an absence of leadership, a total lack of credibility. Enemies of our values and interests have judged the President's ability to lead the United States and have found it wanting. As a result, the world is a much more dangerous place. 
Second, the President's actions have squandered his moral authority to lead at home. The problems of family breakdown and moral decay are the most significant that we face. Just one comes glaringly out into mind: that nearly 30 percent of our children born in this country are born to single moms, many of whom are teenagers having children. 
Can the President, with the problems he has today, lead our fight in that area? The President cannot address these problems when he himself has contributed to the decay. One of the privileges and obligations of high office is to act as a role model for children. We need our President to set an example to be admired, not to be avoided. The President's ongoing adultery with an intern of barely legal age, misuse of the Oval Office, and repeated lies from he and his staff have done enormous damage to the body politic. Unfortunately, at the very time when most need strength, focused resolve, and moral leadership from our President, he has been unable to supply it. We live in a volatile world with very real dangers and very difficult problems. We cannot afford to let these dangers go unnoticed and problems unresolved by a President unable to lead. 
I say all of this with great respect and with deep regret. President Clinton is a talented man who believes in America and has spent his life serving others. 
Yet his immoral indiscretion, and months of lies to the Nation have tarnished his leadership ability beyond repair. None of us are without sin. But the high call of leadership demands a certain moral authority that by the President's own actions is now lost. 
There is a final point to be made. Very soon the contents of the independent counsel's report will be made known publicly. The contents of this report will result in impeachment proceedings. Such hearings will surely take a heavy toll on the function of our government, on the trust invested in our civic institutions, and on the American people themselves. President Clinton could spare us this ordeal. He could quickly and decisively enable our Nation to put this sorry chapter in our history behind us and to move on. But at this point there is only one way for him to do that. Sadly and reluctantly, I have concluded that the only way for us to move forward as a Nation is for the President to resign. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this afternoon I was not present for a vote to table the McCain Amendment No. 3500. Had I been present, I would have voted against the tabling motion. I was absent because I was presenting, posthumously, Mother Theresa's Congressional Gold Medal, which is just now available. The replicas are available from the U.S. Mint. It was a tremendous tribute to a wonderful lady, Mother Theresa, who passed away a year ago September 5, as we remembered her today. My vote would not have changed the outcome of the vote on this motion.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as we confirm the nomination of Mr. Jack Lew to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, I want to take this opportunity to highlight a problem that OMB has the power to help correct, but to this date has chosen not to. 
As many are aware, there is a real problem right now in rural America brought about the dismal farm prices. The only way that commodity prices are going to increase is to boost exports. Certainly, passage of Fast Track, funding of the IMF, continuing normal trade relations with China, and lifting sanctions are necessary parts of the strategy to grow our export markets. 
However, there is also a tool, the Export Enhancement Program, that the federal government can be using to help boost exports and revive farm exports in the near term. Congress has done its part in providing appropriations for this program, but the Administration has failed to utilize the program. 
The EEP program is designed to help our agricultural exports compete in the face of subsidized competition in international markets. Despite clear evidence that subsidized competition is eroding U.S. markets, particularly for wheat flour, the Administration has been dragging its feet in initiating the EEP. 
The USDA has been pushing for the use of the Export Enhancement Program for wheat flour for almost two years. However, before the program can be initiated, an interagency review group, of which OMB is a member, must approve the initiative. OMB has not endorsed usage of the Export Enhancement Program to counteract European subsidies for wheat flour, and thus has effectively blocked use of the program. 
It is objectionable that the Clinton Administration is not compelled to stand up for its farm community in the face of adversity in the same way that its European counterparts are. Secondly, it is objectionable that the OMB is driving agricultural trade policy, instead of the Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the U.S. Trade Representative. 
Exports of U.S. wheat flour have come to a virtual standstill, and it is not because U.S. farmers and millers are relatively inefficient. It is because our competitors, namely the European Union, highly subsidize flour milling. The Administration has the power to correct this by using our own export subsidy program, but OMB is preventing it. 
The Administration has announced its intention to purchase wheat and donate it overseas for humanitarian purposes. This is a fine idea, but it is not a substitute for an initiative that will target commercial markets. The EEP program can be used in countries that pay cash for the wheat flour they consume and that do not qualify for humanitarian assistance. These are important markets that the U.S. wheat industry has spent years developing. Furthermore, using the EEP to leverage sales will allow USDA to facilitate a larger amount of wheat flour sales using fewer federal dollars that it would through a donation program. 
The EEP is needed not only because it wall help us regain our commercial presence in markets traditionally held by the U.S., but also because it will increase our leverage in future trade negotiations. The real objective here needs to be to eliminate export subsidies worldwide. However, our competitors have no reason to come to the negotiating table if the U.S. has already unilaterally eliminated export subsidies. 
The Export Enhancement Program needs to be utilized now for wheat flour. I encourage Mr. Lew to make that a priority when he enters office.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, on December 10, 1948--nearly 50 years ago--the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and called on member nations `to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded . . . ` Since that time, the Universal Declaration has become the bedrock document for human rights standards and aspirations for signatory governments. 
One government, however, the government of Iran, is distinguished as an egregious violator of a central principle this document expounds--namely, that of religious freedom. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration explicitly states: `Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.' 
On Tuesday, July 21st, the Iranian government summarily executed an Iranian Baha'i for the single alleged act of converting a Muslim to the Baha'i faith. The Baha'is are Iran's largest religious minority with about 300,000 adherents and suffer continuous persecution for their faith. 
The executed, Mr. Ruhollah Rowhani, a medical equipment salesman with four children, had been picked-up near the northern Iranian city of Mashad by the Iranian authorities in September 1997. He was held in solitary confinement during that extended period until final execution. 
The facts are stark in their cruelty. His family was allowed to visit him briefly the day before his execution but, amazingly and cynically, they were not notified that his execution was set for the next day. They finally discovered the death only after they were given one hour to arrange for his burial. With brutal disregard, the Iranian government refused to divulge any information to this grieving family who were forced to conclude from the rope marks that their beloved relative had been executed by hanging. 
It is safe to say that Mr. Rowhani was accorded no due process nor afforded a lawyer prior to his execution. He died alone at the end of a rope for the alleged sin of sharing his sincerely held faith. I will state this very clearly--Mr. Rowhani was the victim of the most extreme form of religious persecution. Mr. Rowhani died for his faith and this is an outrage which must be denounced. 
Mr. President, this barbarous act flies in the face of the Universal Declaration to which Iran is party. Mr. Rowhani had a fundamental right to practice his religion. Iran denied him that right. Mr. Rowhani had a fundamental right to a public trial. Iran denied him that right. Mr. Rowhani had a fundamental right to counsel. Iran denied him that right. Mr. Rowhani had a fundamental right to NOT be hung at the end of a rope for holding minority religious beliefs. 
My deepest concern now rests with the fifteen other Baha'is now being held by the government of Iran for essentially the same charges that resulted in Mr. Rowhani's execution. As I speak now, at least three Baha'i men in the city of Mashad presently sit on death row, facing imminent execution because they dared to quietly celebrate their faith. I speak as much for them today as I do in protest to the brutal killing of their fellow-believer. 
This hour, I call on the Government of Iran to ensure the safety of these individuals. Better yet, I call for the release of these individuals whose only crime was the sincere expression of their faith, which happens to be a minority religion. Most importantly, I call upon the government of Iran to provide freedom of religion to its people, including the famously peaceful yet brutalized Baha'is community. 
I want to take this opportunity to commend the international community for its swift response to Mr. Rowhani's execution and urge other governments and organizations to vigilantly monitor the fate of the 15 jailed Baha'is, particularly the 3 jailed in Mashad presently facing the death penalty. 
Religious persecution demands a tireless counter response; it demands a vigilant defense. If we hold the principle of religious freedom to be a precious and fundamental right, something worth protecting, then we must always defend those who are wrongfully and brutally crushed for their faith by hostile national governments. 
We cannot bring Mr. Rowhani back or right the wrong that was done to him and his family, but we can advocate against this happening again. Iran must abide by global human rights principles. Accordingly, Iran must release the fifteen Bahai who have been incarcerated for their faith. Iran must preserve the lives of those facing execution for their faith. Iran must honor its commitment to the religious freedom principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and set these prisoners free.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about Georgia and the recent events which have taken place in this impressive country. Several days ago, Georgia reaffirmed its commitment to full participatory democracy when the Minister of State requested the resignation of all cabinet ministers, and then resigned himself. His resignation was accepted, and President Eduard Shevardnadze has vowed to reconstitute a new government by the middle of August. This transition, so reminiscent of the ebb and flow of governments in great parliamentary democracies, has been accomplished without violence or bloodshed, without chaos or confusion, and with the support of the Georgian people. Truly Georgia is an inspiration to peoples everywhere who long for democracy and who struggle against the freedom-stifling legacy of the communist experiment. 
Georgia is impressive in other ways as well. Its economy continues to grow in a positive direction, unlike the economies of some of its neighbors; Georgia is not perfect, and it is not pristine. But it is progressive. With a growth rate of nearly 8 percent in 1997 and projected growth of 11-13 percent in 1998, Georgia is on track to a significant economic turn-around. 
This turn-around and the prosperity that will inevitably flow from it, still involve many hurdles. Georgians have bravely faced these challenges, and they face more still. Probably none is so painful as the ongoing conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia's most northwestern province bordering Russia. This brutal brushfire war has now claimed lives unnecessarily on both sides, and it must be ended. Mr. President, the CIS peacekeepers are a major part of the problem and the reason the war continues. 
As the Times of London noted on July 27th, Georgia accepted the CIS peacekeepers only under duress, because the UN blinked. These CIS peacekeepers, the Times points out, have not exactly distinguished themselves by their impartiality. They are `entirely drawn from the Russian Army, and commanded from Russian, not CIS, headquarters. Of its four battalions, one fought the Georgians in the 1992-93 war, while another two are recruited from anti-Georgia nationalities.' It is hard to imagine that this formula can create anything but conflict, and indeed, there have been constant complaints from Georgia that these so-called peacekeepers are merely part of a Russian strategy to destabilize Georgia, a strategy that includes several assassination attempts on President Shevardnadze. 
From the beginning, the Abkhaz conflict has been widely acknowledged to be Russia's doing. The separatists who want to break off Abkhazia from Georgia are provoked, fueled and encouraged by the Russians. Georgia has offered Abkhazia full autonomy, an offer that has been answered by Russian guns. 
As early as 1992 Russia provided the Abkhazians with weapons to conduct the war, and the Russian government today supports the Abkhaz leadership in its unwillingness to bring the conflict to a close through negotiation. One member of the Abkhaz leadership wrote in the Russian nationalist press in 1992 that `Abkhazia is Russia.' Since then, Russia has managed to scuttle all budding negotiations, even while serving as the putative `mediator' at the recent Geneva talks between the Georgians and Abkhazians, and it has unfailingly sided with the Abkhaz against Georgia at the infrequent bargaining tables and on the battlefield. 
Let us be frank: These Russian peacekeepers do not want peace. Rather, they seek to extend the hostilities so that Georgia will find it difficult to consolidate its hold over this breakaway region. These so-called peacekeepers have helped to create thousands of dead on both sides; they have created massive flows of Georgian refugees by turning a blind eye toward some of the most blatant ethnic cleansing anywhere in the world; and they have allowed the devastation of what is arguably one of the richest and most beautiful parts of the Georgian state. 
Abkhaz leaders, with Russia's help, have perpetrated one of the world's most egregious examples of ethnic cleansing. Tens of thousands of Georgians have been forced out of their homes in Abkhazia and turned into homeless, hungry refugees. Georgia's many requests in recent years to the United Nations to condemn this blatant genocide have fallen on deaf ears, and most Georgians now attribute the Abkhazians' continued use of ethnic cleansing to UN inaction. Georgia has once again asked the UN to intervene in Abkhazia, but its willingness to do so, especially with Russia holding a seat on the Security Council, is in doubt. 
How is it possible that ethnic cleansing can high behind a transparent veil of `peacekeeping'? Why has the UN shirked its duty to protect these vulnerable Georgians, when it seems willing, even eager, to condemn genocide elsewhere in the world? Where is the indignation and outrage from our statesmen? Where are the legions of human rights advocates that usually visit the corridors of our departments and ministries? 
The Abkhazians (who constitute less than 20 percent of the population of the region they claim as their own) and their Russian supporters, should harbor no illusions about the ultimate outcome of this struggle: Abkhazia will remain part of Georgia. The Georgian government will never acquiesce in territorial claims on its historic territory, and the US government will never support such claims. Meanwhile, Abkhazians are poised to miss what could be one of the most exciting periods in the development of the South Caucasus. The opening of energy pipelines from the Caspian will create unprecedented opportunities for growth and development, and the forging of the Eurasian Transport Corridor, the New Silk Road, which originates in Georgia, foretells a future in which all Georgians, including Abkhazians, should prosper. 
Those of my colleagues who have traveled to Georgia know of the immense beauty of the country, and the kindness and generosity of its people. They know of the Georgians' will in the face of numerous obstacles and barriers. And, increasingly, they understand why and where Georgia's interests intersect with America's interests. 
Put simply, Georgia is a key strategic ally for America in a region in which America has few strategic anchors. America has a strong national interest in encouraging a close and multifaceted relationship with Georgia. Though small, poor and weak, Georgia has the potential to be small, yet rich and strong. It is in our best interest to promote this transition with American aid, American power and American prayers.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the amendment we have offered would eliminate the marriage penalty, and that is an item of discussion we want to discuss this morning--the Senator from Missouri and myself. A number of people have been involved in this discussion. The Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, has been one of the leading proponents of this particular issue of doing away with the marriage penalty. 
Our amendment to eliminate the marriage penalty, which is being cosponsored by Senator Ashcroft, Senator Inhofe, Senator Grams, would reinstate income splitting and provide married couples who currently labor under the onerous burden of our Tax Code with much needed relief. 
Our amendment doubles the standard deduction for married couples. It is a very simple amendment. It doubles the standard deduction for married couples. 
Currently, the single standard deduction is $4,150, while the marriage standard deduction is only $6,900. Our amendment would raise the standard deduction for all married couples to $8,300, precisely double what it currently is for single people. 
That is just the heart and soul--that is the guts of what this is about. We are trying to make the field the same for married couples as it is for singles. We think this will send a powerful signal to the institution of marriage that is central to family involvement in this country and saying that if you get married, we are not going to tax you more than if you are single living together. 
That is the simple statement here. You ask people across the country, Is this a good thing to do? And they clearly say, yes. It makes no sense that right now we tax married couples, tax two-wage-earner families more than we do single individuals. This much needed amendment would provide hard-working American families with the tax relief they deserve but have not gotten from this Congress. 
Over the past month, the Senate has considered several spending bills, bills which increase the size of Government and which call upon the taxpayers to yield even more of their personal income to the Federal Government. 
As many of my colleagues know, during consideration of the budget resolution, I, along with several of my colleagues, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Hutchison, Senator Inhofe, Senator Smith, Senator Grams, called for larger tax cuts to be considered this year. Unfortunately, it appears with only a little amount of time left in this session that we are running out of time. 
We have to put this issue forward now. We need to give the American taxpayers relief. We ought to have the integrity to keep our promises to the American people by eliminating the marriage penalty this session. The Senate leader has been very supportive of this effort. This is his top priority as well, to eliminate the marriage penalty. The American people sent us to Congress to lower taxes and to cut Government spending. And this Congress has gotten some of that done, but not enough. Clearly, we need to keep moving forward on tax cuts. Let us get our work done now and let us get it done for the American people. 
Unfortunately, because we have failed to get a resolution that calls for elimination of the marriage penalty, I am offering this amendment, along with five of my colleagues, in order to give the taxpayers the relief they deserve. 
Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will be calling for the yeas and nays. I just want to make a point about what this amendment does. We currently have in our Tax Code that if you have a two-wage-earner family, and their combined income is between $22,000 and $70,000, you have what is called effectively a marriage penalty. You pay more tax if you exist in this category--a two-wage-earner family between $22,000 and $70,000--you pay more tax than if the two people would just live together. It is called the marriage penalty. It amounts to about $150 billion over a 5-year time period that we are taxing people. 
I have letters here, testimonials of people who said, `You know what? We were thinking about getting married, and then we couldn't because of the tax structure that was penalizing us for getting married.' 
Listen to this gentleman. He is from Columbus, OH, a gentleman by the name of Thomas, who I will leave out his last name. 
Thank you so much for addressing this issue. I am engaged to be married and my fiance and I have discussed the fact that we will be penalized financially. We have postponed the date of our marriage in order to save up and have a `running start' in part because of this nasty, unfair tax structure. 
There are two economists in this country who every year get divorced at the end of the year so that they can file separately and then are married the first part of the next year and then use the money to have a celebration with. Is that the sort of tax policy that we should have in America that encourages that type of situation to take place? 
This is a lady from Alberton, MT: 
My husband and I both work. We are 50 and 55 years old. This is a second marriage for both of us. We delayed our marriage for a number of years because of the tax consequences, and lived together. I caused a great deal of stress and lots of anguish amongst our family as this was not the way we were raised. We finally took the tax hit-- 
Listen to that-- 
We finally took the tax hit and married to make my family happy. This marriage penalty is awful! 
That is from Alberton, MT, that that couple writes. 
Is that the sort of thing we want to encourage our couples to be a part of or to have that sort of difficulty? 
I just don't think so. 
This one from Iowa: `I think the marriage penalty is an outrage, yet another way the government stops us from being moral citizens.' Can you believe that? They are writing, it `stops us from being moral citizens.' 
`I really hope this bill passes. I'm taxed enough as it is. I don't mind paying taxes, but enough is enough.' That is Joe from Des Moines, IA, writing that. 
This from Wichita, KS, my home State: `I appreciate you helping me and millions of other Americans.' And I should mention, this affects 21 million American families--21 million American families--many of them just getting started as family members. `I appreciate your helping me and millions of other Americans who are struggling to keep their families together. I work full time for county government. My wife is a stay at home mom who works. I have four children and it is a challenge to pay the bills but we still do it. It would help us if the government helped us and killed the marriage penalty. A fair tax system would certainly be helpful to us.' 
They go on and on. I have pages of people who are writing in about the marriage penalty and the impact that it has had upon them. Listen to this from Union, KY: `Before we set a wedding date, I calculated the tax implications. Since we each earned in the low $30,000s, the Federal marriage penalty [was how this gentleman cited it] was over $3,000. What a wonderful gift from the IRS.' Are those the sort of gifts we want to send? 
This is from Indiana: `I can't tell you how disgusted we both are over this tax issue. If we get married, not only would I forfeit my $900 refund check, we would be writing a check to the IRS for $2,800. Darrell and I would very much like to be married and I must say it break our hearts to find out we can't afford it.' Can't afford to get married, thanks to the marriage penalty. 
From Ohio: `I'm engaged to be married and my fiance and I have discussed the fact that we will be penalized financially.' 
Here is from Baltimore, MD: `I am a 23-year-old, a marriage penalty victim for 4 years now. I'm a union electrician who works hard to put food on the table to take care of my family.' Then he asks a simple question: `Why is the government punishing me just because I'm married?' 
That is a simple question that Senator Ashcroft from Missouri and I and a number of other people ask who want to do away with this most onerous, wrongheaded, bad signal of a tax. That is the marriage penalty. That is why we are putting this bill forward here today, to deal with this particular situation. It is time we do it. 
I want to address one other topic on this before allowing other Senators to speak, because I know a number want to address this particular issue; that is, whether or not we can pay for this issue. Let me say simply we can pay for this issue and wall off all the payments coming to Social Security that are in surplus for Social Security. You are going to hear a number of people attacking from the other side, saying we cannot do this because it will take from Social Security. Then they try to pit Social Security against marriage. It is a false choice. 
We can preserve the entire flow of resources going to Social Security, the entire payroll tax, and do this marriage penalty lifting, which ought to be done for a positive signal and for the working families of this country. 
CBO last week said we had $520 billion surplus they projected over the next 5 years--$520 billion. We are talking, with this particular marriage penalty, just over $151 billion. So about $1.5 out of $5. Any surplus that is coming into Social Security we wall off and we say that should go to Social Security, and we can do it. Do not listen to the other side saying we are taking from Social Security to deal with the marriage penalty. We are not. We don't have to do it that way. We are not doing it that way. I do not support doing it that way. 
We support keeping Social Security safe and sound, and any flow of resources into Social Security stays in there. We should create a real trust fund and actually put the resources there. We can and we should. I believe we must, for the foundational institution of this democracy, the family, and particularly the marriage, do this repealing of this marriage penalty that penalizes two-wage-earner families making between $22,000 and $70,000. Many of those are newlywed, starting a family, with young children involved. This involves 21 million American families. It is time we do away with this terrible tax penalty. 
At a later date, I will respond to some of the accusations I think will probably be coming from the other side. The Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, has been a key champion of this particular issue, as I have noted, and a number of other people have as well, including Senator Hutchison of Texas, and I know they want to speak on this particular issue. 
I yield to the Senator from Missouri on this particular amendment.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to give a couple of facts and some figures that I think are important to have. 
The average marriage penalty in this country for people who are paying the marriage penalty is just over $1,400 a year; $1,425 a year is the average amount that families are paying for the marriage penalty in America. I think that is just far too high. 
It may not seem like a lot to some people. But in paying electric bills, you could pay an average one for over 9 months. For some families, it would pay for a week-long vacation at Disneyland. It would make four payments on a minivan. You can go out to dinner, buy over 1,000 gallons of gasoline, you can buy over 1,200 loaves of bread. Those are important things to do with $1,425. 
I want to show this chart to my colleagues as well. There are some who suggested last time when we entered into this debate that there is also a marriage bonus, and that if you will do away with the marriage bonus, we will do away with the marriage penalty. I have no problem whatsoever giving a bonus to people who are married. I think that we should honor this institution, and if they want to propose raising taxes on people who are married, they can go ahead and do so. I oppose that. 
But I want to show who it hits. Again, you are talking about the highest proportion of the marriage penalty going to those families when the higher-earning spouse is making somewhere between $20,000 and $75,000. These are middle-income, a lot of times just starting to be wage-earner families, and it hits two-wage-earner families as well. 
These are the people that we should be trying to help out the absolute most. I just find it a completely wrongheaded policy, at a time when we are struggling so much in this country with the set of values we are putting forward, to say we are not only going to not help people making between $20,000 and $75,000, or are just starting a family, we are actually going to tax them, we are going to tax them more.

Mr. BROWNBACK. The Senator raises a good consideration. We don't know the number of marriages that would be saved. But we do know that a lot of times people know this tax is on them. I think too many times my colleagues think people don't really know this tax exists on them, and that it exists there, but it is not a real tax, it is not one that anybody cites to. But we found, time and time again, people act rationally. They act economically rationally. So if you send a signal that you are going to tax something, they will do less of it. And if you send a signal you are going to subsidize something, they do more of it. So we tax marriage, and what do you think happens in that type of situation where you put more financial pressure on the family? The $1,445 is the average. There are some that are taxed substantially more. 
I read to my colleagues, and the Senator from Missouri, letters from a number of people who have written in and said, `I cannot believe you guys would talk about family values, all of you, everybody saying that families are critical, families are important, yet here is such a classic example of where you are penalizing the family, and it still exists, and you guys are still talking about family values.' 
One thing I am very pleased about is the majority leader, Trent Lott, has been a strong proponent of doing away with this marriage penalty because he knows the importance of what this is about. He knows people act economically rationally and is supportive of this debate and is supportive of our efforts to try to get the marriage penalty done away with. I think it is important, and he has cited to it as well. This is not for high-wage-earning families, I point out to my colleagues as well. We are talking about hitting families the most where the highest earning spouse earns somewhere between $20,000 and $75,000. That is important. 
Just because some of these testimonials are so touching, I want to read some more of them to my colleagues, because I think they are very, very telling. This is not just about statistics. This is not just about economists saying this has an impact. This is about real people looking at their real situation of real taxes they are paying. Listen to this one--Steve from Tennessee: 
My wife and I got married on January 1, 1997. We were going to have a Christmas wedding last year, but after talking to my accountant, we saw that instead of both of us getting money back on our taxes, we were going to have to pay in, so we postponed it. Now, after getting married, we have to have more taken out of our checks just to break even and not get a refund. We got penalized for getting married. 
And then he says something that I think is prophetic and simple and straightforward. He just says, `. . . and that is just not right.' 
That is our point with this tax. We have the wherewithal to pay for it in the surplus. We will not touch Social Security surpluses coming into it. And this tax `is just not right.' 
Here is one from Dayton, OH: 
Penalizing for marriage flies in the face of common sense. This is a classic example of government policy not supporting that which it wishes to promote. In our particular situation, [he gives us his own situation] my girlfriend and I would incur a net annual penalty of $2,000, or approximately $167 per month. Though not huge, this is enough to pay our monthly phone, cable, water and home insurance bills. 
We may sit here and look at this and say $2,000 a year, $167 a month, that is not a big deal--it is a big deal. It is a big signal we are sending to families that we are going to tax you and penalize you if you decide to get married. People act economically rational. They are going to look at this and they will understand it. They will also act economically rational if we say we are doing away with this marriage penalty. We think this is a bad tax, bad tax policy. It is not a place that we ought to tax, and they will act rationally there as well, and it sends a signal to families. 
This is one I thought was excellent, from Marietta, GA. 
We always file as `married filing separately' because that saves us about $500 a year over `married filing jointly.' When we figured our 1996 return, just out of curiosity, we figured what our tax would be if we lived together instead of married. Imagine our disgust when we discovered that, if we just lived together instead of being married, we would have saved an additional $1,000. So much for the much vaunted `family values' of our government. Our government is sending a very bad message to young adults by penalizing marriage this way. 
That is from Bobby and Susan in Marietta, GA. 
Is that the sort of signal we want to send? Listen to this one from Ohio: 
No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another example of how, in the past 40 years the federal government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start. 
That is Thomas from Ohio that writes that in. 
I have studies here. We have Joint Economic Committee studies of the impact of a marriage penalty. We have studies from other institutions, citing about the marriage penalty. None of them could put it more succinctly than Thomas has right here: `This is but another example of a policy that has broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start.' 
Let us hear the people. Let us hear their cry. Let us hear them say what they are saying to us, that this is a wrongheaded idea, what we are doing. 
This one, David from Indiana:  
This is one of the most unfair laws that is on the books. I have been married for more than 23 years and would really like to see this injustice changed [And then he says, not for himself, but, he says] so my sons will not have to face this additional tax. Please keep up the great work. We need more people in office who are interested in families. 
Then this one from North Carolina: 
It is unfortunate that the government makes a policy against the noble and sacred institution of marriage. 
Here is somebody, Andrew from North Carolina, who is looking at his Federal Government and he says: 
It is unfortunate the government makes a policy against the noble and sacred institution of marriage. I also feel it is unfortunate it seems to hit young, struggling couples the hardest. 
Let us hear the people. Let us hear their sense of what they are saying about this particular situation, about this particular tax that is in place. 
This gentleman, Michael from California: 
I believe a majority of families do not realize the government is stealing from them because of this marriage penalty and indirectly has created this pressure to have both parents work to get by and pay for their family's future. This indirectly is driving a wedge between families. 
Michael in California. 
I disagree with the first portion of it, where I think the families do know about this, but in the last portion of it he is saying, `This indirectly is driving a wedge between families.' 
I think anybody here on this floor, if you ask people about this particular bill, `Do we want to drive a wedge between families?' There would be 100 Senators here saying `No, we don't want to drive a wedge between families.' 
That being the case, then why aren't we doing something at this point in time when we have a chance to deal with this particular issue? 
Mr. President, I want to cite some of the studies in case people think we are just citing the people calling in who want a tax cut. 
I have a Joint Economic Committee study, `Reducing Marriage Taxes, Issues and Proposals,' that talks about the various bills that are put forward within the marriage penalty. What we are talking about is putting in income-splitting proposals. They are similar. 
This is the study on page 10, `. . .to optional filing because they adjust for differences in the tax schedules between single and joint filers.' This is the Joint Economic Committee report. 
However, the proposals differ from optional filing because they make no distinction regarding the division of income between spouses. In other words, couples are treated as if each spouse earns half of their total income regardless of which spouse actually generates that income. Income splitting would, therefore, provide all couples with the most favorable tax treatment by effectively treating them like two singles with a 50-50 income split. This favorable treatment would reduce taxes for nearly all married couples. Couples with equal incomes would receive equal tax cuts, thus maintaining horizontal equity. 
Moreover, income splitting would create marriage bonuses for most couples and increase bonuses for couples already receiving them, including one-earner couples. Thus, the proposals reduce marriage neutrality by [they are saying] heavily favoring marriage. 
This is in the study they are putting forward. They are saying, `OK, we are going to create a positive situation for some and we are going to do away with disparity for others.' 
I say, Mr. President, this is a good thing. This is the sort of thing that we ought to do in doing away with this marriage penalty, and this is according to the Joint Economic Committee study that we have. 
I showed you the chart earlier about the differences between marriage penalty and bonuses. What we are trying to get at is this zone of people making between $20,000 and $75,000 and just do away with the marriage penalty. That is a good thing, and that is the signal we ought to send.

<TEXT>
Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate the question, and I think it is absolutely right on target that we are having a reduction in family creation. If you ask people in this body is that a good thing to have taking place, they would say no. We need to have more families, not less families, and part of the problem with government is we have had to create more and more government doing more and more things because we have fewer and fewer families proportionally doing less and less things. 
If there is anything that we have been about, it is trying to reinstill a sense of family and values and virtues in this culture, and everybody agrees with that. Here you have a direct policy that is hurting creation of families, hurting creation of that foundational unit within a society and culture, that if it is weakened, the Government is weakened; if it is stronger, the Government is going to be stronger, too, because you have that foundational unit. 
You can't create enough police forces or militaries or welfare institutions to take the place of the family. We have had a decline percentagewise in the creation of cohesive family units. This policy contributes to that of having a marriage penalty. The removal of that policy would help in the other direction of creating a family unit together. 
I might note to the Senator from Missouri and to my colleagues, when we were looking at the welfare reform debate, we were very concerned about what has happened to our families and saying, `Are we sending the right signals or wrong signals to family creation?' We decided we were sending the wrong signals and we needed to change them to the right signals. 
Do you know what is taking place? In my State of Kansas, we have a reduction in welfare rolls of 50 percent. I have met with a number of people who are off welfare now who were on welfare. I asked them, `What do you think of the changes we did?' And they said, `Thank goodness you did it. Welfare, to me, was like a drug. I got hooked on it. I got addicted to it, and you said, `If you can work, you have to work, and we are going to let the States decide if we are going to subsidize additional children born out of wedlock.' 
They were thanking me for forcing them to do something that they needed to do. That was a policy signal that we sent from the Government. For many years we said if you don't want to work, you don't have to work; if you can work and you don't want to work, you still don't have to work; if you want to have more children out of wedlock, fine, we will pay you for doing that. 
We said, `No, no, no, if you can work, you need to work.' Here let's support marriage.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you for the question. My guess is--and we ought to probably have an economic study done on this--that for every dollar we help out the families, we probably get $10 in reduction of costs to the government. I don't have that based upon studies, but I do have that based upon personal experience of families reaching out and how much more effective they are with heart and soul and arms that can hug and love instead of a cold government check that really doesn't do anything other than make people hooked to it. We need to support, and we need to encourage that. 
Mr. President, I will continue to have additional people wanting to be added as cosponsors. Senator Lott has asked to be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. Mr. President, these are commonsense issues. They are commonsense results of what we need to have. If we support marriage, if we support the family, we will have less cost to government. This is a good thing. This is something we ought to support. It is something we ought to readily do. It is something that should pass with 100 votes. 
We will shortly have a chance to vote on this particular issue. Whether we get a vote directly on it or we vote on a motion to table, I am asking my colleagues to support us in this effort to do away with the marriage penalty when this comes up. It is not taking the entire surplus of the $520 billion that the CBO is now projecting. It would actually score CBO $151.3 billion. I support walling off Social Security for flow of payments for Social Security. This is a statement of marriage to families. We don't have to pay a Social Security against marriage. We don't have to do this. 
I support what the President has been saying, `Let's keep Social Security to Social Security. Let's create a real trust fund.' We have real problems there. We also have real problems in marriage. We also have real problems with families in this country. We can do this. 
Mr. President, $1.50 of every $5 coming in on the surplus would address this marriage penalty that is a horrific signal we are sending out to the country right now, that we would actually tax marriage more. 
Perhaps this is getting somewhat long with people when they keep hearing from folks. These are the commonsense responses from people across country. 
A gentleman in Texas: 
If we are really interested in putting children first, then why would this country penalize the very situation--marriage--where kids do best? When parents are truly committed to each other through their marriage vows their children's outcomes are enhanced. 
And that is Gary from Houston, TX. 
This one I could not believe. This lady is from Virginia. 
I am a 61-year-old grandmother still holding down a full-time job, and I remarried 3 years ago. 
A 61-year-old grandmother, full-time job, remarried 3 years ago. 
I had to think long and hard about marriage over staying single as I knew it would cost us several thousand dollars a year just to sign the marriage license. Marriage has become a contract between two individuals and the Federal Government. 
This one is from Pennsylvania: 
My wife and I have actually discussed the possibility of obtaining a divorce, something neither of us wants or believes in, especially myself. 
He said he was the product of a marriage that has difficulty, but they were considering divorce. He says `simply because my family cannot afford to pay the price.' 
This is Jeffrey from Pennsylvania who says that. 
This gentleman from Illinois says: 
You try and be honest and do things straight, and you get penalized for it. That's just not right. 
That is Mike from Illinois who sent that letter in. 
Person after person coming in and writing in saying that, `Look, this just isn't right.' 
This one from Sarah that was published in the Ottawa Daily Times: 
The marriage penalty is essentially a tax on working wives because the joint filing system compels married couples to identify a primary earner and a secondary earner, and usually the wife falls into the latter category. Therefore, from accountants' point of view, the wife's first dollar of income is taxed at the point where her husband's income has left her. If the husband is making substantially more money than the wife, the couple may even conclude it is not worth it for the wife to earn income. In fact-- 
And she is quoting from a book by a Professor McCaffrey at the University of Southern California. 
In fact, McCaffrey's book details the plight of one woman who realizes her job was actually losing money for her family-- 
Actually losing money for her family. by her working. 
We are overtaxing the American public now anyway, with people having to pay roughly about 40 percent of their income in taxes, taxes at all levels--Federal, State, and local, with Federal being the highest portion. I think that ought to be lowered. But, clearly, you hear there are cases where they are not only being taxed but we are forcing people with two-wage-earner families to work and one just working for the Government, but even in that case you are even taxing them more, to the point where it isn't even worth working. 
Mr. President, this amendment needs to pass. We need to have this debate. We can afford to do this. We can do this and still set Social Security, payroll taxes, aside; and I am calling on my colleagues to do just that. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate greatly everybody's support of the notion that we should do away with the marriage penalty. It is the appropriate signal, and it is the appropriate thing for us to say to the American public. It is the appropriate sort of tax cut that we can certainly pay for it at the present time. I am particularly appreciative of the leadership's support and Senator Lott's commitment to provide that sort of working relief to American taxpayers. 
I am withdrawing my amendment because the Constitution does not allow tax-cutting legislation to originate in the Senate. This vote, however, sends a strong message to the House that we want to eliminate the marriage penalty. And that is what we hope to be able to get done yet this session of Congress. 
I would like to yield to one of the cosponsors of this amendment, the Senator from Missouri, for comments as well.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to explain to my colleagues what the issue was just about. I appreciate the opportunity, as well, to be able to address the question of motivation. 
Make no mistake about the motivation here. Our motivation is to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. That is pure and simple. That is what we have been saying for the last couple of hours. It is to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. 
We wanted to have this debate at this point in time and juncture because there are less than 30 legislative days until we finish up. Signals that have been coming out haven't been much about tax cuts. They have been mostly about spending. We wanted to send a very clear signal we are for cutting taxes, and in particular, first and foremost, the marriage penalty tax. 
We needed to have some way to be able to have that debate. We spent a lot of time here on the Senate floor--we spent 4 weeks on a tobacco bill. We spent a lot of time on a lot of other issues. We have not spent much time on tax cuts. We are limited on the number of things we can talk about, and the vehicles we can talk about them on. This was one we could, and we decided it is getting to the end of this session, we have to start talking about tax cuts. We have to start talking about families. This is one of the things that we can talk about, the marriage penalty tax. 
Anybody looking at the Constitution can say, `Wait a minute; this has to originate in the House.' And it does. Then there is a blue slip procedure in the House, which exists. We are soon to be going out for the August break, and we wanted to be able to say to our colleagues in the House: There is support for marriage penalty tax elimination. We wanted to get that debate started and moving on forward and to say that to them. That is what this debate was about. That is what the vote was for. That is what our motivation is. If anybody is questioning that, we have been standing here for 2 or 3 hours saying that is what we want to do. 
I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will join us, when it comes back from the House, to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. It is a ridiculous tax. I hope most of them would stand up and vote with us at that point in time. If they want to change their vote this time, maybe we can try it again here later on, to send that stronger signal to the House that the Democrat side supports this as well. That is what we are about and that is what we are trying to get through. 
I think we spent plenty of time debating that and making that point clear. So if there is a question about motivation, that is what it is about. It is eliminating that marriage tax penalty and sending that signal back over to the House. 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding the Hutchinson amendment that is to be offered shortly regarding the Tax Code sunset bill or Tax Code Elimination Act that he has been working on. I have been working with him, along with a number of our other colleagues in the Senate, in considering this particular piece of legislation. 
I congratulate the Senator from Arkansas on his work on pushing forward a sunsetting of the Tax Code and a sunsetting of the burden it places on the American families--not so much of the rates, even though I think those are too high; not so much as the level of taxation, which I think are too high as well; but the burden simply of such an oppressive, intrusive Tax Code. 
I want to share a little bit with my Members here in the Senate about the nature of this Tax Code and some of the things that are happening within this Tax Code. I have a chart here that I think says quite a bit about where our Tax Code has evolved to. Look at the basic foundation. The Declaration of Independence, 1,300 words; the Bible, 773,000 words; the United States Tax Code, 2.8 million words and growing. And growing. That is just too much, too much of a burden. 
I also want to share with my colleagues, this debate has been going on for a little bit of time, so we contacted the IRS and said could we have all of the forms that you send to the average American in asking them to fill out their taxes. We just want to see the forms that the average American gets, and we would like to have all of them. 
It was interesting that the first thing they responded from the IRS headquarters is we don't have all of the forms. They said they couldn't get those, so they did send us about two-thirds of them. I would like to show Members, these are just the forms. This is not the law. These represent the regulations that explain what is taking place with the IRS code. These are just the forms that they send and the instructions that go with those forms. There are a lot of other documents that go along with these, as well. I hope I can get these stacked on the desk and the desk will hold it. 
The burden on the back of this desk is the burden on the back of the public. This is not even all the forms. It represents two-thirds of the forms shipped out by the IRS to the average taxpayer, to businesses, saying these are the sort of things you have to fill out. Not only do you have to fill them out, you have to fill them out correctly. If you don't get them correct, you are subject to fines, penalties, possible imprisonment, from this horrendously complex Tax Code that many people--even with some advising from the Government--don't get the answer right. 
If that doesn't define a burden, I don't know what does. What is even worse is that the Federal Government is not content merely in collecting taxes or making complex taxes. It wants to control behavior, as well. Some of those things it would put in the Tax Code are not even very good, either. 
I want to give a great example of micromanagement by the Federal Government of people's daily lives in a negative fashion; that is, the marriage tax penalty. Most people are familiar with the marriage tax penalty, and that is a tax on people to be married, two-wage-earner families, to be married. They will pay more in taxes than two single people. Two single people who choose to live together would pay less in taxes than a married couple. 
Now I think most people would say in this time of difficulty for families that that is a bad signal to send. We are going to tax marriage as a disincentive to marriage in the system. People say we didn't put it there as a disincentive. Well, it is a disincentive to marriage and it is built into the Tax Code and it is substantial. It is also preposterous. 
Our society is built on the foundation of solid families. Creating disincentives to solid families is the wrong signal for us to send at this point in time in our Republic. It is the wrong signal to send at any time. Because of the marriage penalty and other inconsistencies in our Tax Code, I am convinced that this is a Tax Code that history will report as one of the most onerous burdens ever faced by the American public. Our amendment aims to make this code history and to require Congress and the President to put in place a new code, a fair and a simpler tax code, that has far less micromanagement from the Federal Government, and is far more oriented towards growth and toward the family. 
Mr. President, I want another American century. I want it for my children. I want it for my children's children. And I want it for all Americans. I am convinced that with this type of a system, with this type of micromanagement out of Washington, we cannot have another American century. This code must be scrapped. We put plenty of time in place to come up with a new, better, simpler tax code that is more liberating to the families, that is more supportive to business, and is far more intelligible by the public. 
As a matter of fact, I simply ask my colleagues that don't support this type of amendment, could we do any worse than the current Tax Code? Could we truly be any more complicated than the current taxation system? Could we be any more onerous and unintelligible than the current tax system if we sunset this and go to another? I ask that question as I travel around the State of Kansas, and I don't get many people that say it could get any worse. It has grown over the years and we have added and added and amended and amended. Americans are demanding tax reform and we have promised tax reform. It is now time to deliver on that promise to the American people. Some will argue that we have to be careful about any radical changes to our tax laws, 
and I agree. I believe that we must carefully weigh alternative plans, debate the macro and micro effects of each, and then arrive at a thoughtful and reasoned solution that is equitable and just. That is why we are putting this off 4 1/2 years until we actually go to and require a new Tax Code. We are saying 4 1/2 years of debate, but let's finally start the debate. We haven't even gotten started on it. We are saying let's start the debate, and let's set a time certain that we will have a new Tax Code that is fairer and simpler, and let's have a great national debate about it. The way we are going right now is, we are saying yes, it is a bad Tax Code, but we are not willing to do anything about it. 
This amendment would simply say we are going to do something about this over the next 4 1/2 years. We are going to pass a new Tax Code. We are sunsetting this one at a date certain, and let the great national debate begin. I think that is a just and equitable way to go, and it is not a radical way to go. 
The bottom line is that the Tax Code we now have in place punishes good investment decisions and distorts the labor market, as well as our rates of national savings. It hurts the family and manipulates behavior by adding incentive to do one thing while punishing another, which frequently goes in the wrong direction. 
Here is another quick example of an inadequacy in our Tax Code that is a harmful public signal. I don't know if you recall this; some people will. I mentioned this previously on the floor. If you are a chronic gambler, you can deduct your gambling losses. If you are a homeowner who made an unlikely investment and the value of your home declined, you have no recourse in the Tax Code because you cannot claim a deduction for capital loss. The question is, Why can somebody deduct a loss associated with a bad game of blackjack but not a loss associated with their primary residence in which they were the unfortunate victim rather than the willing participant? The code is full of inconsistencies like the one I mentioned--perhaps unintended--that people got into over a period of time. 
I would like to think that what we could do now is start a reasoned and great debate about a simpler, fairer, better system that is far less about micromanagement and raising revenue for the Federal Government, and not about sending bad signals to the public. Some may disagree about how we would go about going to a different Tax Code, but this is precisely the issue upon which we must focus our debate. We must decide where we want the tax to be imposed, and we must understand the imposition of the tax on the health of the economy. However this debate takes shape, we must have as our goal a tax system that doesn't distort behavior and create deadweight loss. We must have as our goal a pro-growth, pro-family tax system. We should have as our model some kind of simpler and fairer and far more understandable code. 
As I travel across Kansas, I ask a lot of people about whether or not they regularly, or even within the last month, have made a personal or business decision based upon the Tax Code. Virtually two-thirds say that, `Over the last month, I have made a business or a family decision based upon tax policy.' That is not what we want to create. It is a system where everybody has to consult with the Tax Code before they make a business decision, where everybody has to consult the Tax Code before they make a family decision. Yet, that is the system that evolved to where we are today, to where it is micromanagement out of Washington. 
I ask the public in Kansas, `Imagine if you had a system that, regardless of the business decision you made or the family decision you made, the tax results were the same. Would you like such a system?' They say, `Absolutely.' Furthermore, they would have more economic growth, as they would put the money into a better economic decision taking place here, and they would not be penalized as a family member doing things that are the best for their families. 
Let's begin the great national debate. Let's sunset this Tax Code and move to something new. Our bill will enable the debate to take place outside of the realm of some of the demagoguery because it does protect the important funding mechanisms for Social Security and Medicare. We set aside those chapters in the IRS Code; we don't touch those. I believe we have a commitment to ensure that we have a full, honest, and open debate. Our bill will give that opportunity to this Senate. 
Finally, Mr. President, as we look forward to the new millennium and, hopefully, another American century, we will provide the American people with a renewed sense of the American dream, a renewed sense of what it means to be an American and what it means to live in America. We can't achieve that with this taxation system. It is time to sunset it, start the debate, and get to a better one. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment that would provide rural States with a stronger representation on the Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service (Joint Board). 
Such a change is necessary because critical universal telephone service issues have been mishandled by the Joint Board since the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
The Joint Board was intended to provide the States with an opportunity to help craft national universal service policy because the States are more experienced in dealing with these issues than their national counterparts. 
The Act created the Joint Board and required the Board to make recommendations concerning how the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) should implement the universal service provisions contained in the Act. 
However, the Joint Board was chaired by former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, and the Board made recommendations that undermine rural interests and put upward pressure on rural residential telephone rates. 
The Joint Board needs greater representation from the States, especially rural States. My amendment would do the following: 
Add an additional State Utility Commissioner to the Joint Board. 
Require that two of the five State Utility Commissioners serving on the Board represent rural States. 
Require that one of the State Commissioners and one of the FCC Commissioners serve as Co-Chairmen of the Joint Board. 
Mr. President, this amendment would ensure that rural interests are adequately represented on the Joint Board, and that the recommendations made to the FCC are consistent with the universal service goals of the Act. 
Mr. President, I have been very frustrated with the manner in which universal service issues have been addressed by the Joint Board and the FCC since the passage of the Act. Although it is the most important part of universal service, the high-cost piece has been getting the short shrift. 
The FCC has just referred a number of critical high-cost issues back to the Joint Board for its consideration. This amendment is critical because rural communities across the country need to be effectively represented on the Board as it reviews these issues. The States, especially rural States, have the most experience dealing with the high-cost issues, and the recommendations of the Joint Board must adequately reflect their input and their expertise.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Last week when we put forward this notion of doing away with the marriage penalty, one of my Democrat colleagues said, `I would be willing to do that if you offset it by doing away with the marriage bonus.' He raised the question of the marriage bonus in the Tax Code. I told him I am not about raising taxes. But I wonder if the Senator has thought about this issue. Is there a marriage bonus that is in the Tax Code? Is that something that should be addressed?

Mr. BROWNBACK. If my colleague will yield for another question, it seems the bonus is to America; it is not necessarily to the married couple that we are talking about in this. 
The other thing I would ask my colleague about is, the 
marriage penalty that we are talking about affects nearly 21 million American families, most of them young, starting families. These are all families that make between $20,000 and $70,000 a year. They are two-wage-earner families. So you are really talking about that group of young Americans just getting started, both working, both struggling, both trying to make this family go, and we actually penalize them on an average of $1,400 per year. My colleague is familiar with that. Also, this is a relatively new tax. We have only put it on since 1969. That was the year of Woodstock. I don't know if there is a significance to any of that, but perhaps this is now the time that we should get away from that sort of penalty. 
I just was curious; I know my colleague knows of those statistics and the importance of trying to help those struggling young families that are just now getting a foundation started for their families.

Mr. BROWNBACK. If my colleague will yield, I would also note the individuals who have contacted various offices around here signing on to this very issue. This is a lady from Indiana who said this: 
I can't tell you how disgusted we both are over this tax issue. If we get married, not only would I forfeit my $900 refund check, we would be writing a check to the IRS for $2,800. Darryl and I would very much like to be married, and I must say it broke our hearts when we found out we can't afford to get married. 
This is from Indiana. 
This gentleman from Ohio said:  
I have been engaged to be married. My fiancee and I have discussed the fact we will be penalized financially. We have postponed the date of our marriage in order to save up and have a running start in part because of this nasty unfair tax structure. 
Those are just two. And I have a number of other letters of people saying: `What is this? You guys are talking about family values and you penalize us for getting married.' And particularly the youngest couples just getting started. 
All we are asking for today is to let us vote on this issue, and we are being blocked. I am asking people not to vote for this cloture motion, in order that we can vote to do away with this extraordinarily bad tax that is taxing those fundamental family-building units, the marriage institution that we need so much to be so much stronger.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to explain to Members what is taking place here. Yesterday I filed an amendment to the legislative appropriations bill that would eliminate the marriage penalty we have been talking about this morning. My amendment, which is being cosponsored by several Senators, would reinstate income splitting and provide married couples who currently labor under this Tax Code with some relief. I tried to offer my amendment last Friday with spending legislation that was originally supposed to be debated. However, because of objections from the Democrat side of the aisle to the unanimous consent request that would have guaranteed a vote on eliminating the marriage penalty, we have not been able to get a vote on the elimination of the marriage penalty. 
Later in the day, another UC was propounded that would have allowed the Senate to move forward with the legislative branch appropriations bill but without my amendment, and to that UC I objected. Subsequently, the cloture motion was filed to bring debate about tax relief to a close and move forward with this legislation. 
I am asking my colleagues today to vote against this cloture motion so we can consider the marriage penalty that is being objected to by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Thomas and I have offered would simply require the Architect of the Capitol, the Secretary of the Senate, the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, the Public Printer, and the Director of the United States Botanic Garden to submit to Congress an inventory of all noninherently governmental--or commercial--activities. 
Throughout this session of Congress, my colleague from Wyoming and I have been working on S. 314, also known as the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act, which would require the Federal agencies to do the same. My subcommittee, the Oversight Subcommittee on Government Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia has held three hearings focusing on this legislation. More recently, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee reported this bill out of committee. This bill has bipartisan support, the support of the Administration, as well as Federal employees and the industry community. 
Through our work on this issue, we concluded that this requirement should apply to the legislative branch as well. Last month, OMB asked all Federal agencies to submit their commercial inventory to OMB. The legislative branch should do the same and submit their inventory to Congress. 
The Thomas-Brownback amendment tasks those who are engaged in the daily operations of the legislative branch to identify these commercial activities. Once these activities are identified, the heads of these legislative branch departments, along with the Senators, will have the opportunity to evaluate these functions. 
Past discussions concerning these activities in the legislative branch have focused only on specific targets such as the Senate Barber Shop and Beauty Salon. In order to have a comprehensive view of how to improve operations in the legislative branch, we need to know all commercial activities performed in-house. 
As the legislative body of the Federal Government, we, as Congress have the opportunity to not only legislate on this issue, but to set an example. I challenge my colleagues who are committed to ensuring that no taxpayer's dollar is wasted in the Federal Government, to set this example and support this amendment.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the Senator from Utah taking the time to explain what we are hoping to go to next, the legislative branch appropriations bill. I hope we can discuss as a part of that legislative branch appropriations bill something that affects 21 million American families and it increases their taxes an average of $1,400 per family. It was done to them in 1969, the last year that we balanced the budget, until this year, and we have the ability to deal with it now. That is a thing called the marriage penalty, the marriage penalty tax. 
I don't know how much of the American public is aware of this tax, but in 1969, there was placed a tax, actually a change in the Tax Code to a point that married couples were taxed more for being married than if they were single. It amounts, on average, to $1,400 per family. It affects around 21 million American families, and it is wrong. 
It is the wrong kind of tax. It is the wrong kind of notion. It is telling people, in the Tax Code, that we are going to penalize you for being married. This is a wrong idea when we are struggling so much in America today with the maintenance of families, with trying to keep families together, when we are trying to say that the foundational units of a civil society is the American family, and then we are saying, `Well, yeah, but we're going to tax you.' We send by that signal that we think less of married families. 
It is time that we go back and do what we did prior to 1969, and that is not tax married couples more than if they were just single people living together. We were, up until 1969, operating that way, and then in that year, in an attempt to get more revenues into the Federal Government, we put this tax in place, taxing married couples. It is wrong. It is the wrong idea. It is the wrong signal. 
It is something that we have the ability to deal with now. The Congressional Budget Office this week stated that over the next 5 years, we will have $520 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years--$520 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years, a half a trillion dollars. I just say to my colleagues, my goodness, if we have that resource there, we have families struggling so much, if the foundational unit of a civil society is the family and we are taxing that family more, let's give them a little break. 
This is the right vehicle on which to do it. We are talking about funding the legislative shop here, let's help fund the families a little bit. We have the ability to do it, and it will send the right signal. It will send a good signal. It is the time we can send a signal, and we ought to do it, and we ought to do it now. 
That is what we were hoping to propose on the legislative branch appropriations bill, to deal with the elimination of the marriage tax penalty for the working families. This hits mostly families between a combined income of $20,000 per year to $75,000 per year. That is the category of families that is hit by this marriage tax penalty. 
The amendment that I was going to propose and was sponsored by Senator Ashcroft and a number of others--Senator Inhofe, Senator Smith, and I think a lot of my colleagues would join on this amendment--the amendment I was going to put forward does a very simple thing: It just makes the standard deduction the same for married couples as it is for singles. 
I don't know how many people recognize this, but currently, if you file single, under the Tax Code, the standard deduction is $4,150, while the marriage standard deduction is only $6,900. Our amendment would simply raise the standard deduction for all married couples to $8,300, precisely double what it currently is for single people, so you don't have this penalty built into the 
system, so you don't have this signal to the American public that we devalue this institution of marriage. In 1969, and prior to that period of time, we said you get the same if you are married, and then after 1969, we said you don't. 
I guess there were a number of reasons this was put into effect in 1969. People were saying, `Well, if you are single versus if you are a couple, you have living expenses that are a little less.' If there are two singles versus two people living together in the same place--there are a number, I suppose, of different reasons, but I guess actually at the end of the day, the reason was to get more tax money out of people's pockets. It was done then, and now we are saying let's correct this wrong. 
When you ask the American public about this issue--and I raise it quite a bit with people--they think this is a ridiculous tax. We shouldn't be taxing couples more than we tax singles who live together. It just sends a signal that this is not the sort of thing we want to take place today, particularly when you look at what happens to our families across America. 
I don't think I need to remind many people about the problems we are having with marriage and with families in this country today. We are having at any one time nearly 50 percent of our children living in a single-headed household, and many of these families struggling heroically to raise a family, but yet we are sending a signal against the family at the same time we do that. 
We are also sending it to some of the hardest hit families who struggle the most in the economy today. This tax applies heaviest to families with incomes of between $20,000 a year and $75,000 a year. This is a good bracket of folks we are taxing more heavily, and we shouldn't be taxing them more heavily at this point in time. 
I direct my colleagues' attention to some of the reports that have been put out on this issue as well. The Congressional Budget Office did a report about a year ago on this particular issue. They state in their report: 
Federal income tax laws generally require that a married couple file a joint tax return based on the combined income of the husband and wife. As a result, husbands and wives with similar incomes usually incur a larger combined tax liability than they would if they could file individually. 
This is the opening statement of the CBO. 
I ask all of my colleagues, How many of you agree with that tax policy? That is something that the Congress put in place. How many people actually agree with that tax policy? I don't know that there would be anybody who would actually agree with that tax policy, yet it is in place and we have the time, we have the wherewithal, we have the vehicle here funding the legislative branch that we can do this and fund this now. I think it is appropriate that we should do that and take care of something that in 1969--relatively recently--was put in place. 
I draw my colleagues' attention to some editorials that have been written on this particular subject. The Indianapolis Star talks about the marriage penalty and that this is something from which we should get away. They have even a pretty nice cartoon about a couple and a car who are just married, and they are hooked to this big anchor, a marriage tax penalty, pulling them back the other way. 
Is that the sort of signal we want to send from Congress toward the institution of marriage? I don't think it is. 
The Christian Science Monitor: `Bid to Make Tax Policy Friendlier to Marriage.' They are saying, `Look, this is something we ought to do.' 
We have a number of editorials where this was raised across the country. 
We are just dealing with one aspect of this. In fact, according to the Joint Economic Committee, in a study on the marriage penalty, the Tax Code contains 66 provisions that can affect a married couple's tax liability. So it is a number of places. We are just getting at one particular feature of it which is that standard deduction. I think there are places we ought to look at overall in doing more in this area. That is the sort of thing that we want to take up--this ridiculous tax--that we want to put forward. 
I am hopeful that, with the manager of the bill who has been agreeable to this, we can get the Democrat ranking member to agree that we could bring up this ridiculous tax, and that he would consent to us having a debate, a vote on this particular issue, so we can say to the American public, this is something that is pretty important, and we can do this now, particularly since the CBO said we have the wherewithal to get this done. 
So I plead with my Democrat colleagues, let us bring this up. A marriage tax penalty is something important----

I think that is not the way we ought to be going, particularly with the kind of money that we have flowing into the Treasury, and particularly with the American public being taxed at roughly 40 percent of their income annually. They are taxed to the max. And then we add on top of that--to working families--the marriage penalty. The tax repeal I am talking about applies to families that make a combined income between $20,000 a year and $75,000 a year. And that is the one that I want to pull off. And I hope that----

Mr. BROWNBACK. It is strange, but actually if you look at our tax policy, people would be paid to be able to--if they do get a divorce and live separately, they would actually have more money coming to them and less going to the Federal Treasury, which is an extraordinary, ridiculous notion that is built into 
the Tax Code.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I appreciate the question the Senator is asking. I am told also there is a married couple, they are economists at one of the universities in the country, who each year divorce at the end of the year and get married the next day. Then they have kind of a party with the money that they earned and keep by going through this process of divorcing on December 30, or 31 and marrying again on January 1st or 2nd. They have kind of a honeymoon each year off of this signal that they are able to read from the Federal Government. And the thing about it, I do not want to suggest that more people do that. I think that would be a wrong notion. But still it is----

Mr. BROWNBACK. Absolutely. I could not agree more with the notion that there are things that ought to be taken into consideration here. And the notion of a bonus in marriages is not an accurate notion here. I was willing to let my colleague from Kentucky go ahead and raise his amendment on this particular bill, if he would desire to, if he would let us be able to put this amendment forward and have a discussion, if he wants to try to refute that sort of argument taking place. But I do not think that we should be in the business, even if there is such a thing as a bonus, of removing that on married couples.

Mr. BROWNBACK. In order to be able to eliminate the marriage penalty, there are different ways people have configured and looked at this issue. The bill we are putting forward has a $151 billion price tag over 5 years. So you are not even talking about dealing with the entire surplus with this marriage tax penalty.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Less than one-third. 
Out of every $5 surplus you have, $1.50 is going back to married families. Does that make any rational sense here, that we are getting $5 in and saying, OK, $1.50 is back. I think we ought to be doing far more. This ought to start the overall situation, but we are looking at least a start here. 
This is the sort of thing we need to do. We need to move. You ought to see the groups supporting this. The National Taxpayers Union, with 300,000 members, strongly supports the Marriage Tax Elimination Act. The Marriage Tax Elimination Act would address that and dramatically widen the scope of tax relief. 
This is a broad tax relief issue--21 million families, not just individuals, 21 million families, in America pay this tax penalty. Currently, laws force many married Americans to pay a higher tax bill than they would if they remained single and had the same combined income. Such a double standard is wholly at odds with the American ideal that taxes should not be a primary consideration in any individual's economic or social choices. I want to underline `social choices' because we have social problems in this country. We have social maladies in this country. 
I held a forum with Joe Lieberman last week about the overall issue of violence and teen violence taking place, and everyone there----

Mr. BROWNBACK. From the left, from the right--I want to go ahead and finish this point, if I could--from the left and from the right. We had a former Black Panther there, a former Clinton administration official saying the real problem we have here is we have a breakdown in the families taking place. We have too little density of responsible adults per children. We are saying send a signal that does not decrease the density of adults per child. I think that is a responsible social policy instead of a social choice here that is actually contrary to the issue. 
Americans for Tax Reform support the Marriage Tax Elimination Act, offered in the House by Representatives Weller! and McIntosh. `We believe that married working couples deserve the same treatment as singles.' That is their statement. 
Now, isn't that pretty clear? Now is the perfect time for action because the Congressional Budget Office is anticipating an earlier-than-expected fiscal surplus. This is Americans for Tax Reform saying that this is a good way to go. For many Americans, the average marriage tax is approximately equal in value to half a year of car payments. Half a year of car payments we are talking about. With an extra $1,400 a year, a couple might be able to send a child to the school of their choice. The bottom line is, according to the Americans for Tax Reform, a marriage tax is very real to many working couples in this country. 
I ask people who are watching this, if you would look and figure up your own tax and see how many of you are paying a marriage tax penalty for being married.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator. As I understand it, negotiations are going on now as to whether or not we will be able to bring up this particular elimination of the marriage tax penalty. We are trying to get agreement with your side of the aisle on whether or not that would be allowed to be brought up in the legislative branch appropriations bill. That is my desire. If we get that worked out, I will be yielding rapidly so that you can go forward with your items. If that is not getting worked out, I am going to talk about this for awhile, because it is an important issue. 
The Legislative Calendar is short. We have spent a lot of time talking about the tobacco settlement--a month. We have spent a lot of time talking about things that don't as directly affect the American family as the marriage tax penalty does, on 21 million American families. So I think it is time that we start talking about something that gets to North Dakota families and others directly. That is why I am willing to do this and to tie things up until we get moving forward on some of that.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I was proceeding earlier, before allowing the Senator from Nevada to speak before catching a plane. 
A number of groups have taken notice of this issue of a marriage tax penalty and think that it is clearly time and it is important that we at this time address this particular issue. 
The Independent Women's Forum has sent a letter urging Congress to `put the Tax Code where its rhetoric is.' 
I think that is a real interesting way they state that in the letter. `We should put the Tax Code where the Congress' rhetoric is.' We talk a lot about families, values, and virtues, and those sorts of institutions that make for a civil society. We talk endlessly about those things. Yet, then we tax them; we tax them disproportionately. This group has the courage to be able to identify, well, I guess then you guys really don't mean it. You will say one thing and do another. 
The Independent Women's Forum urges Congress to put the Tax Code where its rhetoric is and eliminate marriage penalties. Serious steps to reform tax laws would mean real liberation to those who work and those who may have to in the future. Marriage taxes can impose a nearly 50-percent marginal tax rate on second earners. 
They are saying in their publication, most of which are spouses, obviously, this is a State-sponsored discrimination, the unintended consequence of which is to discourage--they are saying here--women from entering the labor force. 
`If Congress is sincere in improving the lives of American families, it will eliminate tax loopholes that choke paychecks. Real support for the family begins with tax reform.' 
There is a strong letter that they are citing that we ought to change our Tax Code along that line. 
Let's look at the Catholic Alliance, and what they say. 
The Catholic Alliance Endorses the Marriage Tax Elimination Act. 
Their president announces support for the Marriage Tax Elimination Act and the end of the marriage tax penalty. They say this: 
Catholic Alliance promotes the primacy of the family as a matter of public policy. We support the Marriage Tax Elimination Act as one step in the right direction. The current tax code, while it still exists, should be used as a vehicle to promote social responsibility. It certainly should not be used in a punitive manner toward the preeminent institution of marriage and family. 
How better could you describe it than that? `It certainly should not be used in a punitive manner toward the preeminent institution of marriage and family.' 
They go on to state: 
We welcome the Marriage Tax Elimination Act introduced today by representatives Dave McIntosh and Jerry Weller. This bill can be a first step in recognizing in law that the family is the first church, the first school, the first government, the first hospital, the first economy, and the first and most vital mediating institution in our culture. In order to encourage stable two-parent marriage bound households we can no longer support a tax code that penalizes them,' Fournier said. 
Then this is what Pope John Paul II said in a letter in a publication called `Christian Family in the Modern World.' The Pope says this: 
. . . families should grow in awareness of being `protagonists' of what is known as `family politics' and assume responsibility for transforming society; otherwise families will be the first victims of the evils that they have done no more than note with indifference. 
There are some pretty strong terms that they noted.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his statement. I do want to note what is going on here. The leadership on our side is attempting to get the legislative branch bill to the floor for debate. That is appropriate and that is as it should be. I am simply saying, before we give the legislature its money, let's give some American families their money back in a small tax cut. Actually, I think we could do far better than this, but a tax cut that they should have. The leadership, Trent Lott, agrees with me on this and is willing to do that. 
We have an objection from the other side of the aisle. The Democrat side of the aisle is not willing to let us take this bill up at this time. 
The majority leader is in agreement and wants to do this, wants to have a vote on this particular bill. We cannot get agreement from our Democrat colleagues to agree to vote on this bill. The irony of that is, I think, if we were able to get it up for a vote, there would be a number of my Democrat colleagues who would agree that we should do away with the marriage tax penalty. This is a ridiculous notion, way out of step with all of our rhetoric, way out of step with the rhetoric of everybody running for public office in America, talking about the need to support family and family values. 
We tax families more than we do people who are not in a family situation--not that we should penalize those either, but this should just all be level. Many of my colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle, I am convinced, would vote for this. But we are being blocked by my Democrat colleagues from being able to take this up for a vote on a legislative branch bill, and I am just not willing to concede that we should not vote on this issue at this point in time when we are running budget surpluses--that we should just say, OK, we will fund the legislature, we will fund all the operations of these fine institutions, but we are going to keep taking more money from married couples who make between $25,000 and $75,000 a year. We are going to penalize them $1,400 a year, on average, while the legislature gets their money and while the Democrat side of the aisle objects to this being voted on. 
I do not think that is right. I do not think we ought to do that, particularly in light of what we know our financial situation to be. We can do this. It should be done. We used to do it. We used to treat married couples the same as single filers up until 1969. We treated them the same at that point in time. Then, at that point in time, we created the imbalance situation, to where married couples are taxed more. 
I do not know how many people recognize just how this works, because it is not even all married couples who are taxed more. The National Center for Policy Analysis, in a February 1998 policy background paper, puts it this way. They say:  
A marriage penalty results when a married couple pays more for taxes by filing jointly than each could be if each filed as a single person. 
That was the feature we talked about earlier--some economists--a man and a woman, economists, who each year at the end of the year divorce, file separately, retain the extra money, have kind of a special party, honeymoon, and then marry again the first of the year. That is just each year they do this to take advantage of this situation, which is ridiculous, that the Tax Code would actually encourage that. 
A couple files the marriage penalty only [only] when both spouses have earned income. 
Is that fair, that we only do this when both spouses have earned income? A large percentage of married couples, where both spouses work, work because they have to; they have to, to make ends meet, when you have a national effective tax rate--national, State, local--of 40 percent, and you have one spouse work to pay taxes and the other spouse work to pay for everything else. So we have, in this country, again because of tax policy, in many respects--we force both couples to work, whether or not they really want to, in their family arrangement. That is their choice of what they decide to do. 
But this marriage tax penalty then, to add insult to injury again, only applies when both spouses have earned income--only when both of them are working. Does that make any sense for a tax policy in America? Does that make any sense for struggling families at all? I think my Democrat colleagues ought to want to vote on that sort of issue. 
Single earner couples never pay a penalty; in fact, always get a bonus from the Tax Code. 
Single earner couples never pay a penalty; in fact, always get a bonus from the Tax Code, paying less taxes than they would pay as singles. 
This is single-earner couples. Is that good tax policy either? Is that the way we should be? I think my Democrat colleagues would want to vote on an issue like this. We are talking about returning a portion and not spending more in deficit and not hurting Social Security reform or saving Social Security. We can still save Social Security. You don't have to pick between marriage and Social Security on this. CBO says we will have $520 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years. We can help pay down the debt, we can support marriage, and stop this ridiculous tax on marriage, and we can save Social Security. Those are doable in the current situation we are in. Why on Earth would we not want to vote? Why on Earth would my Democrat colleagues be blocking us from voting on this particular issue that is so important? 
And, finally, we can help match our rhetoric to our actions on how important family values are. We need to do those things. They show, in this National Center for Policy Analysis backgrounder piece, just how this issue works. 
The marriage penalty fundamentally results . . . [and they have charts in here] `Percentages of couples with marriage penalties and bonuses.' 
I note it only applies to two-wage-earner families that you get the marriage penalty, which I think is wrong. But what happens is, when you hit into this penalty category, this is when you have two-wage-earner families making between approximately $20,000 a year and $75,000 a year, hit this penalty category, this tax increase category. 
Think about that. How many people in America would be impacted then by that? We are talking about two-wage-earner families making combined between $20,000 and $75,000 a year. That is a lot of people. It is an estimate that is affecting 21 million American families. That is just the two-wage earners. It is not the other children associated with the families who are getting this huge tax hit that on average is $1,400. 
Maybe some people don't think $1,400 is very much money. It is a half-a-year car payment for some people. It is a wrong signal to everybody. Whether you agree or disagree that this is very much or very little, it is the wrong signal to send at this time of such struggle that we are having taking place in America. It just hits that category of people.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the point. I still fundamentally disagree with it. If we are talking about the issue of fairness, we spent 4 weeks talking about raising taxes on tobacco and working Americans. I don't know how many people were arguing at that time, `OK, if we spent 4 weeks on that then we ought to talk 4 weeks about tax cuts.' 
I have only been standing here an hour or two. We spent 4 weeks talking about raising those taxes, vote after vote. Some of the things in that policy area I thought were making some legitimate points about how we should try to cut back on teen smoking--which I do not support; nobody supports teen smoking--and how we can get at it. If we are going to talk about fundamental fairness, we did spend 4 weeks on that particular topic and much of it centered around how we raise taxes. 
I am talking about on this particular bill, because we are short on the Legislative Calendar, let's talk about a tax cut. We are not getting a vote on that. We are being blocked from getting a vote on a very serious tax policy problem at a very important time in our country. 
There was a poll of the American public about what they are most concerned about today. Consistently, people have been getting more and more concerned about what is happening to the values of this country, what is happening to us. While I don't think this body at all can control that sort of, `Hey, here's what's happening across a civil society in America,' we can send signals, and we do send signals regularly. 
When we had the welfare reform bill, we said in the welfare reform bill, `OK, if you're an able-bodied person and you can work, after 2 years, you are going to have to work. If you can do that, we are going to make you do that.' We sent a signal from here. 
Do you know what is happening in Kansas because of that? We have a welfare roll reduction of nearly 50 percent. I met with a number of people who were on welfare for a long period of time. They said to me, `This is a wonderful change. You forced me off it. Welfare was like a drug that I was hooked to. You made me get out and work, and I feel better about it.' 
A 50-percent reduction, and the people who were on it feel better about where they are today. It was a signal. One can say, `Well, we didn't really change that much of welfare reform policy.' I think we did change a substantial amount, and we sent the right signal. 
With this, Mr. President, we are sending all the wrong signals. We are saying that if you are a two-wage-earner family, you have to pay more in taxes. If you make between $20,000 and $75,000, I am sorry, you have to pay more in taxes. It is the wrong signal. It sends a bad signal. It needs to be corrected, and it can be corrected. 
We are on the legislative branch appropriations bill. As the Senator from Utah had noted, this does not include the salaries of individuals who serve in this body, and I misstated that. These are some of the things that it does fund: It funds the operations of Congress. People can see the Superintendent's shops, the various things we fund here, and directory of services we have here. 
The only reason I am pointing this out is that this is basically running this institution, some of which I am wondering why we don't have contracted out or privatized myself. My point in raising this is, I think before we pay these, we ought to give more back to families to operate their budget, a mere $1,400. 
I talked some about the groups who support this elimination of the marriage tax penalty. I noted, too, I hope my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, when we get a chance to vote on this, will be supportive of this. 
I think it is important that people understand how this problem works and when it went in place and what we can do about it. 
I have cited the Congressional Budget Office before on this particular problem where they are noting: 
The Federal income tax law generally requires married couples filing a joint tax return based on combined income of husband and wife. As a result, husbands and wives with similar incomes usually incur a larger combined tax liability than they would if they could file individually. At the same time, spouses who have markedly different incomes but file as a couple generally face smaller tax bills than they would if they were single. 
Is that good tax policy? Is that right? 
Those two possibilities often referred to as `marriage penalties' and `bonuses' result from the conflicting goals of a tax system that attempts to balance fairness between married and unmarried couples among married couples and among taxpayers with differing incomes. 
OK. So we have had a conscious policy here toward marriage for some period of time. My problem is, why do we penalize a certain group in here, that is, middle-income individuals, struggling greatly in this system, and we actually have this as a policy? This is according to CBO. This is a policy, and we enacted it into law in Congress in 1969--before I was here, the year of Woodstock, the year of putting a man on the Moon. I do not know if there was a signal that was sent at Woodstock that we ought to do these sorts of things, but it went into place then. 
Under the 1996 tax law, married couples could face a Federal tax bill that was more than $20,000 higher than the amounts they would pay if they were not married and could file individual tax returns, whereas, other couples may find that filing a joint tax return reduces their tax bills by more than $4,000. 
Now, surely my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would want to redress this issue. And I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota saying, `Well, we're not opposed to it. We just want to raise a whole bunch of other tax bills.' What we are trying to do with this is to direct and correct the very narrow wrong that applies to 21 million American families. 
I would hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would say that is not something we need trading material for, that `We will trade you that if you will let us bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights,' or some other issue. Or as the Senator from Kentucky said, he wanted to do away with the marriage bonus, which I have a problem with. I do not want to raise those taxes on individuals. I do not think that most people on the other side of the aisle would say we need to trade this back and forth. 
Why couldn't we just get a consent from them that we would vote on this amendment? Yet, that is the problem I am having, not being able to get consent from Democrat colleagues on this particular issue that we would be able to get a vote on this item. 
I am willing to have a vote on Senator Ford's proposal that we do away with the marriage bonus, which I do not agree with. I will not vote with the Senator, but I certainly am willing to agree that we have a vote on that particular issue. But I do not see why we would disagree. I do not see why we would have this particular problem at this particular time and in this debate. 
Let me cite some other materials that people are working with about the particular problems that families are having. 
CBO again:  
The various ways of defining marriage penalties and bonuses--one broad measure indicates that more than 21 million married couples-- 
Twenty-one million married couples; so there are families associated with those married couples-- paid an average of nearly $1,400 in additional taxes in 1996 alone-- 
So $1,400 per couple-- because they must file jointly, whereas, another 25 million found that the benefits of filing jointly decrease their tax bill an average of $1,300. 
I am glad that people got the decrease on the 25 million. I see no reason why we should penalize the other 21 million. 
Marriage penalties totaled about $29 billion in 1996. 
The marriage penalty--listen to this--$29 billion was the size of the marriage penalty in 1996. So $29 billion. That is a negative signal of gigantic proportion that we are sending across this Republic and across this country, if we do not deal with this issue. And it is of importance that we deal with it now while we have so few legislative days that remain. 
I want to quote some people, what working Americans are saying about the marriage penalty as they grow more and more informed about the marriage penalty. 
This is a gentleman from Union, KY. He said this: 
Before we set a wedding date, I calculated the tax implications. 
There is a scary notion, that before you get married that a person is going to actually calculate their tax implications to 
it. I hope more people do not do that. 
Since we each earn in the low $30,000s, the federal marriage penalty was over $3,000. 
This is a gentleman in Union, KY. The marriage penalty was over $3,000. 
He notes: 
What a wonderful gift from the IRS! 
What kind of gift is that? What kind of message is that? What kind of signal is that? It is money that ought to be returned. I encourage people listening and watching--why don't you figure out what your own marriage penalty is to see how you are going to be impacted if we are able to get this change and get a vote on it from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if they will let us vote on it? 
This is Bobby and Susan from Marietta, GA, who raised this issue. They said this quote: 
When we figured out our 1996 tax return . . . we figured what our tax would be if we were just living together instead of married. 
Now, that is not a very good notion either that we want to encourage with the tax policy. 
They said this: 
Imagine our disgust when we discovered that, if we just lived together instead of being married, we would have saved an additional $1,000. 
That is the signal we wanted to send to Bobby and Susan from Marietta, GA? 
`Imagine our disgust when we discovered that, if we just lived together instead of being married, we could have saved an additional $1,000.' 
I am standing here thinking, now, is that the signal we wanted to send to them? How many married couples actually figure what their taxes are and say, `You know what? The Federal Government is telling us not to get married. Maybe we should not get married, then, if that is the signal that they are sending to us. And we are going to either pay a penalty of $1,000 for getting married, or we can continue to live together. Now, should we pay that penalty or should we just live together?' 
Bobby and Susan said they figured it was, for them, going to be an additional $1,000 in taxes. 
Listen to this quote: 
So much for the much vaunted `family values' of our government. Our government is sending a very bad message to young adults by penalizing marriage this way. 
Here are people that actually sat and figured it out. And people do figure these things out. And they do see the signals that are being sent, and they do respond. Fortunately, a lot of people know that these are wrong signals, and then they do not act accordingly. But they do respond to those things. 
Here is Sharon from Indiana, what she said. This is a good one. 
I can't tell you how disgusted we both are over this tax issue. If we get married not only would I forfeit my $900 refund check, we would be writing a check to the IRS for $2,800. 
So she forfeits a $900 refund check. And she would be writing a check to the IRS for $2,800. 
Darryl and I would very much like to be married . . . 
`Darryl and I would very much like to be married.' 
and I must say, it broke our hearts when we found out we can't afford it [when they found out they could not afford to be married because of the tax policy of this country]. 
Now, isn't that something we ought to deal with posthaste? Isn't it something we ought to say right now, let us have a vote on this so we can send the right sort of signal to Sharon and Darryl in Indiana and to Philip in Union, KY, and Bobby and Susan in Marietta, GA? They said: `We can't afford to get married because of the Federal tax policy.' 
This is a gentleman from Columbus, OH. 
I am engaged to be married [he says] and my fiancee and I have discussed the fact that we will be penalized financially. We have postponed the date of our marriage in order to save up and have a `running start' in part because of this nasty, unfair tax structure. 
`Nasty, unfair tax structure.' 
Those aren't quite the type of words that we use in the Senate all the time. But he has calculated, figured it up, and said, `Well, OK, I want to get married, and we want to do a lot of things as a family, but the first thing we have to do is pay more in taxes.' 
Is that the sort of policy that we want to send forward? Is that the sort of thing that we want the American public to look at and to hear about? Is that the sort of thing that we want to support as a policy, as a family values policy of this Congress? 
Here is Christopher from Baltimore, MD: 
I am a 23-year-old and a marriage penalty victim for four years now. I am a union electrician who works hard to put food on the table to take care of my family. 
Then he asked the simple question, `Why is the government punishing me just because I'm married?" 
Why are we? Why aren't my Democrat colleagues willing to let me have a vote, let us have a vote, on a bill that most of them would support, as well, to do away with the marriage tax penalties? Are they just fearful we will give the American public back some of their money and will direct it to families who need it the most, young families just starting out, union electricians, who want a little bit more of their tax money back? 
Two-wage-earner families is who this tax is actually targeted toward. We are actually taxing them more. Aren't we concerned about two-wage-earner families struggling heroically? This is a great direct shot at helping them build their family units. 
Why won't my colleagues from the other side of the aisle let us vote on this? Let's just have a vote on this and see. I would think we would have a lot of people support it. Don't block this vote. 
Scott from Palmdale, CA: 
If you want more of something reward it; if you want less punish it monetarily. 
That is a basic principle that is used in the Tax Code frequently. 
If you want more family units, reward them financially. Then maybe the statistic will drop that says 70 percent of divorces are due to money challenges. 
That is a pretty fundamental principle on this basis of how we run this Government. 
We have places that we can send signals out there. We can send signals out through legislation, we can send signals through regulation, and we can send signals through tax policy in this country. The tax policy in this country is that if you tax something more, you will punish it; if you tax something less, you will reward it. We are actually taxing two-wage-earner families more. And do we ask them to get less of that--is that what we are asking to get less of? 
This is Christopher, from Fairfield, OH: 
One of the biggest shocks my wife and I had when deciding to get married was how much more we would have to give to the government because we decided to be married rather than live together. 
Here are people, figuring, calculating, looking and saying: OK, now what will we do here?  
It does not make sense that I was allowed to keep a larger portion of my pay on a Friday and less of it on a Monday with the only difference being that I was married that weekend. 
That is pretty succinct, as well. 
The only difference was that I was married that weekend. 
From Andrew and Connie from Alexandria, VA--real close: 
We grew up together and began dating when we were 18. After dating for three years we decided that the next natural step in our lives together would be to get married. I cannot tell you the joy this has brought us. I must tell you that the tax penalty that was inflicted on us has been the only real source of pain that our marriage has suffered. 
So here is a couple that dated for 3 years, when they were 18 they started dating--much joy; the only pain that has been inflicted is the tax increases that they suffered for getting married. 
Here is Andrew, from Greenville, NC: 
It is unfortunate that the government makes a policy against the noble and sacred institution of marriage. I feel it is unfortunate that it seems to hit young struggling couples the hardest. 
That is great Greenville, NC. 
If you look at the category of those hitting the marriage tax--and, again, I refer to the chart from the National Center for Policy Analysis--it is couples making, combined, $20,000 and $75,000 of earned income, two-wage-earner couples in that category, frequently young, married couples, starting their family. So that while this tax penalty actually hits 21 million married couples, it is hitting far more in the way of children. It is hitting young children at some of the most vulnerable 
times in their lives. 
This is something that really was one of the most perverse signals we could possibly send. It is directed mostly at younger couples. It is when they are starting their families. It is at a time when people are deciding to get married or not to get married, and we send this perverse tax signal that you have to send more money that you are making to the Federal Government. If anything, we should be sending them a bonus at that particular point in time. 
Why won't my Democratic colleagues let us vote on this? Why won't they let us do this? That just doesn't seem to make sense, why they wouldn't let us vote on this narrow issue. On the issue of fairness, they say we need to bring up other tax policy issues. We brought up a lot of tax increase issues. We are finally talking about a tax cut issue. We should be willing and able to vote on this sort of issue now. 
This is Thomas, from Ohio. He writes: 
No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill [that is, to eliminate the marriage tax penalty]. 
No person who legitimately supports family values could be against this bill. The marriage penalty is but another example of how in the past 40 years the federal government has enacted policies that have broken down the fundamental institutions that were the strength of this country from the start. 
I don't know how any more clearly you could put that as an issue. Why would we continue to propound that? We may have somewhere around 30 or 40 legislative days left in this Congress. 
My point in bringing this up at this point in time is, we aren't having a lot of chance to be able to correct wrongs on other bills other than appropriations that are moving through the legislative body. We have to move appropriations bills through. We should move appropriations bills through. We will not be getting a lot of these other issues up--tax policy, particularly dealing with this most onerous tax on married couples, marriage tax penalty. Why won't we deal with this now? We are trying to deal with it on the legislative branch appropriations bill, as well. This is a good vehicle to deal with it. It funds the institutions of the Congress here. So we are saying let's deal with this one now on this short legislative calendar that we have while we have the resources to be able to do it. 
This is Sean, from Jefferson City, MO. He wrote this: 
I think the marriage penalty is a major cause of the breakdown of the family here in the U.S. 
He is citing it as a major cause of the breakdown of the family here in the United States. 
[Ending it] would cut down on the incidence of cohabitation by unmarried couples and give more children two-parent families where there is a real commitment between the parents. 
I am not certain about what he said earlier, but I think it is the proper signal for us to send to families, particularly the young and struggling ones. 
From Houston, TX: 
If we are really interested in putting children first, why would this country penalize the very situation, marriage, where kids do best? 
A lot of single parents struggle heroically to raise children, and we don't want to penalize them. The amendment I want to put forward does not penalize them. It does not penalize them. It simply says a two-wage-earner married couple, earning between $20,000 and $75,000, you shouldn't penalize either. When parents are truly committed to each other through their marriage vows, their children's outcomes are enhanced. 
That is Gary and Carla from Houston, TX. 
This couple from New Castle, VA: 
I am a 61-year-old grandmother, still holding down a full-time job and I remarried 3 years ago. 
This is astounding. 
I had to think long and hard about marriage over staying single as I knew it would cost us several thousand dollars a year just to sign the marriage license. Marriage has become a contract between two individuals and the Federal Government. 
In this lady's estimation, from New Castle, VA: 
Marriage is a contract between two individuals and the Federal Government. 
She had to think long and hard about whether to stay single or get married because she couldn't afford the taxes. That is an extraordinary situation and ought to be corrected as soon as possible. 
Here is from Chicago, IL: 
We read that representative Jerry Weller of Illinois is one of a group of sophomore legislators pushing for an end to the marriage penalty. We do not believe this effort should be a partisan effort and strongly feel that members of both parties should join together to right this wrong and that Congress should do it quickly. 
Well, that is what we are trying to do here today, and to do this quickly. It should be done. It can be done. We need to do it. We need to do it on this vehicle. That is why we are putting this forward now. 
This is from Pennsylvania: 
My wife and I have actually discussed the possibility of obtaining a divorce, something neither of us wants or believes in, especially myself, simply because my family cannot afford to pay the price. 
Is that a horrendous statement to have from Jeffrey in Pennsylvania?--keeping the names somewhat anonymous. 
My wife and I have actually discussed the possibility of obtaining a divorce, something neither of us wants or believes in, especially myself, simply because my family cannot afford to pay the price. 
My goodness, that is something we just have to collect. This is the Ottawa Daily Times. 
According to Edward McCaffery, a law professor at the University of Southern California and California Institute of Technology and author of `Taxing Women,' in an article in the University of Chicago Press: 
The marriage penalty is essentially a tax on working wives, because the joint filing system compels married couples to identify a primary earner and a secondary earner, and usually the wife falls into the latter category. Therefore, from an accountant's point of view, the wife's first dollar of income is taxed at the point where her husband's income has left her. 
Or that can be reversed to the category where the wife's income exceeds the husband's. 
If the husband is making substantially more money than the wife, the couple may even conclude that it is not worth it for the wife to earn income. In fact, McCaffery's book details the plight of one woman who realized her job was actually losing money for her family. 
Her job was actually losing money for her family. Now, that is a horrid situation that is taking place. This is in the book, `Taxing Women,' by Edward McCaffery, a law professor at the University of Southern California and the California Institute of Technology. 
This next one is from the Ottawa Daily Times: 
You try and be honest to do things straight, and you get penalized for it. That's just not right. 
That was from Illinois. 
I don't know how better to summarize it than how the people across America have summarized it in these particular voices from across the country. Those are pretty good summaries. It raises the point of why I am so adamant that we need to deal with this issue now. I cannot understand why my Democrat colleagues want to block this issue--even under some notion of the fairness of them having a tax bill and us having a tax bill. I can't believe they would be opposed to this tax bill, which is on two-wage-earner families. I don't see this as a Republican or Democrat issue. This is an American issue, an issue of family values, which we all support, and we have very few legislative days left to deal with it. It needs to be dealt with now. 
What could couples do with this money if they had the $1,400 that the average couple currently pays? Some people would do different things. They could pay electric bills for 9 months averaging $103 a month. They could pay for 3 or 4 months of day care if they had that $1,400 back--in some places it is higher, and in some it is lower. They could pay for a 5-day vacation to Disneyland if they wanted to with that $1,400. A package rate concludes a double room, a Disneyland hotel, and entry into the entertainment park for mom, dad, and two kids. I think that is a much better place to put this money, if people would just take off to Disneyland with their family in tow. I don't know if those rates still apply or not. Or they could make four or five payments on a minivan, which average $300 to $350 a month. It seems everybody needs a minivan anymore. Or they could eat out 35 times in a restaurant, with the meals averaging $40. They could buy 1,053 gallons of gasoline at $1.33 a gallon. They could purchase 1,228 loaves of bread, with an average loaf costing $1.14. 
Now, ask anybody here, should these married couples spend the money on those things, or should they send it to us in penalty? I think they have better places to be able to put their own resources. So that is why I am so adamant that we not go on to this spending bill until we help American families with their spending. The ability to pay 9 months of electric bills is important. 
I don't intend to just occupy my colleagues' time with this. This is an important issue that I think needs to be raised, and it needs to be seen, and it needs to be heard. There hasn't been a whole lot of discussion on this particular issue. I see other colleagues, and I would be willing to let them speak if they desire. I don't want to block them. I do want to raise this issue of consciousness across the American public on this particular issue of the marriage penalty. That is why I have been talking on this point and why I raise it on this legislative branch appropriations bill.

Mr. BROWNBACK. A community in Kansas called Colwich receives their drinking water from private wells. When the county tested a sampling of the wells in this community they discovered that 81 percent of the wells are poorly constructed, 75 percent are improperly located, 29 percent experience bacterial problems and 6 percent have levels of nitrates greater than the EPA recommended level. Senator Chafee, as a cosponsor to the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, is it your opinion that providing DWSRF money to the community of Colwich will enable the families of Colwich to have safe drinking water and will further the health objectives of this Act?

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank very much the Senator from Kentucky. I, too, ask that I be added as a cosponsor of this bill. 
I applaud the leadership of Senator McConnell, and the leadership of the majority leader, Trent Lott, in moving this forward rapidly. 
I think the number of people who have spoken on the floor about the issue of food and that it should never, ever be used as a political weapon or tool in foreign policy, speaks clearly with the mind of the Senate that it doesn't work. Food being used as a political tool or as a tool of foreign policy should never, ever occur. 
Hopefully, as we move forward on some reforms, that will be a point of agreement, something with which everybody agrees: Food is never, ever to be used. It only hurts the people and hurts our farmers in the United States. So I congratulate my colleagues. 
I particularly recognize my colleague from Kansas who has been a leading proponent in agriculture and agricultural trade for many years in the Congress, now in the U.S. Senate. We need to move this legislation, and we need to move it now. 
Senator Robb and I just got back 10 days ago--actually less than that, 7 days ago--from a trip to India and Pakistan. We met with the prime ministers of both countries. We met with the defense and foreign policy leadership in both countries, and we saw areas that they want to engage with the United States, feel they have definite security needs--both India and Pakistan --that they are responding to and are having difficulty in understanding us throwing the book at them. 
I think we need to work now, obviously, in lifting this particular sanction on food. It should not be in place, period, anyway. It should be lifted rapidly, and I am glad to see the leadership doing that. 
We next need to work on lifting the rest of the sanctions. We need to do it, in my estimation, rapidly. Pakistan is in crisis. They have less than 2 months foreign reserves of funds left to meet their debt loans. They have lost half of the valuation of their stock market. We need to do so rapidly. 
We need to move forward in a way that reduces tension in the region, and this is a key point as well. We went to the line of control between Pakistan and India, and tensions are high. At the time we were there, 11 people were bombed and killed on the Pakistani side--just the time we were there. We met with a number of villagers who had been wounded at some point in time in the last 6 to 12 months. They were showing us the wounds they had. We have to act in a way that reduces tension. We have to act in a way that re-engages the United States in the region. 
I am convinced we can do all of these things. This is a good first step. We have to further engage. I think we have to engage the United States broadly in the region with India and Pakistan. 
There were a number of concerns raised by India while we were there at the same time the President was in China, saying that they were reacting to perceived threats from China that they have stated publicly and they were saying to Senator Robb and myself as well. 
On Monday, Senator Robb and I will be hosting a hearing in the Foreign Relations subcommittee that deals with the Indian subcontinent on the issue of how can we next move forward with lifting the remainder of these sanctions in a way that we can do so rapidly, that helps the countries involved, that doesn't hurt unequally countries like Pakistan and India, that reduces tension in the region, and works rapidly to move this issue forward. We need to do so. 
I am delighted to see that we are dealing with this issue of food. We do need to deal with the rest of the issues, particularly in the economic areas. We do need to deal with the areas of reducing tension in the region. I am convinced we can do all of this. We need to be back up in front of this body quickly, again, with the steps we need to take to further engage the United States in lifting the sanctions in this region. 
I congratulate the leadership on moving this forward. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Today, Senator Lieberman and I will host a policy forum entitled `The Young and the Violent: What is Behind the Spread of Juvenile Violence--and What Can Be Done About It?' 
The horror of the killings in Jonesboro, Arkansas; Paducah, Kentucky; Edinboro, Pennsylvania, Springfield, Oregon; Fayetteville, Tennessee, among other places, shattered forever the illusion that `it can't happen here.' The young and the violent are found in small towns as well as big cities, and their numbers, as well as their crimes, are growing. 
We will hear today from some of the most respected criminologists in the nation--as well as those who are working to transform their communities and solve their problems locally. Their insights on the causes, catalysts and consequences of the spread of juvenile crime are helpful in grappling with the most important questions of our time, namely: why has crime risen and civility declined? How have we failed to civilize our children? What is happening to our national character? 
Make no mistake, our culture has changed radically over the past few decades. Since the mid-1960s, violent juvenile crime has increased more than 500 percent. And even though teen violence has dropped over the past three years, teen murders have jumped dramatically since even the early 1980s--and there is reason to believe that they will continue to increase. 
Not only have the rates and number of juvenile crimes increased, but they have changed in nature as well. Juvenile crime has grown increasingly predatory--where teens kill strangers for the most trivial of matters--a jacket, or a dirty look--or even worse, for sport. 
Moreover, the young and the violent are found in rural and suburban areas, as well as the inner cities. Gangs and guns are ever more visible in our schools. Fistfights begin to seem quaint by comparison. Violence that was once unthinkable now fails to shock. In our schools, and across the nation, we have, to borrow a phrase from my colleague Senator Moynihan, `defined deviancy down.' 
This forum seeks answers to the questions of why kids kill, why teen violence is on the rise, and what can be done about it. Of course, there are no easy answers. But there are a lot of contributing factors. 
Perhaps the single most important factor is the continued breakdown of the American family. Today, almost a third of all children are born out of wedlock. Around half of all children will live in a broken home before they turn 18. Tens of millions of little boys and girls will grow up without a loving and committed father. 
There are other cultural warning signs. Popular entertainment continues to glamorize violence. Movies and computer games grow ever more gory and grisly. Chart-topping songs feature lyrics celebrating torture, rape, and murder. 
Glorifying violence in popular entertainment--whether it be music, or movies, or video games--is dangerous. It is dangerous because a society that glorifies violence will grow more violent. 
We had a hearing recently on the issue of music lyrics. One person made the point along this line and said that if John Philip Sousa's music makes us feel patriotic, and if other music, like Frank Sinatra's, makes us feel romantic, what does music that is violent make us feel? 
If it is hateful, if it is anti-women, if it is oriented towards death and destruction, we think that is going to make us feel that way--that music will just wrap around your soul and cause some distortions to take place. 
But most importantly, this discussion will focus on ways to prevent, curtail, and combat teen violence--whether on the Congressional, state, local, or societal level. 
I hope that we will gain insight not only on the proper government policies to deter and combat crime, but also on non-governmental initiatives--including those by churches, faith-based organizations, and charities--that have reached out to troubled youth, and succeeded where government has failed. 
One of the great things about our nation is that for each of our problems, there are people who are living and working the solution. In churches, youth groups, schools, charities, and families across the nation, miracles are every day taking place. These groups show what is possible by what is actual--that is, their real-life success stories should inspire us with the possibilities. 
We in Congress need to enact wise and prudent crime-fighting policies. But we also need to allow these small, often faith-based groups to touch the souls and transform the lives of those in need. 
Mr. President, I know that you, as the Presiding Officer and a Senator in this body, know full well the problems that we are facing in this culture and in this society, and the increase in the violent nature of what is happening here. We are all troubled and very perplexed by it. 
What we are hoping with this discussion and policy forum that Senator Lieberman and I have today is that we will be able to begin the national dialog--actually not only begin but continue the national dialog--about what each of us can do now to become a more civilized country to stop the violence from growing. 
Abe Lincoln made a point that the United States frequently is a nation that moves to a common thought. I think today we have decided we have focused in on saying this is a major problem. Youth violence is a major problem. What can each of us in our individual capacities and our capacities in this body, or in other places--in our communities and homes, in our churches and synagogues--do to solve this problem? 
That is what we are going to focus on today--some of the individual solutions that have taken place, what are appropriate governmental policies. But, more importantly, let's get to the common thought on how to start solving this growing problem in America. 
I invite my colleagues to tune in to this policy forum that we will have starting today at 2:30. I hope some of them will be willing to join us and follow the subsequent proceedings as we pick up this debate and try to carry it on forward. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Byrd amendment and speak in favor of that amendment. I will not take very long, but I do want to draw some points of attention to my colleagues. 
This amendment is about separate barracks and separate training. We had a thorough debate on this yesterday, so I don't need to speak for a long period of time. This amendment, in my estimation, is a very sensible step in restoring privacy and dignity to the military basic training experience. 
The amendment codifies--I want to make this point very clear to my colleagues--this amendment, actually more than the one I put forward yesterday, this amendment codifies the Kassebaum-Baker recommendation, a unanimous commission, a bipartisan recommendation of separate-gender barracks facilities, and this goes on to say also during basic training separate-gender training. 
This is also what has passed the House. So if my colleagues ask the question, Is this moving too far forward? I want to point a couple things out to them. This is the unanimous recommendation of the Kassebaum-Baker commission. This is the recommendation. This is what has passed the House of Representatives. This is what the Marines currently do, and it is what most of the branches, up until this decade, did as well. 
But the sole point I actually want to make to my colleagues is this. We have had a good airing of this. When you come down to vote on this bill, will you please think of your daughters and your sons and sending them to basic training? I just ask and beg of you, please just think about your 18-year-old children. 
And when you send them off to basic training--would you ask yourself, as you vote: Do I want to send my young daughter--in my case, Abby and Liz--do I want to send my 18-year-old daughter to basic training--I want them to serve their country; I really do want them to serve their country--but do I want to send them to basic training, 18 years old, and be able to have a male drill sergeant come in and out at any time of the day or night, such as in the cases that have taken place and take place? 
Do I want to have them in the same barracks facility as other 18-year-old men, who, at the end of the day, may be looking for other things to do? Is that where I want to put Abby and Elizabeth? Is that where you want to put your daughters, your children? 
This is not a wild idea or notion that Senator Byrd has put forward. It is common sense. It is the thing we ought to do. And so when the Senators cast their votes tonight, I hope when they write down that vote, they will think about their daughters, their granddaughters, their sons, their grandsons, and America, and ask, What is really best here? 
Let us not hide behind another commission. A lot of people just want to do that--`Let's have another commission'--and we will do a commission until it reports out the way some people want. Let us just do what we know is right, what we have been doing with the Kassebaum-Baker commission reports, what has already passed, and let us pass the Byrd amendment. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a resolution calling upon the Administration to do its utmost to protect the personal security of President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia. Against overwhelming odds, President Shevardnadze has fought for his country's sovereignty and independence and has led it to a position where it is starting to achieve positive economic growth and is making great strides towards democracy. President Shevardnadze is a world class leader, and he and his country are natural allies of the United States in a part of the world that is crucial to the geo-political interests of the United States. 
President Shevardnadze has accomplished these great achievements under the most difficult circumstances one could imagine. There have been two assassination attempts in the last three years alone and he has been working tirelessly to reach peaceful resolution with the separatist forces within Georgia. As if this weren't difficult enough, he has had to do this in the face of continual undermining by certain forces within the Russian Federation. 
A case in point is Abkhazia: since the break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia has been using Abkhazia to maintain control in Georgia and in the Caucasus: the Russians encouraged separatists forces, armed and supported with fighters, intelligence and air power and used the resultant instability to force President Shevardnadze and Georgia to join the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
Russia also used this weakness to force the presence of Russian bases on Georgian territory. President Shevardnadze was forced to sign the military base agreement allowing Russia troops to be stationed in Georgia without compensation, in fact Georgia is forced to pay Russia. And when he objected, President Shevardnadze was told point blank by the Russian Prime Minister either to sign the base agreement or Russia would put someone else in his place to sign it. 
Russian strategy in Georgia appears to be a combination of factors driven by those who seek to pay President Shevardnadze back for his dismantling of the Soviet empire, and those who seek to prevent Caspian oil and other commerce from following through Georgia to the West, and who wish to break Georgia's increasingly close ties to the West and to the United States in particular. 
The destabilizing activities have not stopped and include attempts to assassinate President Shevardnadze himself. On August 29, 1995 he narrowly survived a car bomb attack as he departed his offices in the Georgian Parliament building to attend the signing ceremony for the new constitution of Georgia. The former Chief of the Georgian National Security Service, Lieutenant General Igor Giorgadze, after being implicated in organizing this attempt on President Shevardnadze's life, escaped to Moscow after fleeing Georgia from the Russian-controlled Varziani airbase on a Russian military aircraft. 
Since that time, Giorgadze has been spotted on a number of occasions in Moscow and the Georgians have repeatedly requested his extradition to Georgia. But despite the specificity of the information presented to them about Giogadze's whereabouts in Russia, the Russian Interior Ministry has claimed repeatedly that it is unable to locate Mr. Giorgadze. In short, Russia has refused to extradite him to Georgia for trial. 
Further, Mr. President, another violent attempt was made on President Shevardnadze's life in February of this year. Here again, the perpetrators of this heinous act fled Georgia from a Russian military base. And barely a month later, two escort planes which were to escort the President's flight from the Turkish border on a return flight to the Georgian capital Tbilsi, were found sabotaged and inoperable, thus forcing the President's plane to return unescorted and unprotected and in direct danger of air attack. Those disabled planes, Mr. President, were sabotaged while on the ground in a Russian military base in Georgia. 
Throughout all these events, the Administration has remained shockingly silent. This is unacceptable behavior towards a friend an ally. In the face of the clear pattern of destabilization in which Russia is engaged, the Administration should not have to be prodded to stand up and speak loudly in defense of this friend and ally. Unfortunately, a reticence to engage Russia on its bad behavior in Georgia and the Caucasus has led to an unacceptable passivity on the part of the Administration. It is time for this to change. And it must change soon. 
There is no need to remind my colleagues that Title II of the Foreign Operations Appropriations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, prohibits assistance to any government of the former Soviet Union if that government directs any action in violation of the national sovereignty of any other new independent state. 
The sense of the senate I am introducing today calls upon the Administration to step up its pressure on Russia to extradite Igor Giorgadze, the alleged perpetrator of the August 1995 assassination attempt on President Shevardnadze; and to stop using its bases in Georgia as an escape for assassins and terrorists; and to provide all assistance necessary to provide for the personal safety of President Shevardnadze. 
This resolution is just a first step. I believe the United States should be pressing Russia to remove its bases from Russia--after all, they are there against the will of the Georgian people. And I now call upon the Administration to stand up for President Shevardnadze and for Georgia, and to publicly and loudly condemn the efforts of any group that seeks to destabilize Georgia. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending this message and will support this resolution.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to discuss today the amendment I have offered that I put forward at the desk and will, at the appropriate time, be calling for the yeas and nays on that. 
I have discussed my amendment with the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Personnel of the Armed Services Committee, the distinguished Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne. And after my staff had briefings with the Pentagon, I decided the privacy of our new recruits, by mandating separate barracks, was extremely important and that this debate was necessary and needed at this point in time. 
Mr. President, my amendment is common sense. It simply requires separate barracks for male and female recruits during basic training. Further, the amendment protects the privacy of recruits by limiting access to barracks after hours to those of the same gender. 
I might note for the Senators that the House has considered much stronger language, and actually enacted in their bill, in the DOD authorization, the separation of genders during basic training. But we fall far short of that. This is just about barracks and housing during basic training. 
I believe this is a sensible step in restoring privacy and dignity to the military basic training experience and will allow our young recruits to focus on the serious tasks before them. 
This amendment helps to uphold the military standards of behavior and improves the quality of life for military members and spouses left at home while a loved one completes basic training. 
The amendment will help train instructors to instill the basic core values of discipline, teamwork, unit cohesion, and values that will ultimately benefit the individual, the family, and the military. By adopting this amendment, we codify a unanimous recommendation of the bipartisan Kassebaum-Baker commission. 
The Kassebaum-Baker Commission interviewed 2,000 recruits, 2,000 recruits, and their supervisors and found serious problems. Let me just articulate a few of them. The commission recognized that sexual relations take place inside of barracks where young men and women live together. Moral and unit cohesion were negatively affected. Thus, the commission recommended that male and female recruits sleep in separate barracks. Talk about common sense, that seems to be it. 
To avoid cries that the cost is prohibitive, the Kassebaum Commission completed an analysis of the current structures at training installations which showed that the cost of this amendment is marginal. Mr. President, I will read the section of the Kassebaum Commission that says just that, quoting from page 15 of the study of the Kassebaum Commission: 
The committee has reviewed the layout and surge numbers of the training installation and believes this change can be accomplished at marginal cost, if any. 
Available barracks exist and have already been converted to accommodate both male recruits. Thus, there are no physical constraints to having men and women recruits housed separately during basic training. Existing structures can be used. The Kassebaum panel was stunned to discover--and this is a direct quote--`high frequency' of sexual relations during basic training between male and female recruits in all branches of the services. High frequency. 
Now, if you think about this, if you put young male and female recruits around the age of 18 in close proximity, in the same quarters, I think there is a possibility that a high frequency of this may happen. The amendment that I put forward simply says we should have separate barracks. It doesn't even go to wanting separate training. It says separate `barracks,' to maybe reduce some of these incidents. 
The same report said `some drill sergeants complained to the panel about the large amount of time they were spending investigating or disciplining male and female misconduct. It was found that the problem is exacerbated in mixed-gender barracks. This is after interviewing 2,000 recruits and sergeants. It is exacerbated in mixed-gender barracks, especially where men and women live on the same floor. 
Just think about it again, in common-sense terms. Doesn't this just make sense that you will have more problems if you have mixed genders on same floor in the same barracks, and that you will then have to deal with that in basic training? 
Listen to this. At one location at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, the panel was told that male and female fraternization was so frequent that drill instructors had to take the doors off of the barracks rooms so they could maintain order inside. It was that frequent. They had to take the doors off. 
Secretary Cohen gave the services an opportunity to respond to the Kassebaum recommendations. Other than the marines, God bless 'em, they all came back and disagreed with the recommendation to establish separate living barracks. Despite this, I believe that there is no reason why male and female recruits should be sleeping on the same floors. This makes no sense. 
I put it in personal terms, if I could, for my colleagues. Think about their daughters, if they are going into the military. I have two young daughters. What if they were going in. Would you feel safer and better about their security and about this issue of fraternization if, during basic training, 
they are in separate facilities, or would you feel better and safer about it if they are on the same floor with different genders? Just think about that for half a second. Wouldn't you feel a lot better about it if they are in separate barracks so that people can watch a little closer than if they are on the same floor with other recruits and you already have these instances taking place? 
This is a common-sense proposal with minimal, if any, cost. This is about national security and ensuring our recruits make up the best, most disciplined force in the world. Just last month, we learned that five instructors at the Navy's boot camp have been accused of sexual misconduct and improper relations with women recruits. This is the Navy, not the Army; this is the Navy. One of the instructors at the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, a 30-year-old, was arrested on April 30 on charges of having an improper sexual relationship with an 18-year-old female recruit. 
I want to read some of the press account that is out of this, from the Chicago Sun Times, June 6, 1998.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to address further the issue of cost on this, because some will allege that is the reason we should block this, because it puts a cost figure of $166 million, $190 million. I am very sensitive to the cost issue, so I provide for the authorization. 
But I also challenge my colleagues on this very point to think about this. Basic training for 9 weeks, pressurized environment. It is where you teach, train, build, and mold--9 weeks of a focused, intense time period that is taking place. You are putting somebody 18 years old, male and female, into that pressurized environment. Is this a place for us to cut costs in the military, saying because of that cost we have to force them onto the same floor and the same common area because we cannot afford the $166 million? 
Mind you, the Kassebaum Commission says we can do this at zero to minimal cost. We can do this with minimal, if any, cost. 
Let's say it does have some cost with it. I don't think it does. I don't support that notion. Anyway, if you are 18 years old looking at going into the military, isn't this a pretty minimal amount of cost? If you are the family of that 18-year-old considering going into the military, is that a cost that you want the Government to be putting forth and being a part of? My goodness, we have to make some sense out of this. 
This is a very narrow amendment that we are asking for. I hope we have a direct vote on this. I hope we will be able to get to it. I will learn my lessons quickly. So I hope we can get to a vote on this particular issue. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will be asking for the yeas and nays at the appropriate time on this. I plead with my colleagues to really consider this. 
I ask them really just one small, simple favor: Will they call their constituent services' offices to see how many recruits they have been contacted by back home during this past year asking for relief from military duty because they were sexually assaulted, got pregnant at basic training or at training, and see what the numbers are in their particular office? One is too many. But I would be interested to see how many of them have had multiple contacts in their office. 
We shouldn't ignore this anymore. We should deal with it. This is a minor request we should be making. 
With that, Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays at the proper time. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. 
I would like to respond to a few things that have been stated here about what we are talking about and what we are not talking about in the final minutes that I have in this debate. 
No. 1 is, what we are talking about is separate barracks during basic training--separate barracks during basic training. We are not talking about further training; we are not talking about deployment, any of those issues that are being raised as a smokescreen by others. We are not talking about separation. We are talking about the 9 weeks of basic training, separate barracks. 
All right, that is No. 1. No. 2 is we are also talking about limited access by trainers of the opposite sex after hours. We have had instances--we have had court-martials. Even this month we have had a court-martial take place in the Navy involving that type of situation. 
So what we are saying is if you are of the opposite gender, you can't go into the facility where the other gender is staying after hours other than in emergency cases. 
Those are the two things we are talking about. Those are intimate issues and they have eminent common sense about them, plus I might add being backed up by the Kassebaum-Baker commission, the Army survey that I showed, the CRS study that I also cited earlier. 
So I have three studies on this point as well as making what basically most people would say is pretty much common sense about this issue. We are not talking about separate training. Senator Byrd was going to have an amendment along that line, and I think he has some wisdom with it, but we are not talking about that sort of issue. 
Some are saying, look, we don't have a problem. Well, I cited to you the court-martial that has taken place at the Great Lakes Navy basic training facility, and I read the quotes from some of the people involved in that horrible instance as to what took place there. 
I would also cite to you some other problem areas. We did some surveying of the military on these issues. We asked them about official reprimands in instances in the last 12 months involving trainers and trainees. The Army gave us 53 that were involved in article 15s over the last 2 years involving trainers and trainees. That is a lot that were involved in this type of situation. 
Also I want to cite--and there was one thing the Senator from Michigan cited saying that this isn't a particular problem. We have got those in that particular case, and the services do not want to do this. Well, the Army and Navy and the Air Force may not. The Marines think that separate training and separate barracks is the way to go and they are having fewer instances that they are reporting. 
I want to cite another study. This is the Department of Defense 1995 sexual harassment study. This one is amazing if you look at it. They are talking about the progress taking place. In 1995, they surveyed their personnel and 55 percent of the women in the Army, 55 percent of the women surveyed in this Department of Defense study said they had some type of sexual 
harassment taking place within the last year. Listen to how this breaks down. Actual or attempted rape or assault, 4 percent of the women surveyed said that this had happened to them; pressure for sexual favors, 11 percent; touching or cornering, 29 percent. 
This is the 1995 Department of Defense sexual harassment study. We don't have a problem? We have a significant problem taking place. 
I have other studies to cite here, but what I want to get to with this is to say that we have a current and present problem and danger involved in this situation. We are talking about an amendment of very limited scope. 
We can do studies until we find one that comes out the way we want it to come out, and I suppose if we keep appointing people that may happen. The commission that has been appointed has a much broader purview than this narrow issue of the barracks. 
It says the duties of the commission shall be to: 
Review the current practices of the Armed Forces, relevant studies, and private sector training concepts pertaining to gender-integrated training. 
OK, but it also says: 
Review the laws, regulations, policies, directives, and practices that govern personal relationships between men and women in the Armed Forces and personal relationships between members of the Armed Forces and nonmilitary personnel of the opposite sex. 
That is broader than just the barracks during basic training we are talking about. 
Assess the extent to which the laws, regulations, policies, and directives have been applied consistently throughout the Armed Forces without regard to the Armed Force, grade, or rank of the individuals involved. 
Whether or not everybody is being reviewed similarly: 
Examine the experiences, policies, and practices of the Armed Forces of other industrialized nations regarding gender-integrated training. 
Training: We are not talking about training here. We are just talking about barracks during basic training. 
My point is that some would say we have appointed this commission and to not let it go on through; by doing this, that we are overruling the commission. This is a very broad-based commission. We have a clear and present problem in basic training that just earlier this month on June 5 we have a court-martial taking place at the Navy training grounds, and we have got 53 instances being reported in the last 2 years by the Army--53 official reprimands. 
I get calls to my office by people asking to be released from the military because of sexual harassment that has happened to them in basic training. 
Do we need another year to study this? Do we need another year to contemplate this? 
My own staff then goes down to Fort Jackson to look at the situation because there is an issue regarding the common area that is involved here: Let's just put them in the same facility, but we will put them on different floors or separate, different wings out here, but then we have a common area together. 
My own staff was told about, well, there was sexual activities taking place, on the fire escape and in the telephone booth. Where there is a will there is a way, I guess. But my point is, if you are going to put young 18-year-old recruits in the same place in a pressurized environment and you are going to provide some chances, this is going to happen. 
What we are saying is let's just put them in separate facilities by 2001. Let's give it some time, common sense, so we can get this put into place, and that is specifically and 
only what we are talking about. And let's limit the supervisors, the trainers being able to go into the trainees' facilities of the opposite sex after hours other than for emergency cases because we have had some really horrible instances taking place there. 
So, Mr. President, I think if you look at the preponderance of evidence that is here with all the studies that have been done, we can do yet another one, and if this one doesn't come out the way we want, I suppose we may do yet another one, but we have enough. We have a real problem today--and this is going to really catch up with us--of recruits coming into the military. 
This is a simple proposal, a simple matter. We don't need to put it off for another commission to study this. The evidence is overwhelming and the findings have been overwhelming to date. 
So with that, Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues to vote against the Snowe amendment. Let us have a vote on this very simple issue of separate barracks and not having members of the opposite sex in the quarters after hours other than for emergency cases. That is all that we are asking for in this particular amendment. 
So please vote no on the Snowe amendment so we can put the Kassebaum commission into place. 
With that, Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, 
last month, following India's nuclear tests, I offered legislation to repeal section 620(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (otherwise known as the Pressler amendment). The Pressler amendment concerns restriction on the provision of military assistance and other transfers to Pakistan. When Pakistan blundered into responding to India's nuclear tests with tests of its own, this amendment not only became pointless symbolically, but because of existing sanctions law it was no longer relevant. 
How rapidly events change. Last month when I proposed to repeal Pressler, the world was reacting in stunned disbelief to India's nuclear tests. At the time it seemed our only hope in stalling an all out nuclear arms race in South Asia was to offer Pakistan some security assurances, while at the same time urging them in the strongest terms not to be drawn into this dangerous display of nuclear saber rattling. Unfortunately, Pakistan did test, and we are now imposing sanctions rather than lifting them. 
The month of May 1998 will be remembered as a time of nuclear anxiety. Tensions were high as the world watched India and Pakistan play nuclear roulette. June has brought some respite; India and Pakistan have declared a moratorium on further nuclear testing, and they are discussing bilateral talks this month. I pray that this nuclear nightmare will pass. 
The question of South Asia's regional security and our future relations with India and Pakistan remain issues of abiding concern. What has happened in South Asia is in many ways an indictment of the administration's failed foreign and nonproliferation policies. Consider that, at this very moment Congress is investigating the administration for its export control policies, particularly as they relate to China. These policies have made possible the wholesale proliferation of missile and nuclear technology, not only to Pakistan, but to others, such as Iran. 
Mr. President, the testing of nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, and the resulting security crisis in South Asia should be of grave concern to all of us. We must continue to condemn India and Pakistan's nuclear tests, and urge them to enact confidence and security building measures to reduce the likelihood of armed conflict. We must encourage a more involved role by the United States in seeking a diplomatic solution, and in providing leadership to resolve the conflict over the disputed territory in Jumma Kashmir. We should urge India and Pakistan to roll back their nuclear programs, and to come into compliance with the NPT. In addition the United States should develop policies which will promote stable, democratic, and economically thriving economies in India and Pakistan. 
Last week the administration implemented sanctions against India and Pakistan. Although the scope of these 
sanctions is limited--ending economic aids, loans, and military sales--they will cast a negative pall on our relations until they are lifted. We should not underestimate the symbolic and economic impact of these sanctions. In India, America-bashing has taken the form of boycotting American products and vandalizing establishments selling them. There are reports that foreign capital is fleeing India and Pakistan, and financial markets there have already been badly hurt. 
It is premature today to talk about lifting these sanctions, but I don't believe it is too early to begin planning for their gradual removal. For that reason I am considering legislation which could provide for the conditional removal of sanctions against India and Pakistan, based upon progress as outlined in the Geneva Communique. 
I think the communiques issued after the P-5 meeting in Geneva, and the G-8 meeting in London are reasonable appeals to India and Pakistan by the nuclear powers. Eighty other nations have joined the P-5 and the G-8 in denouncing these nuclear tests and calling for action by India and Pakistan. But, these appeals will not be met by India and Pakistan simply because they were announced in official communiques. 
The Geneva communique said that confidence building measures, incentives, disincentives, and other actions are steps the international community can take in its relations with India and Pakistan. There are a number of actions we in Congress can take to move this process forward. Here are just a few. 
We can listen to the concerns put forward by the Indian and Pakistani people. This week I will be leading a delegation to India and Pakistan to hold meetings with their leaders. My goal in visiting India and Pakistan is to hear, first hand, the views and concerns of their leadership. I also want to give assurances that this issue is very much on the front burner for the U.S. Congress. As I said in a hearing two weeks ago, it would be folly to isolate India and Pakistan at this time. We must be engaged. Unfortunately, in recent years U.S. foreign policy in India and Pakistan has been one of estrangement, not engagement. 
We can work closely with the administration. This week I plan to invite the State Department Special Coordinator for India and Pakistan and interested members to a round table to explore how we might constructively engage India and Pakistan. I look forward to the results of those meetings. 
In all of this--our meetings, our travel to the region, and our discussions with allies--our goal is to halt the proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Asia, restore regional security, and put our bilateral relationships with India and Pakistan back on track. We should settle for no less. 
Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will ask for the passage of these bills. I do not believe that we will need a rollcall vote. 
Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?

Mr. BROWNBACK. If I may respond to the Senator from Virginia, it was our intent that the United States has put on a set of sanctions via the Glenn amendment that were automatic, and we thought it important to state that if we are going to take that position, we should be urging other nations to do so as well. Yet, in the longer term, as we get further out here, I think we should be dealing in a dialog of, how do we get these lifted on a step-by-step, confidence-building measure? 
At the present time, we are in a unilateral sanctions position, and I think we should urge other nations to join us in that statement, but at the same time I want us to start building the confidence and moving away from those if we can't get other nations to join us in this effort.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, due to the generosity of two entrepreneurs, the children of Kansas City, Kansas have become eligible for a new privately funded scholarship program to provide low-income children the choice of private, parochial or public school. 
Last October, Ted Forstmann and John Walton each contributed $3 million to create a fund for scholarships in Washington, D.C. Their programs were in such high demand--50,000 applications for 3,000 scholarships--that the two businessmen have decided to greatly expand the scope of their scholarship programs. 
Yesterday, Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton joined together to announce the Children's Scholarship Fund, a foundation to award $200 million in scholarships to low-income children around the country, including Kansas. The Children's Scholarship Fund will partner with local entities in an effort to provide children the choice of private, parochial or public education. 
I applaud the generosity of these two entrepreneurs, as well as urge corporate America to follow their lead and aid this effort in their own cities. I also hope that the eligible cities will do all they can to work with the Children's Scholarship Fund, which next year will send at least 50,000 low-income children to the schools of their choice.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a group of outstanding students from the state of Kansas. Cindy Garwick's first grade class from Bluemont Elementary School in Manhattan, Kansas, has been chosen as a finalist team in the Toshiba/National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) Exploravision Awards Program. 
The NSTA Exploravision Awards Program is the largest K-12 student science competition in the country. This year, there were nearly 5,000 entries from more than 17,000 students in the United States and Canada. The class was chosen as a finalist for this prestigious award for their invention display prototype, `The DNA Door Open.' 
It is difficult to imagine how much time and energy was spent on this project by these outstanding young students. The award that they have received is a testament to their hard work and dedication. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge Bluemont Elementary School's first grade class for the honor they have received. I congratulate them and wish them continued success.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the newspapers are full of Kosovo and Serbia, of India and Pakistan and of course, Indonesia. These threatening events have captured most of the headlines and have attracted the attention of the Administration in greater or lesser degrees. These are not trivial issues, and we cannot afford to ignore their importance for challenging US interests. 
But another conflict rages that, while small, challenges US interests in ways that few other conflicts can: I am speaking of the conflict in the Republic of Georgia in the distant but strategically critical region of Abkazia. 
And yet the stability in independent Georgia is one of the principal US interests in the former USSR and should be one of our overriding strategic goals. This is not just sentiment for one of the earliest Christian civilizations in a part of the world where Christian civilizations do not thrive: rather it is a clear statement of our own strategic interest and objectives. 
Georgia is a NATO borderland and an entry point to the emerging new Silk Road. It is a key ally of our partner Turkey and is important in many ways: strategically, militarily, commercially. If Georgia were to become unstable, the entire region would be put in jeopardy. 
Against overwhelming odds, Georgia has achieved strong positive economic growth in the last few years. It is one of the most stable of the post-Soviet states, with world-class leadership in President Eduard Shevardnadze. It is America's natural ally in a neighborhood that features Iran and Iraq. 
Georgia is central to the successful development of what the new Silk Road from Central Europe to China. This ambitious project will eventually encompass pipelines, roads and railroads, airports and communications networks that stretch from Central Europe to China. This corridor will completely alter the economics and the politics of Eurasia in ways that we cannot now foresee, but which are certain to intersect US strategic interests in Eurasia in many places. The states of the Caucasus--Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia--lie at the very center of this new Silk Road. For the corridor to function, stability in these states is essential. 
Not surprisingly, some people wish ardently to jeopardize America's interests in this region by threatening Georgia's stability, and they have fastened on a perverse way of doing so. the small, break-away region of Abkazia has been Russia's best available instrument to diminish Georgia's accomplishments and to imperil its remarkable gains. Russia is the only power to benefit from such activity. Let us not be timid in naming the problem: Russia is the problem, the aggressor and the single-most threat to stability in Georgia and the entire Caucasus. 
Since the early 1990s, Russia, acting through Abkazia, has attempted to bring down Georgia. This is no secret. Virtually every expert to travel to the region reports the same thing: Russia is responsible for arming, training and sustaining Abkazia's so-called freedom fighters. Russia's support for the pro-Russian Abkazian leadership is barely disguised: Russia has funneled arms and support for more than six years into the Abkaz region of Georgia for one specific task: to destabilize the government of Eduard Shevardnadze so that Georgia will be unable to realize its goals of being independent, of joining the community of free democratic nations, and of providing better lives--free lives--for the people of Georgia. 
It is high time the Administration took a strong position on the subject of the Caucasus and of Georgia in particular. So far, it has not only failed to reign in Russian efforts against Georgia, but by this very failure, it has insured that the Russian-promoted destabilization efforts will continue. 
Administartion apathy on this subject is best illustrated by the astonishing lack of urgency that the State Department ascribes to placing qualified and dynamic ambassadors in these countries. Georgia has been without a U.S. ambassador for well over six months. No candidate has yet been identified, let alone brought to the Senate for confirmation, despite persistent and forceful requests by President Shevardnadze and other key leaders in Georgia for such an appointment. 
The Administration has also been supporting the Russian `mediation' of the Abkaz conflict: this policy must be reversed. Russian `mediation' consists of injecting Russian peacekeepers into the region to separate the Georgian and Abkaz combatants. Their behavior in the recent fighting in Abkazia shows their true intentions: the best case scenario shows that the Russian peacekeeping forces did nothing to interdict the flow of separatist personnel and heavy weaponry into the region where the fighting was taking place. The worst case scenario has them actually providing weapons to the Abkaz combatants. This is unacceptable. 
Allowing continued Russian control over this situation is tantamount to inserting the fox's first cousin as a mediator between the foxes and the hens. The current situation insures that Georgia can only lose. It is time for the Administration to demand the removal of the bogus Russian peacekeepers, and to insist on their replacement by an independent force of peacekeepers. To do less is to acknowledge implicitly that Georgia remains within Russia's sphere of control. 
This matter also raises the issue of the continued presence of Russian military bases in Georgia. They are there despite the overwhelming opposition of Georgian citizens. These bases were established at a time when Georgia was in no position to repulse Russian advances. Russia has no legitimate national security claim on Georgia. Russia is no less safe--indeed it is safer--with a Georgia that is free, independent, democratic and with free markets close to its southern border. These bases--from which the perpetrators of the assassination attempts on President Shevardnadze are reported to have fled--must be closed. The United States must not accept the notion that Georgian independence can only be secured by Russian power. Nothing could be more alien to the truth and to our national values. 
Mr. President, it is time for the Administration to state unequivocally that the stability and survival of an independent Georgia is a fundamental U.S. interest. That Russia's collusion with the Abkaz is nothing less than Moscow's effort to maintain control over sovereign Georgia and will not be tolerated; and that it is time to put an end to Russian Trojan horses in Georgia--the phony Russian `peacekeepers' and the military bases that provide Russia with the means to threaten Georgia's future and to put U.S. interests at risk.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to recognize today a young Kansan who has been nationally recognized for her quick thinking and valor. Betty Hood, of Wichita, Kansas, has been awarded the Young American Medal for Bravery for 1996 from the U.S. Department of Justice, for her heroic efforts to save her younger brothers and sister from their burning apartment. 
Then ten-year-old Betty awoke in the early morning of May 17, 1996, to discover that her bed had caught on fire from a lamp that had been left too close to the sheets and blankets. Realizing the danger she and her siblings, who were in the room with her, were in, Betty carried her brother, James and sister, Hallie, to safety. She returned to help her remaining brother Clifford, but was unable to assist him as the fire had spread to the area where he was sleeping. 
Betty Hood's award for bravery is well deserved. She did not escape unharmed, as both Betty and her mother were treated for burns, nor will she ever forget her six-year-old brother, Clifford, who perished in the fire. 
Today, I join the Department of Justice in recognizing and paying tribute to this extraordinary young American. Betty Hood is a true hero, and I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting this young woman for her bravery and quick thinking that saved her brother and sister.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate the Senator from Arizona recognizing me to speak on this very important act. 
The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is more 
important now than ever. I chair the subcommittee in the Foreign Relations Committee which deals with Iran. We have had a number of hearings on this particular issue. We just had a hearing last week on what all Iran is doing around the world. 
It might be of interest for many people in this body to know that, according to the State Department's last report, Iran is operating in some 21 countries around the world with either terroristic actions taking place or building the base for further expansion of their activities and interests and terroristic actions to happen. 
I am sure a number of people have already noted as well the recent finding by the Argentine Government of Iranian-backed terrorists involved with the horrendous bombings that took place in that country earlier this decade. The recent nuclear test by the Indians drives this point home even more. It is more urgent now than it was even 10 days ago to alert the world, and Iran in particular, that the United States will not tolerate an Iranian nuclear program, period. 
The administration has already shown lack of resolve in its recent decisions to waive the sanctions on Total and Gazprom under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. This, in my estimation, was a grave mistake, as the world has now received the message that it is once again free to fill the Iranian coffers and help it pay for the development of its nuclear capability, as well as fund its terrorism activities overseas. 
In the most recent State Department report that was out less than a month ago, Iran is the leading nation around the world sponsoring terrorism as a state. In the State Department's most recent report, Iran is the leader in this most ignoble category. 
We need to make the world understand that Iranian development of an indigenous missile capability, combined with nuclear capability, is dangerous to everyone. While Iran has been quite open in its calls to annihilate Israel, a nuclear-capable Iran will threaten countries far beyond its borders. The very countries which are now planning to refill Iran's coffers are the countries which will be at risk in the future. 
The Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act is not a country-wide sanction. What we are proposing here is intended to sanction specific entities known to be providing Iran with missile technology. This bill is an effort to stem this dangerous flow to Iran and is designed to impose certain sanctions on foreign persons who transfer items contributing to Iran's efforts to acquire, develop, or produce ballistic missiles. 
There is good intelligence about which Russian entities are involved. Some of them are involved in joint space cooperation with the United States. These companies should know that there will be costs if they engage in behavior which so obviously threatens our security interests, the security interests of the region, and the security interests of the entire world, from the leading sponsor of terrorism around the world, which is the Iranian regime. 
The administration claims it is making progress with the Russian Government on this matter, that we need to give them time to implement the relatively new decree tightening the export of dual-use technology. 
We keep hearing about the progress we are making with the Russians, but we do not see it. I might note as well, there were recent bills passed in the House of Representatives going at the administration in this country about the sharing of dual-use technology with China and saying that this was wrong what the administration has been supporting. 
How can we believe them that they are going to be able to stop the Russians when they are providing some of this in a questionable dual-use area to the Chinese? 
Mr. President, we do not undervalue what the Russian Government is trying to do. We are all encouraged by the progress that is being made. But the fact remains that the transfers continue. 
Just 2 weeks ago--2 weeks ago--the Government of Azerbaijan intercepted a transfer of materials going from Russia to Iran which would have significantly enhanced Iran's ability to produce missiles indigenously. 
If the Russians are working so diligently on this program, this bill poses no threats and in fact really would help them in these efforts. The bill would not sanction the Russian Government. That is a very important point to make. It does not sanction the Russian Government. 
In fact, if the Russian Government is serious about stemming the flow of this technology, this bill only helps them. After all, it is going after companies which are now breaking Russian laws. 
Mr. President, there is no reason why the U.S. taxpayer should be providing any taxpayer dollars to companies that are colluding with Iran to make that country an even greater danger to the United States, the leading country sponsoring terrorism around the world that is seeking to get this technology. 
We cannot allow this river of technology and assistance without doing everything possible to stop it. This bill works towards that goal. I encourage my colleagues to vote for it. I encourage the administration to sign it and to help us stop the flow of this technology to the leading terrorist regime around the world that seeks to get these weapons that can strike at U.S. interests. This bill is clearly in the United States' best interests. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the Senator from Arizona for yielding time to me.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding me 5 minutes. I want to stand up and speak on behalf of Grandma Gramm, that her money not go to lawyers as well. 
Mr. President, I have been following this debate back in the office. I followed it for some period of time. I serve on the Commerce Committee. I initiated this debate in the Commerce Committee and discussed it there. It seems as if the points have been pretty well made, pretty significantly made and repeated in the true tradition of the Senate about five times, so we all get it pretty clearly. 
One thing that I want to point out, though, at this juncture, because the debate has been engaging, is whether or not the Senate should set legal fees, whether we should get involved in this. And I generally, as a principle, would say no, we should not, but the fact is, in this bill we already are setting legal fees. We are setting them in this bill. And so to the extent that we are going to set them, I think the only question for us to ask ourselves is how much. 
Should it be nearly $100,000 an hour or should it be $250 an hour? As to the question of whether or not we are setting legal fees, they are being set in this bill. In this bill, we are providing the money. We are setting in place the mechanism to give this money to the trial lawyers. 
That is happening. I don't care how you cut it. That is what happens if this bill passes. If this bill doesn't pass, that doesn't happen. We are setting the amount the lawyers are going to get. The only question that remains is how much per hour is good compensation. 
Now, I understand the good Senator from South Carolina. He and I debated this in the Commerce Committee. He thinks they are entitled to whatever they can get because they were the ones willing to put forward this litigation. They were the ones willing to put themselves on the line. They were the ones willing to say, I am going to go out here, and I may not get a dime or I may hit the jackpot. I hit the jackpot. 
So they are entitled to get that. I understand that. But I can't vote for that. I can't in the Senate say I am going to tax the people so that we can transfer $100,000 per hour in legal fees. 
I think Grandma Gramm would say $250 an hour is too much, too, but it is a lot closer and a lot better than $100,000 per hour. And this bill sets those legal fees. No matter how you cut it, it puts the money in place to set those legal fees. Without this bill, that money doesn't go. With this bill, that money does go to lawyers. So it is only a question of how much. I just ask my colleagues to look at it. Which is the more appropriate figure, $100,000 an hour or $250 an hour? 
With that, everything having been said four or five times, I yield back the remainder of my time to the manager of the bill.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Michigan yielding time to me to speak on this very important amendment. I have been listening to the earlier debate about the ability of U.S. workers to get these jobs versus workers coming in from overseas. I think the critical point that maybe is not being clearly put forward on this is what we are talking about here is being able to keep U.S. businesses in the United States, and, thus, access to these jobs dominantly by--indeed, in many cases exclusively--by U.S. workers. We are trying to keep the businesses here. Many of these businesses could easily and rapidly move overseas, particularly ones in developing computer software and programming. That is something they could rapidly and easily move overseas. We want those jobs here so our workers have access to them. 
What we are talking about in the amendment put forward by the Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, is a present crunch that we have getting some workers into some of these jobs. This seriously needed legislation will raise the visa cap for professional workers from the present maximum of 65,000 to an additional 30,000 visas for 1998 with a 5-year sunset for additional H-1B visas. A failure to act would be a blow to many American companies, which are striving to obtain these workers at this immediate need and juncture in a very highly competitive marketplace. Without the visa increase, they will be denied the ability to secure workers central to their immediate needs. 
I agree, we need to offer benefits and help more and make sure that U.S. workers have the greatest access, and they should. What we have is an immediate problem, and we don't want these businesses moving overseas. The legislation seeks to address this problem. 
There is an immediate, severe, technical worker shortage in America which can only be met by this legislation. It is reported by the INS that by early May the present cap of 65,000 will have already been reached--already reached. This means that American businesses will be entirely foreclosed for over half a year from obtaining some of the highly skilled professional workers that they need under this option for immediate need--immediate work and immediate help--rather than moving these businesses overseas to be able to access those workers. 
This legislation will help to maintain America's competitive edge in the global marketplace. It will encourage--not hurt--American business growth and, thus, job creation in the United States, which is presently at an extraordinarily high level. It will enable technical businesses to retain the workers required to develop their products in a highly competitive market. It will empower companies to maintain timely production schedules. 
Companies from throughout the country say that they must have this additional ability to hire needed workers to be able to remain in the United States. This is especially true for high-tech industries across America which specialize in computer-related products. This industry is extremely time sensitive, requiring speedy product development and production. For example, computer software is frequently developed in 6-month cycles. Failing to deliver within these time frames because of technical worker shortages can severely compromise a company's competitive edge. One observer of the current system said: 
Critical projects will be abandoned or put on hold--at the cost of many more American jobs. This can be disastrous for our industries with short product cycles that are trying to compete against fierce global competitors. 
Who supports the legislation? Businesses, universities and ethnic organizations, all back this effort, as well as workers concerned that their companies might be forced to move offshore. 
Speaking of that subject, the New York Times recently wrote this: 
If U.S. companies are told to put up `No Vacancy' signs, they are inevitably going to move more operations overseas, and that will spur more innovation, wealth creation, and jobs over there. By contrast, this legislation helps to encourage companies to stay within American shores and keep jobs here in America, and growth taking place here in America. 
At this time of economic growth, our Government must be sensitive to respond to needs as they arise in the marketplace. This legislation is a sensible response to a legitimate problem, and represents that American Government is a partner to encouraging, not discouraging, growth, job creation, retention of jobs, and prosperity in America. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and commend Senator Abraham for sponsoring this important legislation, needed for American jobs to be able to stay in America. I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield the time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Feinstein amendment. Senator Feinstein and I spoke yesterday about this issue and the need to speak and to act quickly by the United States in a statement of condemnation towards India, of support towards Pakistan, to encourage the Pakistanis to stand strong as a nation and not to ignite and set forth a nuclear weapon and escalate this chain reaction. We put forward this resolution of which I am a cosponsor. I believe it is the right and appropriate step for us. She has offered it, and she has been a peacemaker and a peacekeeper for these countries, had their representatives in her home to try to get the Ambassadors of these two nations to speak together and to not further proliferate but, rather, to seek peace. And all of that to no avail as far as the action that the Indian Government has taken this week. 
We had, yesterday, a hearing in my subcommittee that Senator Feinstein attended where we heard of the great problems we are facing on this entire subcontinent. 
Indeed, this is probably the most difficult area of the world today and the most problematic, and the most probable flash point that the world is facing today with the use of nuclear weapons. 
With the Indians taking this action, five being set off, and then the response in India, not being one of `My goodness, what have we unleashed, these first devices being set off since 1974 by a nonnuclear-weapons state; my gosh, what have we released?' the reaction in the street has been jubilation, which is greater cause for concern, for concern of what is going to happen in Pakistan, which is most likely the next place for there to be a response, whether they would step forward and set off a nuclear weapon themselves, and where do we escalate from there? These two nations have gone to war three times in the last half century. This, to me, is a grave situation we are facing today. 
The world was duly horrified this week when the Government of India detonated these three nuclear devices. I think India has behaved irresponsibly and has relegated itself to the category of an outcast. It is a terrible shame for a great nation. Rather than a celebration in the streets, the people of India should be demonstrating against their government for plunging their nation into this international crisis. That is why I support this resolution. 
South Asia is facing a moment of truth. India has already acted. We know Pakistan is poised to retaliate. I believe we have to have a chance--and I want to note this, just a chance--to stop Pakistan, or encourage Pakistan from taking a foolish and dangerous step. We must, as President Clinton has recognized, do all we can to persuade the Government of Pakistan to show restraint, moderation, and intelligence. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott, Assistant Secretary Inderfurth and General Zinni are in Pakistan right now. I support their efforts and wish them every success in their discussions with Prime Minister Sharif. 
But I think we, too, must act in the U.S. Senate. With this resolution, I think we must demonstrate, also, our support for Prime Minister Sharif in the face of incredible pressure that he is going to have from his country to respond to India's nuclear tests. That is why I believe the Senate should do this, and I also think the Senate should go further. I think we need to take further and even more aggressive and bold action to try to encourage the Pakistanis: Don't respond in kind. 
With that, I think we need to act today to repeal the Pressler amendment as an action we can take, as an overt carrot to hold out to the Pakistanis, saying, `We believe in your cause. Please, show restraint. Don't go on forward. Don't ignite a nuclear weapon. Don't continue this chain reaction. And if you don't, we are prepared to move forward with removing something that has been a thorn in your side for some time, the Pressler amendment itself.' 
This is not about rewarding Pakistan or punishing India. This is a signal to Pakistan at a crucial moment. Repealing the Pressler amendment will have little impact on the ground. Pakistan is already subject to Glenn-Symington sanctions dating back more than a decade. Those sanctions already preclude providing Pakistan any assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act. 
So, in this regard I would like to send an amendment to the desk regarding the Pressler amendment and ask for its immediate consideration. This will be in the form of an amendment to the amendment.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as I pointed out, I am a cosponsor of Senator Feinstein's efforts in this regard, the resolution being put forward. I think that is positive and it is a right step to do. I think we need to do that. But I think at this critical juncture we have to act even more decisively than what we are doing with this resolution, and that is why I am proposing this amendment to the resolution that I cosponsor. I think the amendment that Senator Feinstein has put forward is the right thing to do. 
I think, as well, at this very moment in Islamabad and throughout Pakistan they are considering: How do we respond? What do we do? Should we set off a nuclear weapon ourselves, in this escalating set of events? 
If you are in Islambad and you are the Prime Minister of this country, or a parliamentarian, or somebody that's an official in this nation, you have to be sitting there saying, What do we do? Is this the time we should show strength in the form of retaliation, in the form of setting off another nuclear weapon, and we get the escalation going on? And there is pressure building in the streets, and the people in the streets say, `We need to respond, we need to show strength in the form of detonating a nuclear weapon.' 
We have to do everything we can today to try to encourage the Pakistanis not to respond in kind. We need to hold out some carrots to them, saying if you will show restraint, if you will show wisdom, if you will show moderation, we can help and we can work with you and here is a way. The Pressler amendment has been in place. It has been partially repealed over time. We can say to them, If you will show restraint, we are going to move towards lifting this; we are going to lift this Pressler amendment. 
Then they have a different choice to make. They can say, You know, if we don't respond in kind we can get the onus of this off our back that we have tried to have removed for some time. If we do respond in kind, the Glenn amendment automatically hits the Pakistanis as well, and you are going to have a wider range of issues and of sanctions that will be hitting Pakistan. So now there is a carrot and a big stick sitting out there of, How do we respond? And the pressure is building in the streets in Islamabad and throughout Pakistan of, How do we respond? We have to do everything we can, near term, to stop that and provide them some option and some means and some reason not to set off a nuclear weapon. 
What repealing this outdated, I think, unilateral sanction will do is bring Pakistan on the same playing field as the rest of the world and will offer them a carrot. If Pakistan detonates a nuclear weapon, as India has, it will be subject to the same sanctions as India. And believe me, I will be the first one to urge that the United States move swiftly and decisively to impose the sanctions. 
It is important that we factor in several considerations as we consider this amendment. The first is that there are multiple laws in place to deal with nuclear proliferators: the Glenn-Symington amendment, the Glenn amendment, and various others. Pakistan will not, and should not, be allowed to get away with nuclear proliferation. There can be no excuse for transgressing international norms or U.S. laws. 
However, we must also face an important reality. Pakistan, a long-term friend and ally of the United States, is next door to a nation of 960 million people who just tested five nuclear weapons this week. India could not have been more clear that it was sending a message to China and as well to Pakistan and the rest of the world. It is not unnatural, though it is clearly unwise, for Pakistan to consider its options. 
Pakistan's conventional military abilities have been seriously eroded because of the Pressler sanctions. I believe that were Pakistan able to be more reliant on a conventional deterrent the nuclear option might seem less attractive. In addition, were Pakistan aware of the immense international support behind a policy 
of restraint, so, too, might they feel less threatened and feel like there is something in this for them if they show a bit of moderation and a bit of restraint. 
We are at a crucial moment. Failure to take decisive action at this juncture could mean disaster in south Asia. I think time is absolutely of the essence or I would not have brought it out on this today. Decisions are being made now in Islamabad of what reaction they will take to the Indian's action, what they have done this week in detonating five nuclear weapons. Those decisions are being made now. I wish we could put this debate off for a month or 2 or 5 months, or a year, but it is now that it counts. It is now that decisions are being made. I hate to rush people towards these sorts of actions, but if we fail to act now, with all the potential we have to urge restraint in Pakistan, I am fearful we will have acted too late and the graphite rods will have been pulled out and the chain reaction continues and we have not done everything we possibly can. 
This is something we can possibly do. I wish it were in another place on another vehicle. There is no other place or time to be able to do this. I think the base amendment is a good one to pass. I think this one sends the absolute positive signal to Pakistan, please, please show restraint. That is why I ask consideration of my amendment to the amendment. 
At the appropriate time, if necessary, I will be asking for the yeas and nays.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, particularly in light of the 1996 Farm Bill, it is important that the federal government focus its attention on the factors that will increase U.S. agriculture's competitiveness in a deregulated farm economy. This includes improving efficiency in the transportation system, keeping international markets active and growing, advancing research, and facilitating use of market oriented risk management tools. 
Yesterday the Senate approved the Conference Report to S. 1150, which provides for two of those critical factors. First of all, it provides important funding for agriculture research programs. Though I am critical of government funding of applied research that would otherwise be financed by those who will directly benefit in the private sector, I view basic research as a responsibility of the federal government. It is through research--largely conducted by the land grant universities supported by the federal government--that we experienced the `green revolution' whereby the world learned to produce more food using fewer resources. Through research we have developed technologies that have increased farm efficiency exponentially, transformed food processing, and enhanced human nutrition. Given the structure of the agriculture industry, these advances never would have occurred if it had been up to individual farmers or individual companies to conduct the necessary research. 
Furthermore, the intensive use of farmland here in the U.S. means that sensitive ecosystems around the world--which would have to be converted to farmland were it not for the productive capacity of the Midwest--can be spared. Continuing to search for ways to increase the productive capacity of America's farmers will help ensure that these ecosystems are not destroyed in order to provide for the food needs of the world's growing population. So the advances achieved through research have not only improved our own economic position, they have also benefitted the environment worldwide. 
The bill also provides a stable funding mechanism for crop insurance, which has been subject to annual debates in recent years. This has been problematic for farmers and insurance agents, who need to be able to plan ahead. With the more liberalized market conditions that the new Freedom to Farm Act provides, risk management is more important than ever for farmers. And, for many, crop insurance is the most viable option for managing risk. In fact, lenders often require that producers obtain crop insurance in order to qualify for operating loans. 
All of the spending that is directed toward these programs is offset by savings from food stamp administration accounts and the limitation of Commodity Credit Corporation funding for computers. So, the increased spending in this bill does not jeopardize the balanced budget agreement enacted last year. 
It goes without saying that this bill is critical for a farm state like Kansas. However, the benefits of agricultural research and a reliable mechanism to manage risk extend well beyond the state lines of farm states--this country's production affords our consumers in rural communities and cities alike the cheapest, safest, and most abundant food supply on earth. It is imperative that Congress continue the investment that makes this competitive advantage possible. I am glad that the Senate finally approved the Conference Report, and hope that the House will act soon to secure these benefits for rural America.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Senator Harkin from Iowa recently spoke on the floor about the terrible occurrence recently happening in India, the explosion of three nuclear devices, which has been roundly condemned around the world. It is very destabilizing in the Indian subcontinent and is going to trigger a set of automatic sanctions. 
In the Foreign Relations Committee, at 2 p.m. tomorrow afternoon, we will be holding a hearing about the actions taken by the Indian Government, its consequences on the U.S.-Indian relationship, and its consequences throughout that subcontinent. I certainly invite all the Members of the U.S. Senate and others interested to watch these hearings and to follow those, because this is a significant event that has occurred. It has significant ramifications on U.S.-India relationships and is an action that is happening in one of the most volatile regions of the world. 
I think we all advise and advocate strongly, for our allies and other friends of ours in the neighborhood, for there to be a calm, stable response to this and that there not be further testing to take place. We will explore these issues in the Foreign Relations Committee tomorrow at 2 o'clock. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to note my support for the resolution of my colleague from California. I think this is an important, quick statement for us to be making to the Government of India and to the nations in the region, both Pakistan and China in particular. The nuclear test that took place yesterday will have a tremendously destabilizing impact in the region. It was a bad move on the part of the Government of India. I think this is something the U.S. Senate needs to speak out on clearly and quickly, to state our displeasure, and that this will have consequences to it. I urge the administration to put forward the sanctions that are called for in the Glenn amendment. I don't think we can stand by and tolerate the sort of actions that have taken place. I urge my colleagues to look at this resolution, to sign on. Hopefully, we can pass this in an expedited fashion.

Mr. BROWNBACK. What a stirring speech from the Senator from West Virginia on such a fitting time and occasion, on Mother's Day. I just did my note to my mother this morning for Mother's Day. I sent a poem--not orally delivered; I think orally is much better than in writing. 
As you reflect and talk of the essence of motherhood, it seems it is the essence of love you are talking about. It reminds me of what we are called to do. We are called to love--to love our Lord, our God, with all our heart, mind, soul, and flesh, and to love our neighbor as ourselves. Mothers seem to exemplify that perhaps better than anybody does. 
How fitting, on National Day of Prayer, when we are praying for our Nation, why not add a prayer for your mother, too, and pray for the mothers of the country who rock the cradle, who lead us in many places, in many facets. 
I can see my own wife, today, with our three children, leading them and leading us and leading our family--that central unit of the Republic, the family. 
I am very touched by the Senator's speech.

<TEXT>
Mr. BROWNBACK. I am afraid, Mr. President, my speech is far more pedestrian. It is about taxes. When you think of it in the context next to motherhood, it pales substantially, yet it is the business of this body. 
The bill we are on today is about taxes, and it is about reforming the IRS. I think the chairman of the Finance Committee has done extraordinary work on bringing this topic to the floor, and I am going to support it. I think it is an important measure to us and for the Republic. 
I rise to speak for a few minutes on the need not only to reform the Internal Revenue Service but to change the way our Government is financed. During consideration of the budget resolution, just a short month ago, the Senate voted not only for the need to make some basic changes in the IRS but also the need to sunset the Tax Code. 
It is a sad and easily recognizable fact that big government advocates have socially engineered our culture into the ground through the use--and abuse, I might add--of the power to tax. To save our culture, we must at once not only recognize and support those entities in the culture that help us, but also remove the ability of Government to discriminate against institutions that help us, as well. For instance, the marriage penalty; we have a tax on being married. If you are married, you get taxed more than if you just live together. That is wrong. That is harmful to society. It is harmful to the culture and needs to be removed. We promote, also, gambling in the Tax Code. 
In short, we must cut back on Government's micromanagement of our lives, and particularly those areas that create vice and hinder and hurt our Republic and our Nation and our culture. This is a Tax Code that we have today that will go down in history as one of the most onerous burdens ever placed on the American people. I am convinced that we cannot have another American century with this Tax Code. It is antifamily. It is antigrowth. It cannot be saved. It must be scrapped. 
But in the meantime, we must try to correct for some of the well documented cases of abuses that were given life by this Tax Code and were brought to light by the Senate Finance Committee. The IRS needs to be reformed as much as the code that has given it unprecedented power needs to be put to rest. Americans demand reform of our Tax Code as well as the agency charged with enforcing it. We have promised that reform. Now, during the course of this bill, we must begin to deliver on that promise to the American people. 
I believe we need to stay focused on where the problem really lies. 
In order to make this point, I have a horror story from Kansas--not that everybody doesn't have one from their home State, actually many of them coming forward--that involves an older couple--the husband is nearly 70 years old--running a small business from their home. In the mid-1980s, they were selected for an IRS audit that focused heavily on home office deductions and related expenses and resulted in the assessment of additional taxes, penalties, and interest. The constituents have made payments on the back taxes, but in so doing, they limited their ability to make their current estimated tax payments. So the IRS said, `Stop making your back tax payments 
and let's get caught up on your current estimated taxes.' The constituents told them they would do that. But they were told, as well, that the IRS would put a hold on the collection of their back taxes until they were caught up on their current estimated taxes. The IRS said, `OK, we will put a hold on collecting your back taxes. You get caught up on the estimated current taxes.' However, the IRS failed to inform the constituents that interest on the back taxes would continue to accrue. 
Now, the outstanding principal balance my constituents owed was $18,000. However, when the penalty and accrued interest are added, the amount balloons to $46,000--from an $18,000 back tax to $46,000 in interest and penalties. My constituents have offered to pay $18,000. They believe that they might be able to come up with that with loans from friends and relatives. However, the IRS cites the constituents' equity in their home as a source of income that could be used to settle the entire debt, but they need to sell their home or otherwise refinance in order to be able to get the equity to pay off this bad tax debt. 
Unfortunately, because of the situation with the IRS, the IRS has put a lien on their home. And, in fact, in this era of declining interest rates, my constituents have been forced to pay over 10 percent interest rates because the lien precludes them from refinancing at lower rates, possibly as low as 7 percent. Therefore, again, my constituents are making very high house payments, which squeezes their budget even tighter, which limits their ability to pay their back taxes and interest due to the IRS or the current estimated taxes due to the IRS. 
If my constituents were to sell their home, their age would likely preclude them from generating enough income to purchase another home. The IRS has even garnished their Social Security retirement income. Social Security benefits comprise the bulk of their income. They are still trying to reach a settlement with the IRS. In trying as hard as they can to make this payment, they are getting squeezed and boxed in by this IRS and by this code. This is just another horrible example of the IRS in the Catch-22 situation that is forced upon many Americans. It must be put to a stop. This cannot continue. 
The underlying problem, though, along with the IRS enforcement, is the Tax Code. Not only does our Tax Code undermine the basic building blocks of our society, the family, it also punishes good investment decisions and distorts the labor market as well as our rates of national savings are distorted by this Tax Code. It manipulates behavior by adding an incentive to do one thing while punishing those who would do something else. 
A quick look at some of the inadequacies in our code should make the case for reform clear. For example, if you are a gambler, you can deduct your gambling losses against your winnings. But if you are a homeowner and you happen to make a bad home investment, and the value of your home declines, you have no recourse in the Tax Code because you cannot claim a deduction for the capital loss. Now the question really is--think about this--should we allow for a bad game of blackjack to be deducted but not a bad home investment which you were building a family around? Does this make sense to anybody? I don't think so. 
The code is full of these inconsistencies, like the one I just mentioned. Sure, we can try to fix the problems within our Tax Code, and we should, but the fact of the matter is, our Tax Code is riddled with these inconsistencies. It is micromanagement to the greatest degree, 
which leads to the conclusion that we cannot reform this code. We have to sunset it and go to one that is simpler, better, and fairer. We must move to a tax system where individuals are not punished for getting married, for saving for their children's education, or for other investments, where the national rate of savings is not distorted by these unintended consequences. This current Tax Code doesn't make sense. It is unintelligible. It has 10 million words and it has to be gotten rid of. 
We should go to a tax system that does not discriminate against the components of growth in our economy or the family. Some will disagree. But this is the precise issue upon which we must focus our debate. We must decide where we want the tax to be imposed; and further, we must understand what effect the imposition of the tax will have on the health of the economy. We need to go to a progrowth, profamily taxation system. 
Mr. President, we are soon going to have a debate on replacing this Tax Code. I have spoken with the majority leader and he agrees with the need to bring this up during the Treasury-Postal debate. We will have a full debate about replacing and sunsetting this Tax Code and going to one that is simpler, fairer, and better. 
It is time to have this debate. We voted previously in the Senate on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to sunset this Tax Code by the end of the year 2001 and start the great national debate now about what we should replace this riddled code with. That is what we should do--figure out what we are going to replace it with and set the time line that by this date we will have a new code. It may take 15 years to implement it. We are going to have to do some phasing in doing it. But it is time to start the great debate on this. Reform is important. Reforming the IRS is critical. The next step is reforming the IRS code, the law. We will vote on sunsetting it and start this great national debate of going to a different system so that we can have another American century, an unlimited America. We can't with this code. We can and we must do better. 
With that, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to work with the distinguished Senator from Kansas, who is presiding today, and also the distinguished Senator from Indiana, who has put forth this new alliance. It is a cadre of members who are putting forth these points that we think have not been sufficiently debated nor brought forward in the overall debate in America about what we should do about the crying issues of poverty that has so hit and harmed our Nation in so many places, both urban and rural. 
More than 30 years after the United States first declared the War on Poverty, most signs point to failure. The United States has spent hundreds of billions of dollars--by some accounts we have spent nearly $4 trillion--to fight poverty only to find poverty in America has grown more widespread, more entrenched, and more pathological. The solution is not to expand more Government but rather to go a different way, and to say, `Look, we have tried that route. We have spent nearly $4 trillion trying that route. We have tried every program you possibly can with that route. Maybe there is another way that we should be going.' 
This is what the Renewal Alliance, this program, is about--about rewarding self-help and not Government help. It is about encouraging charity rather than encouraging Government. It is about encouraging volunteerism rather than putting more people on the taxpayer rolls to solve problems that we have failed to be able to solve. Family breakdown, crime, poor education performance, and a lack of opportunity in the inner cities, and many other areas, including many rural areas, are now national problems. But many of the solutions are to be found on a local level and not in Washington, through personal contacts that people can make between individuals and the dedicated involvement of families, churches, schools, and neighborhood associations. These small groups, not big Government, but rather small groups, often referred to as the `little platoons' in a civil society, can often accomplish what no Government program could dream of or ever been able to do. They have the soft hearts and the willing hands to be able to reach out and touch people directly in a community where they 
are in there with the families working with them. 
Last December, I had the chance to visit several of these small, private charities in my home State of Kansas. To me, they are living proof of the amazing effectiveness of small, local charities that lead with heart, that lead with love. 
Mr. President, in this very body, in this very room, as you enter into the main doorway coming in here, there is a sign above the door mantle which reads `In God We Trust.' As I visited these small charities in Kansas, I was reminded at that time and was thinking about how many people say that versus how many people do that. These are charities, which `In God We Trust' they live every day. 
I visited Good Samaritan Clinic in Wichita, which serves around 300 patients a month from Wichita's poorest neighborhood. This tiny clinic operates on less than a shoestring budget. With the exception of a fax machine and one piece of furniture, everything in the clinic is donated. The clinic's staff, a dedicated and accomplished group of doctors, are mostly volunteers. They are reaching out and touching people, and helping and healing people with their skills and with their hearts. 
I visited the Topeka Rescue Mission and the Union Rescue Mission of Wichita, both of which serve thousands of people each year. 
These missions are not merely assigning people to bunks, but they challenge them personally and spiritually, and they are challenged to change their hearts and their souls along with helping them out in their lives. 
I visited the Crisis Pregnancy Outreach Program in Topeka and a maternity home in Wichita and saw firsthand the love and personal attention devoted to each woman who passes through those doors. 
Contrast that with the large Government solution that we have tried for the past 30 years that gets millions of people flowing through the door but constantly keeps them flowing back out the door and never really changes things in a person's life, continues to hand them something but doesn't put arms around them and hug them, doesn't put arms around them and give them heart and soul and say, `Here is my phone number; call anytime.' 
It is not that we don't have a lot of good and dedicated servants; we do, but they are limited in what they can do. This is a mission for them. They must not see the number of people who are walking through; they must see a soul at a time. They must see another and another, to reach out and touch and help them. We need to encourage these groups and not discourage them. 
As the past 35 years of our history has shown, the Federal Government is limited in its capacity to solve the problems of poverty and pathology, But it can eliminate perverse incentives that reward irresponsibility and fuel the flight of capital from the inner cities, and it can encourage entrepreneurialism, charitable giving and investment in the inner cities and its inhabitants, investment in the inhabitants of those areas and rural areas as well. It can do these things and it should. And through the renewal alliance REAL Life legislation, it will. 
That is why I am delighted to be associated with the Senator from Indiana in this package that we have put forward. It is a different way. It is a way that people every day are proving can and is working, and we need to encourage it and lift it up and move it forward. I am delighted to be a part of this legislation.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I was unable to vote on Senate Concurrent Resolution 90, which acknowledges the historic Northern Ireland Peace Agreement. Had I been present I would have voted in favor of the resolution. I request that the official record so indicate. 
Mr. President, Ireland has suffered thirty years of turmoil, a tragic set of circumstances which has taken a deep toll on the Irish people. This toll can be measured in the loss of thousands of lives, and the instability which arises from thirty years of constant fighting, and terror. Despite the best efforts of the governments of the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom over the years to find an equitable solution, these, until recently were to no avail. 
Mr. President, finally I would note that the symbolism of this accord being reached on Good Friday should not escape us. It has been said that Good Friday is the vortex to which all history is drawn, and out of which all history flows, forever transformed. Let us hope that this momentous accord will set Ireland on a course towards peace and prosperity from which there is no turning back.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of independence of Sri Lanka. I believe it is appropriate that we so mark this occasion by offering our congratulations to her excellency, President Kumaratunga and the people of Sri Lanka. 
In the five decades since Sri Lanka gained its independence from British colonial rule, Sri Lanka has held regular national elections as well as provincial and local government elections. The most recent parliamentary elections were held in August 1994, and the third presidential election was held in November 1994. 
Sri Lanka has prospered economically since 1977, when it introduced economic liberalization policies which shifted the economy away from state controls, subsidies and public sector involvement to a market-oriented system in which private entrepreneurship flourishes. The U.S. is Sri Lanka's largest trading partner, accounting for 30% of the latter's exports, and over 90 U.S. companies have invested in Sri Lanka, with a heavy concentration in mining and textiles. 
U.S. official relations with Sri Lanka date back to 1850 when John Black, an American merchant residing in Colombo was appointed the first American commercial agent in Galle. Fifty years later the agency moved to Colombo and became a consulate. It subsequently became an embassy in 1948 after Sri Lanka became independent. 
The exchange of bilateral visits has played an important role in strengthening the cordial relations between our two nations. Then Secretary of State John Foster Dulles visited Sri Lanka soon after its independence, and since that time members of this body as well as our colleagues in the House have regularly visited this lovely country. 
Despite its prosperity and commitment to democratic principles, Sri Lanka has been plagued for many years by two domestic insurgencies, one mainly Tamil in the North, and the other mainly Sinhalese, in the South. The result has been the loss of many lives and heavy damage to property. The government has reiterated its commitment to addressing grievances articulated by these groups through dialog and the process of negotiation. Four rounds of unconditional talks with the Tamil Tiger separatists were held following the President's election in November 1994, and a cease fire was subsequently reached. This however, was breached by the separatists after 3 1/2 months when they resumed their terrorist activity. 
As a result of these terrorist actions at home, Sri Lanka has placed counter terrorism at the forefront of its foreign policy. Sri Lanka was the Vice Chair of the United Nations Ad hoc Committee on Terrorism and played an important role in the drafting of the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing, being the first to sign the Convention at United Nations Headquarters on January 12, 1998. 
I am therefore, Mr. President, pleased to acknowledge this occasion by expressing best wishes to the Government and people of Sri Lanka as they celebrate 50 years of independence. I know that we all look forward to continued cooperation and friendship with the Government and people of Sri Lanka in the years ahead.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues Senator Coverdell and Senator Ashcroft in introducing legislation that would prohibit the use of federal funds for any program that gives out hypodermic needles or syringes for use with illegal drugs. 
Mr. President, last Friday, the Clinton Administration announced their intention to use federal funds to distribute free drug needles. Although they abruptly reversed course this week, they have maintained their intention of encouraging state and local governments and other institutions to distribute drug needles. 
This is bad policy, bad science, and bad news for our country. A comprehensive study of the needle exchange program in Vancouver, British Columbia--the city with the world's largest needle give-away program--found that drug use, crime, and HIV transmission all increased where drug needles were handed out. 
This should come as no surprise. One of the primary principles of economics is that you get more of what you subsidize and less of what you tax. You do not discourage drug use by giving out free needles. You cannot reduce disease by encouraging addiction. 
More than ever before, we need strong leadership in the war on drugs, and a clear message that drugs are wrong, and harmful. Consider the facts: Over the past three years, casual drug us among teens has almost doubled. A survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that the proportion of eighth graders who had tried heroin had doubled between 1991 and 1996. Every year, there are thousands of young people who fall prey to drugs. We need to send the clear message that using drugs is illegal and wrong. Drug use must be stopped, not subsidized. 
That is why I am proud to stand with Senators Coverdell and Ashcroft in introducing legislation that to prohibit spending taxpayer dollars on drug needle give-aways, and urge my colleagues to expedite passage of this legislation.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I was moved to find that more than 800 members of the D.C. community gathered together yesterday to pray for the District's public schools. The Rhema Christian Center Church invited people of all faiths to join them and pray for 25 school improvements which ranged from increased parental involvement to better safety. 
They call themselves prayer warriors. They were each assigned to one of the District's 146 schools for the `Jesus Goes to School Day of Prayer.' As the children of D.C. walked into school--outside the prayer warriors prayed. 
Many of these children walk through dangerous neighborhoods--where drug deals and violence are common--on their way to school every day. These children begin their school day with negative images. Yesterday, however, was different. Yesterday, the children of D.C. began their school day with a strong, positive message of prayer and support from their community. 
The prayer warriors said `We have tried everything else as a nation to save public education. Now, let's try prayer.' Mr. President, we should recognize and affirm the example these prayer warriors have set in the nation's Capitol.

Mr. BROWNBACK. The Brownback amendment is a simple amendment that calls for a change in the budget law, the pay-go rules of the budget law, to allow for discretionary spending program eliminations, all those key words, to be used for tax cuts or to save Social Security. It allows for that usage to be able to do those things. 
Now, according to current budget law--and I realize some of this can be arcane to a number of people--we cannot make cuts in discretionary spending programs in order to finance tax cuts. You have to make cuts in mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare to pay for tax cuts. That is just not fair and it is not right and it is wrong. 
That is why we put forward this amendment. At this time I will read the amendment because it is short, sweet, and to the point and it is important. 
It is the sense-of-the-Senate that the functional tools underlying this resolution assume that--

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to respond to a few of the statements. I think the Senator from New Jersey, whom I appreciate, and I appreciate his service in the U.S. Senate, probably made the exact accurate point. That is, if you are going to cut veterans programs for tax cuts, people will come unglued, and it will not happen, because there will be a number of veterans out there saying, `What are you doing cutting veterans programs and paying for tax cuts? I am not going to let you do that.' And that would work. 
If we went out and said, you know what, we are going to eliminate tobacco subsidies to pay for tax cuts, or we are going 
to cut the corporate welfare for the wealthiest 50 corporations in America and pay for a tax cut with that, would people come unglued? I sense an applause line in Kansas for something like that. 
If I go to Kansas and say, `I am going to cut veterans programs and write tax cuts,' they will say, `We are going to give you your head for that one.' That is the whole point here. The system is currently tilted toward no tax cuts and growing Government, because if you are going to provide for a tax cut, you have to cut Social Security or Medicare basically to pay for that tax cut. That is wrong. We should not be cutting Social Security and Medicare. We should not be cutting them at all, let alone offset them against a tax cut. The system was set up exactly this way to build Government and make it bigger. 
Why are we at $1.7 trillion and growing? It is because the system is built to build. Why do we still subsidize tobacco? This makes absolutely no sense. So what we are trying to do here is make a little change. 
The Senator from New Jersey raises another very important point about permanent savings paying for permanent tax cuts. I think that is a valuable issue to raise. That is why, in the measure, we state that you have to eliminate the program--not just cut it back, but eliminate the program to pay for tax cuts. 
So let's take my example again. If we go to tobacco subsidies and say we are going to eliminate tobacco subsidies and pay for this tax cut, it will be a small tax cut. What about the next two then? Do you think they are going to be able to add back in tobacco subsidies once you get it finally pulled out by its roots? I don't think so. What if you are able to pull out corporate welfare by its roots to pay for that tax cut? Are we going to be able, the next year, to add back in that corporate welfare? I don't think so, once it is pulled out. There is such a system of inertia to build the bill that I think we are going to be able to get at this with this little change in the budget rules. 
This is exactly the time to be doing this, as we will be looking forward to the future as to how we are going to protect, preserve, and save Social Security. We need to do that. What are we going to do to further tax cuts on this burdensome level of taxation that we have for the American people? This little budgetary change will actually help us make some sense and sanity out of this place to a lot of the American public. 
So that is why I am putting this forward. Suggestions can be put forward by Members of Congress and by the Finance Committee on how you do it. That is the same way we do tax cuts right now--from Members, from people from the Finance Committee. 
This is a good provision. If you asked the American people about this, they will say that is the way the place ought to work, instead of this arcane way that we have set it up that actually hurts the American public and maintains wasteful programs. That is why I am going to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this measure. 
Mr. President, I retain the balance of my time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could respond to some of the comments of my colleague from New Jersey, for whom I have a great deal of respect. He makes the exact point I am making. Tobacco subsidies aren't cut because North Carolina and Kentucky and a few other States protect those basically. Everybody else says, `Look, if you cut it, we are really not going to do it. We are not cutting taxes. We are not cutting spending.' 
So, all right, I will go along on it. We are trying to create competitors. If somebody comes up with a good idea, a program, and a need, we are going to fund it. We have proven throughout history that we will fund that. That is why actually today there is nothing so permanent as a temporary Government program. That is one of President Reagan's lines. Because we will do it. The problem is we never undo it, or we never stop doing it. We don't have any competing force back the other way. 
I think it would be a very helpful debate if we would have these regularly on the floor about, Should we actually be spending this money on corporate welfare? What if we gave it back to the taxpayer or used it to preserve and protect Social Security? That would be a good, healthy idea, because instead of the way we do it right now, which is basically we are going to add that spending, we will never look back here at what we previously paid for over the past 60 years because there is no competing force on the other side of it. 
That is why I am suggesting this would be an excellent change for this body. It would be an excellent force that would be set up in favor of the taxpayer, in favor of good government, in favor of Social Security. 
How much time is remaining on both sides?

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for including this provision in the budget and for being a cosponsor, along with 37 other Members of the U.S. Senate, of this provision. 
I have a quiz, if I can, for the Members who are still watching. Just a simple question; a series of facts and then a question. 
Let me ask people to, if they will, go through this quiz with me of, what is 10 million words long, cost over $150 billion annually just to comply with, is unintelligible by almost every American, including those with advanced degrees, advanced law degrees, advanced tax degrees, and is the lead way Washington mismanages and micromanages our lives? What one thing is that? 
It is the Tax Code. 
The Tax Code is over 10 million words, costs over $150 billion just to comply with before anybody pays a thin dime on this Tax Code. It is unintelligible to people who are tax law experts, and is the lead way that Washington micromanages individual lives across this country. It is no wonder this is an applause line. It is because people despise this code. It has been amended and added to and jiggered with over the years and years to where it just does not make any sense. 
All the resolution says is that we should sunset the code at the end of the year 2001. We sunset many Federal programs when many Federal programs are required for reauthorization. 
I heard the arguments on the other side from my colleagues from North Dakota and Arkansas--very good men, with a great deal of integrity and honor. But we disagree on this. I have to say their arguments sound very familiar. They sound very familiar to the time when we had the debate about balancing the budget by a date certain. 
The President then was saying, `If we balance the budget by a date certain, by 7 years, it's going to throw the economy into a tailspin, it's going to do all these terrible things. You don't know how you're going to balance the budget, do you?' We said, `We know a number of ways to balance this budget. And if we don't set a date by which we're going to accomplish it, it'll never get done.' 
That is the same theory with this bill. There are a number of ways to redo the Tax Code. I am glad to hear Senator Dorgan has a proposal himself. There is a flat tax proposal, there is a consumption tax proposal, there is a VAT tax proposal. Congressman Gephardt has proposals. There are a number of them. And we will be phasing in transitions the same as phasing in on different programs we have gone to. 
But the point of it here is, if we do not start, we will never get there. If we do not start, we are going to enter the next century for long periods of time with this same Tax Code in place. Let me say to the people here who are listening, we cannot have another American century built on this Tax Code. It is so big and so intrusive that people live in fear of it. Small businesses live in fear of this Tax Code because they use so many resources to comply with it. And when they comply with it, they still do not know what they have actually done to comply with the law. 
So all we are saying by this little provision that is in the budget accord is, let us deal with this Tax Code by the end of the year 2001. It leaves alone Social Security and Medicare. Those are not touched in this. So in case people are saying that they are worried about Social Security and Medicare, it is not touched in the bill. 
We are saying, if we are ever going to get rid of this that has haunted us for so long, we have to set a date certain by which we will do it. I think it is a good provision in the budget resolution. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment so we can have another American century with a different taxation system. 
I yield to my colleague from Arkansas.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I guess the rationale of the Senator from North Dakota is we are stuck with this Tax Code forever and that is the way it will be. 
Frankly, there are a lot of different ideas floating around. I heard the Senator from North Dakota has a tax proposal, as well. 
I simply ask people looking at this, could we do any worse than this current Tax Code? If I had a stack of books here now, it would be this tall. I am a lawyer. I confess that sin. I looked at this Tax Code and it is unintelligible. We couldn't do any worse with something different.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, in listening to the debate brought forward through questions on the floor, I would like to put some factual statements into the Record. First, the budget resolution puts Social Security and Medicare first. I think people recall that the President was saying we should use any surplus to save Social Security, that this is an important program and we need to invest and protect Social Security and, therefore, we should take any surpluses and put it into Social Security. 
We agree, but we also believe that we should go one step further and say that any extra funds and resources here should be used to preserve and protect Medicare as well. Medicare is an enormously important program to the American public. I don't know how many people remember last year when we debated how to save, preserve, and protect Medicare. What is being talked about in the budget agreement is using the resources to save Medicare. Now, you can go a couple of ways here. You can say, OK, I am going to use these resources to save Medicare, this enormous program that provides health care for over 35 million Americans that have had a very difficult financial time, or you can say we are going to start a whole bunch of other programs to do this--which, by the way, we are taking care of in other parts of the agreement. The Budget Committee decided to save and use these resources to preserve and protect Medicare. Let's take care of first things first, and Medicare is one of those programs. Instead of promising to spend billions of dollars on new programs, we propose to dedicate any tobacco receipts, if there are any, to Medicare solvency. Let's protect what we have first. I think that is an important point that needs to be brought into this debate. 
Madam President, I have an amendment to offer, but before I do that I will yield to the Senator from Wyoming for a statement that he has. He has been on the floor waiting for a longer period of time than I.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, this amendment to the budget resolution being considered before us today would make it a priority for this Congress to cut taxes and to begin shoring up our teetering Social Security system. 
Madam President, before I begin I wish to commend Chairman Domenici and other Members for their excellent work on the budget committee. While I would prefer a budget that cut government spending more as well as cut taxes more; I appreciate the enormity of the task before the chairman and would like to compliment him for his leadership in this area. As well, I look forward to working with the chairman to both ensure a more fiscally responsible government as well as lower taxes for all Americans. 
Madam President, I would like to begin by making a few remarks on the size and scope of our federal government and the importance of keeping our promise with the American people by living up to the spending parameters outlined in the bipartisan budget deal reached last year between the Congress and the administration and with the American people; and also to speak on the importance of honestly addressing the need to begin reforming our Social Security system. 
It is absolutely paramount and fundamental and something we must give our attention to. 
Although many of us agree that the Federal government is too large, and too intrusive most of us seldom seem to be able to make the necessary cuts to the federal government that will actually curtail its size and curb its consumptive desires. In fact, the Administration which once declared that `the era of big government is over,' has now proposed an expansion of government programs that will have the effect of busting the bipartisan budget deal that was so difficult to get to in the first place. This is not only inconsistent but bad policy. 
In contrast, I believe that it is imperative that we live within the constraints agreed to last year during negotiations with the administration. We had a deal. We had a deal with the administration that set the limits on the size and scope of the federal government. And, we had a deal with the American people. 
Now is not the time to walk away from the principles that we outlined in our bipartisan agreement just a few months ago simply because the budget--thanks mostly to the entrepreneurial spirit of main street America--is now near balance. 
The fact of the matter is that our books aren't really balanced at all because we are continuing to allow the federal government to raid the social security trust fund in order to finance its day to day operations. If a company in the private sector tried to do that they would be shut down--and rightfully so. 
If the President is serious about saving social security then he would not continue raiding the Social Security trust fund to prop up his government programs and he would not be proposing $140 billion in new spending (which is coincidentally just a little more than expected surplus receipts to the OASDI trust fund this year), rather he would be cutting government spending and paying down the debt in anticipation of unfunded future social security obligations. But he is doing just the opposite. 
Because this administration doesn't want to lead, the Congress must. And my amendment takes the lead by prioritizing Social Security solvency and tax cuts over more government spending and budget games. 
Let's stop the nonsense. 
Americans don't want more glib talk about big government programs solving all of their problems. They don't want more empty promises. They want a less intrusive government, they want lower taxes and they deserve retirement security. 
In order to help in our efforts to cut the size of the government I am offering an amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that we should destroy the firewall between spending reductions and tax cuts; by allowing for government spending reductions to be used for either tax cuts or Social Security solvency. 
Heretofore we have had a firewall between cutting domestic discretionary programs and paying for tax cuts, saying we can't cut this to pay for tax cuts. I am saying let's have a provision such that you can eliminate discretionary spending in certain categories and that money to be used to pay for tax cuts or Social Security solvency. 
Currently, according to budget law Congress cannot make cuts in discretionary spending programs in order to finance tax cuts. Rather, Congress has to make cuts in mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare in order to pay for its tax cuts. It is wrong to pit Social Security against tax cuts. 
My amendment flips the table on this false tradeoff by pitting Social Security and tax cuts against big Government spending on the other side. Let's use the cuts in big Government spending to support Social Security and tax cuts. 
According to the current budget law every time someone wants to cut taxes they are essentially forced to propose cuts in either social security or Medicare. That just isn't right. 
Our federal government is too large, and this arcane law is part of the reason. We need to focus our efforts on cutting government spending--not increasing it. And I believe one way to help accelerate the downsizing of our massive federal bureaucracy is by allowing cuts in discretionary spending to be used for tax cuts and Social Security accounts. 
My amendment would call for a change in budget law that would allow for tax cuts to be implemented in the amount of program eliminations and for saving Social Security. So, when we eliminate a program during consideration of an appropriations measure that money would be credited to the PAYGO scorecard and reserved for tax cuts and Social Security. 
Therefore, should my amendment pass and budget law be changed, we can eliminate programs like the Advanced Technology Program, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Department of Commerce, and a whole host of other government programs while at the same time giving the taxpayers the tax relief they deserve and the retirement security they need--and we can do it without making draconian cuts to mandatory spending programs that ultimately do little to save the programs and much to simply prolong the crisis. 
With my amendment we can eliminate wasteful programs and at the same time provide the American taxpayers with a solvent Social Security System along with the tax relief that they deserve. 
That is why I am offering this amendment. We can begin to cut taxes and to reform our Social Security system by transforming the debate about Social Security from rhetoric into reality. 
We have a unique opportunity to substantively begin to reform our social security system in order to ensure long-run solvency. 
We have this opportunity in large part because for the first time in over a generation we will have a balanced budget this fiscal year. 
This presents Congress with a chance to begin making changes to the Social Security system that will both protect current benefits for retirees, and those about to retire, as well as to help preserve benefits for future generations. 
We must make use of this historic opportunity to cut more government spending and to use those cuts along with the unified budget surplus to help shore up the Social Security trust fund. 
My amendment begins the process of reforming our government by making it a priority for this Congress to cut taxes and to begin shoring up our teetering Social Security system. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to introduce to the Senate and to the United States the formation of the Religious Prisoners Congressional Task Force, which will advocate for religious prisoners suffering persecution from foreign governments. 
This bicameral, bipartisan task force was founded by Representative Joe Pitts, from Pennsylvania, who has been the leading force on this, and myself. We are also joined by Senator Joe Lieberman, from Connecticut, and Representative Tony Hall, from Ohio, on this joint task force. I would also note at the very outset that many Members are active in this work and have been for a number of years, such Members as Frank Wolf, from Virginia, who for years has advocated for those who have no voice, who are prisoners of conscience in dirty cells and jails around the world; people like Senator Lugar in this body, who has done so quietly and effectively with many leaders of Government as have other leaders as well. And there are many ongoing efforts along with this task force we are announcing here today. 
As leaders in a nation which ardently values religious freedom--indeed, our Nation was founded upon the principle of religious freedom--we take this opportunity to intervene at the highest levels for those whose greatest crime is to express a belief in the divine, in God. It is my personal conviction that what one does with one's own soul is the most fundamental of human rights. I believe this is a fundamental liberty with which people throughout the world are endowed, the inherent right to do this, to freely express their faith. Yet national governments routinely breach this right and wrongfully silence peaceful minority faith communities and jail their leaders. 
The statistics are striking. Fully one-half of the world's religious believers are restrained by oppressive governments from freely expressing their religious convictions. One-third to one-half of the world's believers are forced to meet clandestinely in underground cell groups or home churches, such as occurs frequently in China and Iran and many other places around the world. 
Religious persecution is waged internationally from the highest levels of government, particularly Communist and ultranationalist countries. One successful strategy is to intimidate and control believing communities by incarcerating respected religious leaders, bringing the full weight of a national government against key individuals. These prisoners suffer abuses including beatings, torture, extended incarceration and even death unless intervention is made. Such violations strike at the heart of the religious communities while blatantly breaching international treaties and fundamental human rights standards. We have the legal mandate for this action. 
Through this task force, we will appeal to heads of state, both to obtain release of key religious prisoners and to help change antagonistic policies. Individual prisoners will be assigned to individual task force members through this advocacy adoption program. 
When congressional Members petition Government leaders, the lives of religious prisoners change. Experienced human rights groups confirm this as well as some of our task force members such as Tony Hall and Joe Pitts, who confirm that such intervention improves prison conditions, stops torture and, most importantly, results in prisoner releases. 
Ultimately, the joint effort of several Members can influence hostile national policies for the good. Moreover, task force members will engage in joint protests with members from the British Parliament who have implemented a similar prisoner adoption program, providing further weight to this advocacy. 
As I speak to you today, thousands are sitting in cramped and dirty cells, for no other reason than that they peacefully expressed their religious beliefs. Most are nameless and lack advocates, yet they are the Sakharovs and the Solzhenitsyns of our day, and they deserve our help. 
The national cases that we will advocate involve advocacy for embattled religious leaders in the Sudan, Pakistan, China, Iran, and Tibet and include persecuted Christians, Tibetan Buddhists and Bahais. The following case profiles of incarcerated believers worldwide illustrate the extremities faced by these communities. 
In China, one of the people we will initially be advocating for is Bishop Su. He is a 65-year-old Catholic bishop who has 
already spent 20 years--20 years--in jails and work camps. His crime is that he believed in papal authority, which is prohibited by the Government, and refuses to join the state-authorized Catholic Church, which rejects the Vatican. Previously he was severely tortured but continues to refuse to recant his faith. 
Also in China, Pastor Peter Xu, the Protestant leader of a 3- to 4-million member Christian movement, has been sentenced to 3 years in a forced labor camp for his peaceful but unofficial religious activities. His case highlights the plight of unregistered Christian groups which are forced to meet clandestinely to avoid arrest and harassment. Such house churches remain unregistered so that they can freely practice their faith without Government control and censorship. These underground movements constitute a majority of practicing Christians in China, and their leaders constantly face arrest and incarceration. 
In Iran, the task force has targeted four Bahais leaders who have been sentenced to death for the simple reason of their religious associations. They are presently incarcerated and awaiting execution. The death sentence is no idle threat. Over 200 Bahais have been executed, including women and teenage girls. And this just since 1979. 
In Pakistan, four Christians have been falsely charged with blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammed. If convicted, they will be executed. Blasphemy charges are potent weapons of intimidation and control of minority Christian communities in Pakistan. Sometimes violence erupts against entire towns. For example, last year in Shantinagar, a Christian town--we have a picture of this that I would like to show the body--20,000 were rendered homeless after a mob looted and ravaged for 2 days as police stood by and watched. 
This is a picture here that we have of a family in that community that was dislocated when the mob violence came and the police stood idly by. 
In Tibet, the 11th Panchen Lama of Tibet, a 6-year old boy, has `disappeared' and most likely is being held by the Chinese Government along with his family, in an attempt to control the Tibetan Buddhists. This is a deep assault on the Buddhist faith which honors this figure as second only to the Dalai Lama, who is now also outlawed. Tibetan Buddhists are suffering a systematic policy of eradication with monasteries being razed and monks and nuns incarcerated. One prison alone boasts over 100 monks and nuns who are presently jailed just for their faith. This does not include the unknown numbers incarcerated in the other six prisons. 
I want to show some pictures to the body of people who have been incarcerated, penalized, and attacked by governments for simply practicing their faith. We remember those people pictured in various places throughout the world that you can see, pictures of individuals who are being persecuted for their faith. 
This is another picture of people who are practicing their faith clandestinely at a place in the world where they cannot practice their faith in the open. 
The gentleman's picture over here to the far right is also a true case of an individual blindfolded and being attacked for his own faith. Even though he is blindfolded and you cannot see his eyes, you can sense in his face that here is a man of faith who knows what he is facing, knowing that death is potential, and still standing for his faith, for that simple right to do with his own soul what he sees fit. Isn't it right for us to advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves? Isn't it up to this body and many others to say that this is a fundamental human right, that this man should have an advocate, that we should be standing with him as he stands there for the simple reason of his own faith, whatever that faith might be? This is a foundational human right. It is time we stood up, stepped forward and spoke out around the world to the world's governments where half of the people live who cannot practice their faith freely. This is the time for us to do that. I hate to think that we will not step up or we will not be up to the cause of the moment, people such as this gentleman, who stands and faces so much more. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, we hope that the Religious Prisoners Congressional Task Force, along with many other efforts, will be a voice for religious freedom internationally. Our goal is the release of prisoners who have taken a stand for religious liberty, those who have paid the high price of loss of freedom and threat to life and even death. They deserve our advocacy for this most personal of human rights, this most important of human rights, to freely express a belief in God. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I note the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. On behalf of the majority leader, I announce that this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. At 10:30 a.m, as previously agreed to, the Senate will proceed to a rollcall vote on or in relation to the McCain amendment regarding demonstration projects to S. 1173, the highway bill. Following that vote, the Senate will attempt to complete action on the remaining amendments to the bill, including final passage. Following disposition of S. 1173, the Senate may begin consideration of S. 414, the international shipping bill, under a short-time agreement. In addition, the Senate may also begin consideration of H.R. 2646, the A+ education bill. Therefore, Members should anticipate a busy voting day with votes occurring into the early evening. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the McCain amendment to require that demonstration projects be funded from each state's allocation and be subject to annual limitation. 
The current system for designating large construction projects advantages a few states over the majority. It prioritizes construction needs based more on political seniority that it does an impartial evaluation of transportation needs. It creates pressure for Members of Congress to engage in porkbarrel spending rather than to concentrate on prudent national policy. I believe the McCain amendment would help move us away from this system because it would not give states or members an incentive to seek out demonstration or critical needs projects, as securing these projects would not increase the amount of federal funds flowing to a state. 
I further support the McCain amendment because it gives states greater say in determining what projects have the highest priority for their locality. It should be up to cities, counties, and the state Departments of Transportation to prioritize what projects need immediate attention in their state--not the federal government. Too often under the current system, a state has to put aside its own priorities because it must use its own limited funds to provide matching funds for the large federally designated construction projects, or risk losing federal funding. This `Washington knows best' approach to transportation planning needs to end. 
Finally, I support this amendment because it would end a system that disadvantages the infrastructure needs of a majority of states to the benefit of a few. In order to maintain a strong, truly national infrastructure system, we must give every state the tools and funding its needs to maintain its share of the system. Ending a system that gives a few states an inordinate amount of construction dollars is one step in the right direction toward that goal. 
I applaud the Senator from Arizona for proposing this approach to increase fiscal responsibility in transportation spending and to empower the communities in which the infrastructure lies. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we have been working with all parties involved on the majority side and the minority side, and with the various committees involved with the issue, regarding rails and trails. I understand that this amendment has been agreed to and will be accepted by all of the various people involved. 
Today I offer an amendment that will increase local input in community planning regarding recreational rail-trails. Today, while a railroad is in the process of petitioning to abandon railroad tracks, outside groups may take over that right of way--and the local government may have no say in the matter whatsoever. Railroads and private groups may make decisions as to how large portions of land are used, and property owners and local governments are not even consulted. 
Under current law, a right-of-way for a railroad that is about to be abandoned may be used to establish a recreational rail-trail, thereby preserving the rail corridor in the case that the right-of-way is needed in future. The decision making authority for establishing a rail-trail lies solely with the railroad, the Surface Transportation Board, and private groups advocating trail development. A fatal flaw is that there is no component for local community involvement, including the input of those who own property adjacent to railroad corridors and who are most directly affected by the change in use of the right-of-way. 
The process of creating rail trails from old railroad lines begins when a railroad petitions the Surface Transportation Board to abandon a line. Normally, if the STB determines that a line may be abandoned, it issues the railroad a certificate of abandonment. However, under the National Trails System Act, once a railroad files a petition to abandon groups may suspend the abandonment by requesting to enter negotiations with the railroad to establish a trail. These trail groups may purchase the corridor or `railbank' it--in other words, convey the right-of-way with the provision that it will return to the railroad if it resumes service in the future. If the trail group signs a statement of willingness to assume responsibility for the right of way, and it comes to an agreement with the railroad on the terms under which the land will be conveyed, then the Surface Transportation Board is obligated to allow the group to develop the rail corridor. 
This negotiation takes place not in the communities where the proposed trails are, but rather behind closed doors here in Washington. At no point is there an opportunity for meaningful citizen participation in making the determination of the best use of the land. Many community members have learned of proposed rail trails not by reading the newspaper or by attending a community meeting, but by looking in their backyards. This is wrong. 
The issue of rail trail development is an extremely divisive issue in Kansas--perhaps more so than in any other state in the country. One reason that this issue has become so inflammatory is because Kansas state law provides that ownership of an abandoned railroad right-of-way will revert to the original property owners. However, Federal law preempts Kansas State law and prevents property owners' rights to regain possession of the land where there is a group ready to establish a trail. 
Mr. President, my goal here is not to take sides in this emotionally charged issue. I empathize with private property owners who believe that trails give rise to trespassers and crime, and lower the value of their property. Moreover, I believe it is a valid assertion that trail development, where reversionary property rights exist, constitutes a taking of private property for which just compensation should be paid. In fact, this opinion was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals in November 1996. Private property owners have legitimate concerns. 
However, I also understand the beliefs of trail advocates, who view trail development as a means of economic growth and who strive to improve the quality of life for communities. My goal here is not to `kill railbanking.' This amendment does not kill railbanking and does not impede the ability of groups to propose rail-trail projects during normal abandonment proceedings. In fact, I maintain that opposition to rail trails by property owners might not be so solidified if the property owners were more engaged in the decision making process. As it stands, the resentment they feel for having trail development forced upon them fuels their anger and strengthens their resolve to oppose both current and future trail development. 
My goal here, in fact, is to improve the process so that people on both sides of this issue will receive an equitable opportunity to air their views before any designation of a trail is made. This is not an issue of whether rail-trails are good or bad; it is an issue of whether it is the role of the federal government to engage in community planning. I contend that it is not. The federal government has authorized the development of trails on railroad rights of way, and I do not seek to dismantle that authorization. I simply believe that it should be at the discretion of the local government whether that authorization should be utilized. 
In fact, one of the hallmarks of the ISTEA legislation that we are debating today is that it through Metropolitan Planning Organizations it incorporates the concept of local involvement in transportation planning, which, prior to 1991, was largely absent from the federal program. I simply want to correct the disconnect that exists between provisions of the National Trails System Act and the philosophical underpinnings of the ISTEA legislation. 
Mr. President, I do not have an objection to the Rails to Trails program. In fact, my amendment does not limit rail-trail funding or prohibit rail-trails from being developed where they are wanted by the local community. I do, however, have an objection to a process whereby railroads, private groups, and federal bureaucrats can make sweeping land use decisions, while private property owners and local authorities are shut out. Let's improve that process by giving local governments a decision-making role. 
Mr. President, with that I urge adoption of the amendment. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the manager of this bill, who has been extraordinarily patient with us in working this through. We have worked closely with Senator Bumpers' staff. It was several days working this out. It was our understanding they had no difficulty and they were in agreement with this language. 
I also thank the Senator from New York for his kind comments. This simply does provide for a modicum of local input, to try to provide some means for people locally to comment on this. It doesn't affect existing trails. That is why we proposed this. 
I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for all of his efforts, along with those of the Senator from Montana, too. I hope we can get this resolved within the next 10 minutes if possible. I will stay here on the floor, so maybe while we are considering this next amendment, we could get this resolved right after that, if that is at all possible.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. 
Although I think our views of the world are similar on many issues and actually quite a bit similar on this particular issue, we end up coming at it, in the end conclusion, a bit differently. I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico yielding me 5 minutes for this purpose. 
Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote, of course, on an amendment proposed by the Senator from Kentucky on the ISTEA bill. As the bill stands, it mandates that `not less than 10 percent' of Federal highway and transit funds may be allocated to `disadvantaged business enterprises.' 
I want to speak specifically about this amendment that does away with racial set-asides and replaces it with an outreach program to emerging small businesses. I have really struggled with this vote. I find this a very difficult issue, not because I support quotas or because I believe racial set-asides will help bring about racial reconciliation, which is really my point of view 
and my difficulty with this because we desperately need racial reconciliation in this country. We need that to take place. We need that process to start in earnest, to move forward with the hearts and souls of people in this country. My problem is that I don't think quotas and set-asides alleviate the disadvantages many Americans face or to increase their ability to compete on a level playing field, nor do I really believe it is going to help us out with this racial reconciliation that our country so desperately needs. 
Nevertheless, this has been a hard decision to make. It will be a hard vote to cast. I would like to explain why I will vote in favor of Senator McConnell's amendment and why I have misgivings about doing so. 
First, I believe that quotas are unconstitutional. Each of us, in serving in this body, has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. The Supreme Court's ruling in Adarand is very clear. I took my oath of office to uphold the Constitution seriously. I could not, in good conscience, vote for a measure that I believe, and the Court has ruled, violates the highest law of this land. 
Second, I do not think quotas are the answer to the problems that divide us and deny equal opportunity. Quotas do nothing to address the problems that we face as a country, of not having a colorblind society. Indeed, it actually perhaps makes us more aware of the differences, rather than less aware of the differences. It doesn't address some of the underlying problems such as the break-up of families, which is the single greatest predictor of opportunities and income later in life--coming from a solid family that cares and loves the children. Quotas do not help the millions of children who attend schools where violence is commonplace and drug use is rampant. They do not help children to read, write, do arithmetic, or have the basic skills in society that we are having so much trouble with. 
Finally, I believe that set-asides are not only ineffective in bringing about racial reconciliation--this is my key point; I don't think they bring about racial reconciliation. Indeed, I think they have been counterproductive. The last several years have shown that quotas in some cases, indeed many, are an acid that further divides our Nation and corrodes the principles of equality. More than 30 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., shared his dream of a society where men and women would be judged `on the content of their character, not the color of their skin.' We all, as a country, saw those words as electric and true. This is a dream that almost all Americans continue to share--that we be judged on the content of our character, not on the color of our skin. Although we may disagree on the best means of getting there, I cannot believe that the best way to achieve a colorblind society is to call more attention to race, to count by race, and to divide by race. 
That said, the reason I have struggled with this vote is I believe that it is incumbent upon us to open the doors of opportunity to all and reach out to those Americans who have been denied those opportunities. Unfortunately, the way this debate has been spun, a vote for quotas has been equated to show concern for the disadvantaged--a portrayal both false and destructive, I think. We need to do more to extend a helping hand to those in need and to open the doors of opportunity and not only level but expand the playing field for all Americans. 
The Senator from Michigan has spoken and the Senator presiding, the Senator from Indiana, has spoken frequently about initiatives of the Renewal Alliance. I want to draw my colleagues' attention to these efforts. I think this is a serious effort at reaching out and truly showing that the way to racial reconciliation is to truly level the playing field and to expand the playing field in the areas where we are having the most opportunity. So the work in the inner cities and the work of the Renewal Alliance has been key in that. 
I think this work of the Renewal Alliance is critical because, as I have struggled with this debate--and the reason I have struggled with this vote is not because I believe quotas are the answer, because they just are not, they are not constitutional--is that if we don't have a colorblind society, what do we go to if we don't think quotas are right or constitutional? Then what? I don't think we have answered that question yet in this body. How do we address the needs to create a colorblind society? That is where I think the Renewal Alliance is reaching out and doing that and saying, here are some ways we can truly develop in inner cities, 
and reach out and say: We care, we want these places, we want you to have opportunity and growth and hope. It is just that we aren't going to do it by acid tests that we have talked about in these quotas and that we can really reach Martin Luther King's vision of a colorblind society if we try to bid out and to reach out and to hold. 
I ask my colleagues to look at the work of Senator Coats from Indiana and other people that have truly put their hearts into this and said, here is a way we can go, this is what we can do, this is not constitutional quotas. It is just not going to be. But this is what we can do, and let's do that, and let's reach out as Americans and bind arms together, of all creeds, of all kinds, of all races, of all religions, and make a bigger, better playing field in this country. 
That is why, Mr. President, I will be voting for this amendment. It is a difficult vote. And I really hope and pray that we will revisit this issue along the lines of what has been put forward as a way of expanding the hope and opportunity. 
With that, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the southwest Kansas radio station KJIL 99.1 FM for being awarded the `Station of the Year' by Focus on the Family radio ministry. 
KJIL is a 100,000 watt Christian radio station based in Meade, Kansas. Although it has been on the air for only five years, it has played a significant and positive role in the community and throughout the western region of Kansas. Last year alone, the station sponsored several family-oriented concerts, helped organize transportation for community members to the Promise-Keepers rally in Washington, and expanded its network for 16 different translator stations. 
I particularly wish to commend Don Hughes, the station manager of KJIL, for his leadership and vision. And I am particularly pleased that an organization as worthy as Focus on the Family Radio ministries has recognized the station's achievements. It is a great honor, but no great surprise, that KJIL has received the `Station of the Year' award.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks on our current Tax Code and the Tax Code Termination Act which Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas and I are introducing today, along with 24 cosponsors here in the Senate and the entire Senate leadership. 
We just held a press conference on this topic, and Senator Hutchinson, I believe, will be joining me shortly to talk about this provision. 
Mr. President, with this bill we will pull the current Tax Code up by its roots. And that is no small feat. This is a Tax Code that has roots that are down deep in the soil. I think they are hooked into bedrock. Some people believe they are there and cannot be pulled up. But they can, and they need to be for us to create another American century. 
We heard last fall, when the Senate Finance Committee held its hearings on IRS reviews, a horror across the country as people stood up to say that is what happened to them--`Let me tell you what happened to me'-- with the IRS abuses that have to be changed. But underlying the IRS is the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Service complies with the Revenue Code. The Tax Code of this land has nearly 3 million words. These are words that govern our lives. They are words that micromanage our economic and personal decisions. These are the words of Washington causing us to do certain things, or not to do certain things. There is too much social manipulation involved in the Tax Code. 
One of the leading ways that Washington uses to manipulate people's lives is the tax policy that we have. There are three basic ways. One is by regulation; another one is by subsidy. You can either regulate something to stop it, or you can subsidize something to try to grow it, or tax it, or to try to create an exception for somebody to try to fit their lives into it so they can get this economic treat at the end, or tax it here to stop people from doing something, to the point that our Tax Code now is more about social manipulation than it is about raising revenue for the Federal Government. 
To prove that point, you can just look at the cost of compliance with this Tax Code--this 2.8-million-word Tax Code that is backed up by 10 million words of regulation. It costs over $150 billion a year just to comply with this Tax Code. That is before a single cent is paid on taxes. It costs over $150 billion a year to comply with this Code. 
To give people an idea about how much that is, basically, if we took every car made in America and drove them into the ocean, that would be about the equivalent of what takes place with this. That is how much economic activity we are talking about; not that we should begrudge those people who make their livelihood by figuring taxes. They are good, honest, hard-working Americans. We shouldn't have so many people involved in that, and we shouldn't have a Tax Code that requires so much that people live in fear of it. 
I want another American century. I want it for my children who are 11, 9 and 7. And I think we have the time and the moment in history now to start creating, to build that next American century. I don't think you can do it with this Tax Code which micromanages economic and personal decisions out of Washington. Let people in Kansas decide how to invest their money and decide how to take care of their families instead of taking all their money from them. They can make better decisions than people in Washington. It is a fundamental premise upon which I have run, and there are a lot of people associated with this body that have run on that--that people make better personal decisions than, as in a lot of times, the Government forces them to make through the Tax Code. 
We need to get back to a Tax Code that is fairer, simpler, flatter, and, I might add as well, freer as far as allowing more freedom to the average American to be able to make their own personal decisions--making the decisions about what is best for them. 
The bill that Senator Hutchinson and I am introducing is to sunset the current Tax Code. It does not say what we should go to from this point. There are a lot of options that are out there. You can look at a national tax. You can look at a consumption-based tax. You can look at a national sales tax. You can look at some sort of tax simplification, although I have to say when I go around Kansas talking about tax simplification, they say, `I get that joke. You tried that one on us before and it didn't simplify anything.' But there are options, I think some of which we can still consider, that are out there. 
By this bill, we are not saying which options should be taken. We are simply saying by this bill, let us start the great national debate about what sort of tax system we ought to go to and do away with this one; let us drive a stake through heart of this one; let us salt the soil around where the plant grew up so it cannot grow back again; and let us debate what other sorts of systems can we go to. 
It is a very similar proposal that we made when we started to balance the budget 3 years ago. We said at that point in time, let us balance the budget within 7 years. There are lots 
of different plans out there on how to balance the budget. We did not identify at the outset that this is the way we are going to do it or that is the way. We say, by this date we will have balanced the budget. Let us start the great national debate about how we get there. It is the same thing we are doing here. We are saying by the end of the year 2001--we hopefully will have a balanced budget this year--by the year of 2001, let's have a new Tax Code and let's start the great national debate. 
Should it be a national tax? Should it be a sales tax? Should it be a simplified system? Should it be another option that is yet to be identified? And let us have that out there aggressively being talked about. We do not do anything to Social Security or Medicare chapters within the Tax Code; we leave those alone. That is a debate for another day in another arena. But, otherwise, let us have this great debate talking about what we are going to replace this onerous, complex burdensome, system with. 
The Tax Code has had its place in history. This Tax Code has. Now let's make it history. Americans are `taxed to the max.' I believe that we need to start the clock on the Tax Code and start the process of providing Americans with that flatter, simpler, fairer, freer Tax Code system based upon which they can make a lot more of their economic decisions. 
I think it is fundamental for us to create this next American century by having a different system than the onerous one we have today which people cannot understand--that regularly each year Money magazine will send a hypothetical taxpayer to 50 different accountants and get 50 different answers; or, you can ask an IRS agent. Call five of them up on the same question, and you will get five different answers. It is not that these people are not intelligent; it is that the Tax Code is unintelligible. 
I have to admit that I went to law school. I have to ask forgiveness for that of a lot of people. I took every tax course, except one, that I could in law school. This Tax Code is unintelligible. My tax law professor, the Dean of the Kansas University School of Law, had the case for driving a stake through and giving capital punishment to this Tax Code, because he says, `Look; I have spent 20 years studying this thing, and it still doesn't make sense, and it is still something that is far too burdensome, and people don't understand it, nor is it free of the American people.' 
You have to wonder why we have evolved such a system. But it is because we have taken into this Code far more the notion of behavior modification than we have of raising revenue for the Federal Government--that behavior modification that seems now to drive more of our tax policy than for what we need to raise revenue for the Federal Government. It comes from both the left and from the right. 
So, Mr. President, as the current Tax Code is anti-American and anti-government, it needs to go the way of history. Let's start this great national debate about which way we need to go. Let's involve all the people across this great land on what they think we need to do. 
I might add one other point. A number of people are concerned, who say, `OK; if you accept this Tax Code, I have made decisions based on this Tax Code, and some of these are 15-year or 20-year decisions.' They involve depreciation schedules; they involve investment decisions; they involve any number of factors. I think we will probably have to put in place substantial transition mechanisms similar to what we did on the farm bill when we changed the farm bill and we had a 7-year transition period. When we go into trade agreements, a lot of times we have 10- to 15-year transition periods, so that people that have made decisions based on this Tax Code are allowed the opportunity to say, `OK; I have a transition time period that I need to get to something else.' So they need not fear that they are going to be driven into some sort of economic chaos or that the country will by changing the Tax Code. We need to have a long and appropriate period for transition so we do not create that economic difficulty or chaos. 
This needs to be a very thoughtful and a very learned debate. And that is why Senator Hutchinson and I have introduced this bill, along with 24 cosponsors, that simply says sunset it by the end of the year 2001 so we can have plenty of time to talk about a different system to go to. And it is time. I would love to give to my children in the next millennium, as they go into it, a Tax Code where they don't have to worry, regarding every decision they make, what are its tax implications. But, rather, they just have a certain level of burden that is fair, that is low, that is appropriate, and that is one that they can feel is a system that leads to some justice. 
I am delighted we introduced this bill and I am delighted to join Tim Hutchinson in this effort to sunset the Tax Code, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in this effort and on this bill to sunset the Tax Code. 
To reiterate, this is a tax code that the annals of history will record as one of the most onerous burdens ever faced by the American people. Our bill aims to make this code history, and by moving our legislation we will take the first steps in sunsetting a tax code that has become a method by which policy makers have confiscated family income and attempted to redistribute it for the sake of big government. This must come to an end. 
I am convinced that we cannot have another American Century with this tax code. It is anti-family and anti-growth. It cannot be saved--it must be scrapped. 
Americans demand tax reform, we have promised tax reform, and now is time to deliver on that promise to the American people. Some, of course, will argue that we have to be careful about any radical changes to our tax laws. 
I agree. 
I believe that we must carefully weigh alternative plans, debate the macro and micro effects of each, and then arrive at a thoughtful and reasoned solution that is equitable and just. However, as it should be clear to anyone, what we now have in place is neither just nor equitable. If, as is often said, our tax code is fair why are the defenders so quiet? Let's have the debate. 
The bottom line is this: The tax code we now have in place punishes good investment decisions and distorts the labor market as well as our rates of national savings. It manipulates behavior by adding incentives to do one thing while punishing those who do something else. 
A quick look at some of the inadequacies in our code should make the case for reform clear. For example if your are a chronic gambler you can deduct your gambling losses. But if you are a homeowner who made an unlucky investment and the value of your home declined you have no recourse to the tax code because you cannot claim a deduction for a capital loss. The question is: why can someone deduct a loss associated with 
a bad game of blackjack but not a loss associated with their primary residence in which they were the unfortunate victim rather than a willing participant? 
The code is full of inconsistencies like the one I just mentioned. Sure, we could try and fix these problems within our tax code--and we should--but the fact of the matter is our tax code is riddled with these inconsistencies which leads me to the conclusion that we cannot reform our code, we must get rid of it. 
The bill I am sponsoring today will move us in the direction of making some of these basic changes. 
We must move to a tax system where individuals are not punished for their investments and where the national rate of savings is not distorted through unintended consequences. It is often argued that the federal government has an economic obligation to correct for market externalities where the marginal social cost exceeds the marginal social benefit. Unfortunately, the government has become a marginal externality and in so doing has created deadweight economic loss through policies which distort economic behaviour and shift incentives away from savings and investment. Economically this just doesn't make sense. In fact, I challenge anyone within hearing to find ten credible economists who will defend our current tax code. A tax system should not discriminate against the only component of our national income that provides for future economic growth--Investment. But ours does. 
Some will disagree. But this is the precise issue upon which we must focus our debate. We must decide where we want the tax to be imposed; and further, we must fully understand what effect the imposition of the tax will have on the health of the economy. 
However this debate takes shape we should have as our goal a tax system that does not distort behaviour and create deadweight loss, rather we must have as our goal a pro-growth tax system that encourages growth and increases in our national rate of savings--the true vehicle to long-run sustainable growth. We should have as our model something that is simpler, fairer and yes, flatter. 
The Hutchinson-Brownback Tax Code Elimination Act will start the great national debate on how best to change our tax code in favor of one that is more equitable to all taxpayers and less complicated for everyone. Also, our bill will enable this debate to take place outside of the realm of petty demagoguery because it protects the important funding mechanisms for Social Security and Medicare. I believe that we have a commitment to ensure that we have a full, honest and open debate--our bill will give the Senate that opportunity. 
I look forward to this important and historic debate as we prepare for the millennium and to a new century that I hope will provide the American people with a renewed sense of the American dream, with a renewed sense of what it means to be an American and what it means to live in America. 
And now as we begin this process we should keep one other thing in mind: America is watching.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today's article from today's Washington Post is yet more indication, unfortunately, of the bad faith with which Russia has been dealing with us on the transfer of sensitive technology to rogue nations, particularly, dual use and missile technology. 
I am on the Foreign Affairs Committee and chair the Middle East Subcommittee. And something that has been very troubling to me is the introduction into the Middle East, particularly into Iran and into Iraq, of technology that can be used for missile development, for use of the delivery of weapons of mass destruction, even the development of weapons of mass destruction like biological warfare, biological and chemical warfare weapons. 
Evidence was in the Washington Post, again, today, that once again--not just the first time--but once again Russian companies, with links to the Government, were involved in violating the U.N. authorized embargo on sales to Iraq of dual-use equipment. And this is outrageous. And it is preposterous that they would be doing it. 
The transfer to Iraq--which is a rogue nation, with a leader who does not operate under internationally recognized civilized codes--of any dual-use technology is unacceptable. And yet once again today we have another example. 
The transfer of equipment, such as the fermentation equipment, which was alluded to today, which can be used to develop biological weapons, and the possible collusion with the Iraqis against UNSCOM to hide technology and weapons, is proof of a cynical bad faith which is untenable. 
If this information is true--and I am told it is well grounded--the Russians are making a mockery of a very serious issue, and, more importantly, they are putting U.S. forces at increased risk. 
This type of behavior has immense implications for a policy towards Iran as well and the administration's efforts to curb these sales of equipment that can be used to deliver or to develop weapons of mass destruction. This cynicism should not be rewarded. 
I understand that we have been holding up Senate bill 1311, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act, in deference to the Russians to give them time to prove their good faith and in deference to the Vice President's meeting with them in March. In view of the latest developments and this information, I believe such deference is misplaced. I request that Senate bill 1311 be moved up on the Senate calendar. I will make that request known to the leadership and ask that they proceed forward because this `good faith' that we are offering has obviously been received in a way of making bad-faith steps by the Russians and is further proof today this cannot be allowed to continue. Every day it is allowed to continue, more and more U.S. lives are at risk. It cannot be allowed to continue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the matter of human cloning. 
I believe that as the Senate debates this issue that is so fundamental to the meaning and the essence of what it means to be a person we must consider very carefully the moral implications associated with the issue of human cloning. 
Certainly there is no moral prohibition, nor could one effectively be argued, against the cloning of plants or even animals--there is something fundamentally different. Also, no one is arguing against tissue research or other important research. The issue today is strictly limited to the use of technologically feasible methods to create and manipulate new life through a process of human cloning. And beyond that, the issue is whether or not it is morally permissible to clone human beings. 
This issue demands the public attention because it implicitly revolves around the meaning of human dignity and the inalienable rights that belong to every person. 
But before discussing this in particular I think it is necessary to engage in a discussion on an even more fundamental level. 
What is even more fundamental in this discussion is the question of the place occupied by 
the birth of a new child in our society. 
First it is worth noting that there is a symmetrical quality to the current debate in our culture. And although the underlying philosophical premise is the same, the outcomes are radically different. I believe it is one of the tragedies of our times that in the midst of a culture which has allowed over 35 million abortions to be performed over the last twenty-five years, we now desire to create human life by our own hands. On the one hand, we deny God's creation, on the other, we seek to create life in our own image and deny God yet again. This is tragic on both counts. 
I personally believe, and 2,000 years of Western tradition support this belief, that the birth of any child is an unmerited gift from God to a man and woman. Some in recent years, have given us a notion of a child as an object merely for the fulfillment of a man and woman's personal desire. It should be reasserted though that a child is not and can never be an object merely for the fulfillment of a man and woman's personal desire. A child is a precious and unmerited gift from God. God alone gives human life--but human cloning usurps that role. And I do not believe that we can ever do that. 
The creation of new life outside of man and woman is a gross distortion of the moral natural law. 
Human cloning distorts the relationship between man and woman by negating the necessity of either one in the creation of new life and consequently also usurps the role of God in the creation of new life. Fundamentally, it alters the view of the child to the world in such a way that the child is seen as something which can fulfill the needs of an individual physically, emotionally or spiritually. This is an incorrect view and is a gross violation of our duty to protect the human dignity of each and every person. It reduces a child to a means to an end and denies them the dignity they deserve to be treated not as a means but as an end in and of themselves. 
And this notion is precisely where the disagreement on this issue exists between the Administration and the cloning bill before us today. 
Some will argue that the issue simply needs to be studied before any research begins--a notion which does not rest on the supposition of a child as a gift. This is wrong. There is no research that can ever justify the willful technological manipulation and creation of human life through the process of human cloning for the furtherance of science--or even for the preservation of humanity. 
The White House doesn't want a permanent ban--they want a limited moratorium. This indicates that they believe there may be a use for this technology as it relates to the issue of human cloning. But no such use exists. The act of cloning a human being for the purposes of study, or for the purpose of bringing new life into the world is intrinsically evil and should be absolutely prohibited. 
Also, there is another dimension to this debate which is fraught with problems and that is the rationale that will develop should cloning be allowed. 
But what few have mentioned in this discourse is that implicit in the rush to begin cloning human beings is the eugenic rationale that will ultimately develop in support of it. Already, there are stories--what I would call horror stories--of people asking for specific genetic attributes when deciding to participate in in vitro fertilization. And when we are able to shop for a baby in the same way that we shop for a car; by whimsically creating new life based solely on our own personal convenience and satisfying our own personal desire, we effectively say: `God we do not need You anymore, we can do this ourselves.' 
And that is just wrong. 
Mr. President, it would be a serious mistake and an abdication of our duty as responsible legislators to allow the devaluation of human life that would take place if we allowed for human cloning. There should be no human cloning. Period. 
Mr. President, as we continue to debate this issue I would urge my colleagues to examine the role of our government in this debate and to then reach the only conclusion possible: that human cloning seriously threatens the dignity of human beings and it is our responsibility to absolutely prohibit human cloning and in so doing decisively end debate on this issue once and for all.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee and I note, 
last night an attempt was made on the life of President Eduard Shevardnadze of The Republic of Georgia by assailants who have yet to be identified. President Shevardnadze survived the attack without injury. Unfortunately several members of his personal security detail were killed, and number of others were wounded. 
The Republic of Georgia is one of the key linchpins of the new Eurasia. It is the most democratic of all of the states that succeeded the Soviet Union. Under President Shevardnadze's inspired leadership a civil war has been put to rest, criminals have been jailed, private armies have been disarmed, and economic decline has been reversed. In 1997, Georgia's economy grew by nearly 8 percent, inflation was held in check and the Georgian currency remained rock solid. Democracy has flourished. Indeed, if democracy is allowed to fail in Georgia, it is unlikely to succeed anywhere in the region. 
Any attempt to kill Shevardnadze must be seen in those context. It is an attempt to derail a successful democratic process, and an effort to compromise the growing number of U.S. economic and strategic interests in Georgia and the region. 
According to Georgian authorities, the attempted assassination was well-planned and well-executed by as many as 30 well-trained assailants. They were armed with rocket propelled grenades and automatic weapons. The Georgians are asking, as we must ask: How could a group this size operate undetected in the capital of Georgia? Where did they receive arms and ammunition? Who trained them? Where did they disappear to in the aftermath? And most importantly: Whose interests do they represent? 
Georgian authorities make it clear that they suspect outside powers of this attempt on the life of their president. They are not alone. Azerbaijan's president Aliyev was also the object of an assassination attempt in recent days, which Azerbaijani authorities believe was planned and executed by outsiders. We should be mindful that these two cowardly acts may be part of a plan to destabilize the Caucasus with the intention of scaring off American and other investors who seek to bring the Caspian's great energy wealth west to international markets. 
Who benefits from promoting instability in the Southern Caucasus at this time? Russia is everyone's leading candidate as the outside power with the most to gain. Russia has long raged and conspired to thwart Caspian energy from flowing any direction but north through Russia. Most parts of Russia's political elite still view Caspian wealth as their own. The suspected perpetrator of an earlier assassination attempt on Shevardnadze remains under Russian care despite vociferous demands from Georgia that he be extradited. Russia still has bases in Georgia from which yesterday's attack could be planned and staged. None of this is proof of Russian complicity, but the strong suspicion of Russian involvement will not go away quickly.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, many of the lessons that we have learned regarding agricultural trade strategy, to change the subject to one that we have been not necessary been talking recently, have taken a lot of time for us to learn. I used to work in this field, the trade field. I worked for the Secretary of Agriculture, and I have been around some of these negotiations. 
It took the United States forty years of multilateral negotiations, but in the Uruguay Round, we finally got it right: in order to achieve meaningful agricultural market liberalization, we must link progress in agricultural liberalization to progress in other sectors critical to our trading partners. 
Throughout the world, agriculture is one of the most highly protected industries. It is also represents one of the strongest comparative advantages that the United States enjoys. Additionally, the U.S. agriculture industry is a critical building block of this economy, employing 22.7 million people. That is about 17 percent of the total domestic labor force. Agriculture also contributed $997.7 billion dollars to our economy in 1996. In other words, 13.1 percent of our country's GDP is agriculture-based. Furthermore, a large portion of what we produce in the U.S: roughly 40 percent--is consumed overseas. 
Because agriculture is so critical to the U.S. economy and so reliant on exports, I find it exceedingly troubling, along with Senator Grassley, to hear the recent news reports that the office of the United States Trade Representative plans to pursue a trans-Atlantic trade pact that would not address agricultural issues. The barriers to U.S. agricultural exports represent some of the most significant market access problems that the United States currently faces in Europe. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently engaged in a number of outstanding trade disputes with the EU regarding agricultural matters, and these are among the most intractable issues between our two continents. It is incomprehensible to me that the U.S. would consider entering negotiations that would overlook these crucial issues. 
Today I am joining with Senator Grassley in submitting a Senate Concurrent Resolution, which expresses the sense of the Congress that the EU is unfairly restricting the importation of United States agriculture products and that the elimination of such restrictions should be a top priority in trade negotiations with the European Union. 
Mr. President, quite simply, it would be foolhardy for the United States to proceed with negotiations that avoid some of the issues that it has been seeking most desperately to advance. Without the leverage that is gained by simultaneously negotiating access in areas where the U.S. seeks greater access with the areas in which the EU would like greater access, the U.S. is positioning itself to hand over the keys to the bank. While leaving out the touchy issues in agriculture may allow the U.S. to quickly conclude an agreement, it is a strategy that would undermine the long-run economic interests of this country. 
I hope my colleagues will join with me in sending a message to this Administration that the agriculture industry is not willing to be sold out for the sake of an chance to culminate a quick trade deal. We will not support any new trade negotiations unless agriculture issues are advanced on the same time frame as issues involving other sectors of the economy.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this bill designating Washington National airport as the `Ronald Reagan National Airport.' Mr. President, I am honored to participate in renaming this airport after such a distinguished American. 
Ronald Reagan presided over an era of tumultuous change and great challenge. His policies helped reverse stagflation and high interest rates, and unleashed the longest economic recovery in recent history. 
His courage extended freedom around the world. Ronald Reagan knew that weakness is provocative. He not only restored America's military strength, but challenged the tyrants who would shed American blood and deny freedom to others. He confronted terrorists boldly and decisively--with or without the assistance of other nations. He defied conventional wisdom to challenge Mr. Gorbachev to `tear down [this] wall.' And the wall fell. He demonstrated that America would stand strong--even when she stood alone. 
But perhaps most importantly, Ronald Reagan helped restore faith in the American dream. When Reagan took office, America, is was said, was suffering from `malaise.' Reagan reaffirmed the vision of a `shining city on a hill.' He spoke to the hopes and dreams of ordinary citizens for opportunity, achievement, and growth. He helped dispel the public cynicism that had darkened politics for years, and celebrating the dawning of `morning in America.' 
President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said that `the presidency is pre-eminently a place of moral leadership.' It was in this area that Reagan's leadership was the most significant. Reagan was always more simple than subtle. The American people knew where he stood, and what he stood for. In times of economic or international crisis, Americans knew that Reagan's word was true, and that his resolve would not waver. 
It is for these reasons that I offer my support for S. 1575, to honor a man who honored America.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senate Resolution 172, which commemorates the 50th Anniversary of independence of Sri Lanka. I believe it is appropriate that we so mark this occasion by offering our congratulations to her excellency, President Kumaratunga and the people of Sri Lanka. 
In the first five decades since Sri Lanka gained its independence from British colonial rule, Sri Lanka has held regular national elections as well as provincial and local government elections. The most recent parliamentary elections were held in August 1994, and the third presidential election was held in November 1994. 
Sri Lanka has prospered economically since 1977, when it introduced economic liberalization policies which shifted the economy away from state controls, subsidies and public sector involvement to a market-oriented system in which private entrepreneurship flourishes. The U.S. is Sri Lanka's largest trading partner, accounting for 30% of the latter's exports, and over 90 U.S. companies have invested in Sri Lanka, with a heavy concentration in mining and textiles. 
U.S. official relations with Sri Lanka date back to 1850 when John Black, an American merchant residing in Colombo was appointed the first American commercial agent in GALLE. Fifty years later the agency moved to Colombo and became a consulate. It subsequently became an embassy in 1948 after Sri Lanka became independent. 
The exchange of bilateral visits has played an important role in strengthening the cordial relations between our two nations. Then Secretary of State John Foster Dulles visited Sri Lanka soon after its independence, and since that time members of this body as well as our colleagues in the House have regularly visited this lovely country. 
Despite its prosperity and commitment to democratic principles, Sri Lanka has been plagued for many years by two domestic insurgencies, one mainly Tamil in the North, and the other mainly Sinhalese, in the South. The result has been the loss of many lives and heavy damage to property. The government has reiterated its commitment to addressing grievances articulated by these groups through dialog and the process of negotiation. Four rounds of unconditional talks with the Tamil Tiger separatists were held following the President's election in November 1994, and a cease fire was subsequently reached. This however, was breached by the separatists after 3 1/2 months when they resumed their terrorist activity. 
As a result of these terrorist actions at home, Sri Lanka has placed counter terrorism at the forefront of its foreign policy. Sri Lanka was the Vice Chair of the United Nations Ad hoc Committee on Terrorism and played an important role in the drafting of the Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombing, being the first to sign the Convention at United Nations Headquarters on January 12, 1998. 
I am therefore, Mr. President, pleased to introduce this Senate Resolution. I want to commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Helms and the ranking member, Mr. Biden for their support. 
I urge my colleagues to vote `yea' on this Senate Resolution.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I appreciate the recognition and the statement of the Senator from Wyoming, with which I associate myself. 
I rise to make a few remarks on the President's $1.7 trillion budget proposal. Most people can't even recognize exactly what $1.7 trillion is, as a size, a quantity of money. 
I believe one of the biggest challenges facing this second session of the 105th Congress is to maintain the fiscal discipline that we exercised during consideration of the historic bipartisan budget agreement. Unfortunately, after reviewing the budget it appears that the administration wants to walk away from that challenge, and that is truly regrettable for Americans today, for Americans born in the future, and certainly for the baby boomers soon to be retiring--in less than 15 years. 
In this budget the President pretends to be fiscally responsible while at the same time calling for massive new spending programs, new programs in many areas that he says were directed towards helping families. But if the President really wants to help families, why doesn't he propose ending the marriage penalty that penalizes people for being married? Why doesn't he ask for marginal tax rate reduction? But, instead, it's just proposing more of the same tax-and-spend policies that have given us the era of big Government, which was supposedly over. It appears as if the era of big Government is back with a vengeance. 
In contrast to the President, I believe that we must hold the line on the size of the Government and reject attempts by this administration to bolster spending in violation of our bipartisan budget agreement. Remember, this bipartisan budget agreement was not just the product of last year. It was something we have been struggling for 3 years, to get an agreement on the budget. For 3 years we have been fighting about how can we restrain Federal spending, get it in line with receipts so we could get to a balanced budget agreement. We have been struggling for 3 years on that, yet now, less than 7 months after the agreement, the President is walking away. This is in gross violation of this agreement. We cannot let the administration mortgage away our children's future in order to help satisfy this insatiable appetite for big Government spending. We must be able to deal with these problems within the framework that we have already agreed to. 
I just want to point out a few things, and I know some people have already done this but in case we get carried with away with the idea that now we have these surpluses and everything is rosy, we can spend to our heart's content, I don't know how many people realize, I hope most do, that once we get to a balanced budget it has nothing to do with the mortgage we already have on the country, 
which is $5.4 trillion, over $20,000 per American. It has nothing to do with the unfunded obligations that we are on the hook for when the baby boomers and others start retiring, that extend to about $14 trillion in addition to the $5.4 trillion. 
Here we are talking about being responsible for Medicare payments for when the baby boomers start retiring. We are talking about other entitlement programs that people have paid into, that there is an obligation by the Government, but we do not have funds set aside to take care of these obligations. 
So you are looking at taxing future generations more and more and more to be able to meet those obligations at a time when, if we would exercise a minimum amount of fiscal discipline, just do the budget agreement we have already agreed to, we can start to deal with some of these unfunded obligations. 
In case people think this is a long way off in the future, the baby boomers start retiring in less than 15 years, and they are going to be, instead of pulling the wagon, in the wagon saying, `You obligated yourself, I paid into these funds, now I am calling on these.' 
The percentage of the Federal Government, as a percentage of the overall economy, is at historically high levels, nearly 20 percent of the economy. If the President wants all these new spending programs, why doesn't he propose equal cuts to other Government programs? Does anybody in this body allege that we don't have significant amounts of Government waste in spending? Let's cut those programs if he wants the new spending programs, rather than adding more and more taxes and fees and burdens on the American public. That would be the way to deal with this, is to try to get at some of the wasteful spending programs that we already have. 
I look forward to working with the administration on this budget, but we cannot break this hard-fought bipartisan budget agreement on the altar of just more and more taxing and spending that keeps driving up the cost of Government, keeps taking more and more from taxpayers, keeps making it harder and harder for the average family to make a living and to be able to support their own children like they would like to do. 
So I have great disappointment with what the administration has put forward in growing and in getting back to the era of bigger Government. I am afraid we are just going to have to push to maintain what our agreement was this past year. I think it is regretful that we are at that point. Madam President, it seems as if we are. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last Friday, January 23rd, was the birthday of President Eduard Shevardnadze. This is a man whose active and courageous involvement helped bring the cold war to a peaceful end and who is now rebuilding Georgia from a ruinous civil war. He has taken a courageous position, even in the face of assassination attempts, to bring about and maintain the independence of freedom of his native country, Georgia. 
Mr. Shevardnadze is working hard to bring about difficult economic reform and to build an independent legislative branch. He has introduced some remarkable changes in Georgia: he introduced a new currency, adopted and implemented a new constitution, removed mafia leaders from powerful positions, secured the transportation of Caspian oil through Georgia and has worked hard at establishing regional cooperation with other leaders in the Caucasus and Central Asia. His dedication to furthering independence, economic prosperity and harmony in the region places him as a historic world figure. Mr. Shevardnadze's achievements should be noted and recognized on the occasion of his 70th birthday.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, yesterday Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Kerrey joined me in introducing the Federal Statistical System Act of 1997. This legislation will also be introduced in the House by Representatives Horn and Maloney. This commonsense piece of legislation will improve the quality of an important function of the Federal Government while reducing its cost. 
The current Federal statistical system is in disarray. There are more than 70 Federal agencies responsible for gathering and analyzing statistics. Many of these agencies expend resources attempting to gather the same information from the same sources. This duplication is unnecessarily burdensome on both taxpayers and respondents. Although a small group of people in the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] is nominally responsible for coordinating Federal efforts, no one in the Federal Government is held accountable for maintaining the quality of the Government statistics or overseeing the modernization of the statistical system. 
The Federal Government spends $2.6 billion each year to finance this thicket of Federal statistical programs. Yet, in spite of the resources we dedicate to gathering and analyzing statistics, Americans have lost confidence in the quality of Government data. For example, over the past several years, a debate has raged over the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index. According to the General Accounting Office, the 1990 census was inaccurate and the 2000 census is a high-risk project that may produce unsatisfactory data again. And, according to a recent Wall Street Journal article, the Department of Treasury is unable to account for the source of billions of tax receipts this year. 
Mr. President, the Federal Statistical System Act of 1997 is a necessary first step to consolidate the Federal statistical system and improve the quality of Government data. This legislation would establish a Federal Commission on Statistical Policy to recommend how the Federal statistical system should be reorganized and streamlined, and to draft legislation to consolidate the three largest Federal statistical agencies--the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis--into a single Federal Statistical Service. 
After the Federal Statistical Service legislation is enacted, the commission shall then study and develop recommendations on which other Federal statistical organizations should be consolidated, eliminated or reorganized. The commission shall also make recommendations on issues regarding privacy of information collected by the Federal government, the use of statistical data in Federal funding formulas, and standards of accuracy of Federal data. 
Finally, Federal Statistical System Act of 1997 will allow the Federal Government to reduce further the cost and improve the accuracy of statistical programs while reducing the reporting burden on respondents. This will be achieved by certain agencies to share nonidentifiable statistical information, exclusively for statistical purposes. This provision will also ensure that existing avenues and limitations for public access to Government information under the Privacy Act of Freedom of Information Act are retained without change. 
Mr. President, we cannot improve the effectiveness and reduce the cost of Government programs unless we have a firm grasp on the measures we use to implement and judge them. We cannot make an accurate assessment of our economic progress unless our relevant activity in today's economy is measured. Finally, we cannot make informed assessments on the state of our urban or rural areas and communities unless we have accurate and meaningful economic and social indicators. I believe Federal Statistical System Act of 1997 is an important first step in streamlining Government and improving the quality of Government information, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am introducing the Silk Road Strategy Act of 1977. This is an overarching policy between the countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia, which includes the countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Those are not common names to most Americans, but the area of the world that they are around, the Caspian Sea, I think, is going to become far more common knowledge to many Americans, as there is 4 trillion dollars worth of known oil and gas in the region. 
The region is reaching out to us. They are seeking to put off the Russian imperialism that has been in the region for years and seeking to get away from Iranian influence in the area. 
Thus, we are putting forward this Silk Road strategy as an active and positive role in reviving the economies of this region of the world and to building them as major forces. 
I think the United States has a vital political, social and economic interest in the region, and we need to act now rather than later. I don't think our window of opportunity in working with these countries as they seek freedom and yearn to be free and build opportunity for their people is long. Probably within the next 3 years, they are going to be making courses and decisions that will decide the long-term fate of the people of this region. 
They seek to be united with the United States. I ask, overall, that my colleagues look at this potential opportunity, at this bill and support the Silk Road Strategy Act of 1997. It is a key interest area for us and our future. 
This bill is aimed at focusing the attention of U.S. policy on the need to play an active and positive role in reviving the economies of these parts of the ancient Silk Road which was once the economic lifeline of Central Asia and the South Caucasus and the main transportation corridor to Europe and the West. 
The United States has vital political, social, and economic interests there and they need to be acted on now, before it is too late. These countries are at an historic crossroad: They are independent for the first time in almost a century, located at the juncture of many of today's major world forces and they are all rich in natural resources. They are emerging from almost a century of plunder by a Communist regime which, while it actively drained their resources, put little back. They now find themselves free to govern themselves, and they are looking west. 
The very fact that they have little experience of independence and that their economies are essentially starting from scratch, leaves them in a precarious situation, which is all the more precarious because of their geographic location: consider this: They are placed between the Empire from which they recently declared independence and an extremist Islamic regime to the south--both of which have a strong interest in exerting economic and political pressure upon them. 
These countries are very important to us: 
They are a major force in containing the spread northward of anti-western Iranian extremism. Though Iranian activity in the region has been less blatant than elsewhere in the world, they are working very hard to bring the region into their sphere of influence and economic control. 
The Caspian Sea basin contains proven oil and gas reserves which, potentially, could rank third in the world after the Middle East and Russia and exceed $4 trillion in value. Investment in this region could ultimately reduce United States dependence on oil imports from the volatile Persian Gulf and could provide regional supplies as an alternative to Iranian sources. 
Strong market economies near Russia and China can only help to positively influence these two countries on their rocky path toward freedom. 
Finally, this region offers us a historic opportunity to spread freedom and democratic ideals. After years of fighting communism in this region, the doors are open to promote institutions of democratic government and to create the conditions for the growth of pluralistic societies, including religious tolerance. 
The single best way to consolidate our goals in the region is to promote regional cooperation and policies which will strengthen the sovereignty of each nation. Each of these countries has its own individual needs; however, many of the problems in the region overlap and are shared, and a number of common solutions and approaches can apply. This bill encourages this goal. 
All of the Silk Road countries are currently seeking U.S. investment and encouragement, and they are looking to us to assist them in working out regional political, economic and strategic cooperation. This bill authorizes assistance in all these areas. 
Given the correct infrastructure development, this region is and will continue to become, a key transit point that will ultimately link Central Asia with the West--as it did in the time when 
caravans traveled along these same routes in the Middle Ages. 
Opportunities to assist this infrastructure development abound--taking advantage of these opportunities could not only cement political ties, but commercial and economic ones as well. 
The United States should do everything possible to promote this sovereignty and independence, as well as encourage solid diplomatic and economic cooperation between these nations. 
In order to do this we need to take a number of positive steps: We should be strong and active in helping to resolve local conflicts; we should be providing economic assistance to provide positive incentives for international private investments and increased trade; we should be assisting in the development of infrastructure necessary for communities, transportation, and energy and trade on an East-West axis; we should be providing security assistance to help fight the scourge of narcotics trafficking, the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the spread or organized crime; and--perhaps the most important of all--we should be supplying all the assistance possible to strengthen democracy, tolerance and the development of civil society. These are the best ways to insure these countries remain independent and strong and that they move toward open and free government. 
Mr. President, the time to focus and act in this region is now. We have the opportunity to help these countries rebuild from the ground up and to encourage them to continue their strong independent stances, especially in relation to Iran and the spread of extremist, anti-Western fundamentalism, which is one of the most clear and present dangers facing the United States today. I hope my colleagues will join me and support his bill.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to submit for the record an address delivered by my colleague, Senator Abraham from Michigan, to Legatus, a group of Catholic business leaders concerned to bring their faith into their economic and public lives. 
We live in an era, Mr. President, in which religious Americans are faced with a number of obstacles as they seek to live their faith in our public square. I believe that Senator Abraham well states the dilemma faced by people of faith and I hope our citizens, and Members of this body in particular, will heed his call for greater understanding and accommodation for religious principles and beliefs. 
As we face a continuing breakdown of our families and communities, I believe it is essential that we return to the fundamental institutions, beliefs and practices on which our society was founded. And to do that we must recognize the central role religion has and must continue to play in shaping our character and our community.

It is important to recognize the valuable contributions that immigrants make to this country.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I take the Senate floor today to mark the anniversary of a noble and courageous effort made on behalf of our Nation by some of the brave residents, of our then very young State of Kansas. 
Mr. President, 135 years ago today in the year 1862, the first Kansas colored infantry were the first union black troops of the Civil War to engage in combat--October 28th and 29th at Island Mound, or Toothman's Mound, near the town of Butler in Bates County, MO, near my hometown. 
The intrepid first Kansas colored infantry's contribution at Toothman's Mound helped prompt President Abraham Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation barely 2 months later and inspired hundreds of thousands of other black soldiers to take up arms in the cause of Union and free soil--undoubtedly influencing the outcome of that war and perhaps proving decisive in preserving government of the people, by the people, and for the people in the world as we know it. 
Let me emphasize, the survival of our experiment in self-government was at stake, and these individuals paid the price to ensure that our Constitution would not perish from the Earth. 
One of the easy mistakes when reading history is to assume that the outcome of great struggles was inevitable. This is not so. History is contingent, dependent on the choices and actions of real people. Things might have been very different if a few brave people hadn't acted as they did. 
Without the sacrifice of our Founders we might never have known independence, certainly not in the form we now enjoy--and without the sacrifices of subsequent generations, most especially of people like those who served in the first Kansas colored infantry, our forebearers most precious gift--liberty under law--would be lost. 
Mr. President the example of service, dedication, and courage set by the first Kansas colored infantry at the very moment of our Nation's greatest need should be always with us as we carry on our work here in the crucible of liberty. 
Mr. President, those soldiers had reason to doubt America's promise of liberty and justice for all. But when freedom called they answered, and we are forever in their debt. 
In these often selfish and cynical times, we should pause and thankfully remember the first Kansas colored infantry. The blows they struck for freedom and Union, place us forever in their debt.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ann Harris and her memory. 
The Harris family, who I have known for over 20 years, recently suffered the loss of their 17-year-old daughter, Ann. She was the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting. 
It is a gross understatement to say that that moment changed their lives forever, but it certainly did exactly that. Confronted with such an atrocity, many people would have used the occasion to question the existence of evil in our society and to ask why such a horrible event could have happened to such an innocent person, and to simply ask the question of `Why? Why? Why? Why has our society become so crime-ridden? Why was such an innocent girl's life taken? Why Ann's life?' 
Members have a picture of Ann at their desk. This is Ann's Campaign which they have launched. 
When their daughter was shot, the Harris family had an occasion to ask just those same questions that I asked, but they did not ask just those questions. They went further and asked the deeper questions. 
They realized that by turning this extraordinary incident, extraordinarily terrible incident--and also by us changing our ordinary incidents--events in our lives into true occasions of loving and of serving God, our communities, and one another, that we begin to change society, not to mention ourselves, for the better. And more importantly, we change them in a way that mitigates against the evil influences that have come to dominate many aspects of this culture. 
The Harris family could have used the horrors of this world as an excuse to turn away from God, but, you know, they didn't. Instead, they turned to God and asked quietly, asked humbly, not why--but what? `What do you want us to do? What can we do to make the world a better place? What can we do to keep the memory of our daughter alive?' 
Out of that question came a wonderful foundation dedicated to preserving the memory of the daughter the Harris family lost and to fighting the spread of violent crime in our society. 
Ann's Campaign for a Safer America--that is what this card is--was established by Jean and Coleman Harris following the brutal death of their daughter. Ann's Campaign for a Safer America seeks to encourage, motivate, educate, and help youth and adults alike to live the life radiated like their daughter did--a life that said every day and in every way: smile more, care more, love more and be more understanding. 
The Harris family is combating violence by combating the problems that often lead to violence. And I believe Ann's Campaign is a unique opportunity to help contribute to the restoration of our culture by directly combating the influences that denigrate and ultimately compromise our moral worth as a nation. 
The Harris family has turned a horrible event into an occasion of enriching the community and the country. We too can turn the events of our lives, the extraordinary, the terrible, and the good, along with the ordinary, into occasions of remembering to help others, to serve and to love, and to ask the question: Not why, but what? What? What should I be doing? How should I serve? 
So I am joined by my colleague, Senator Kempthorne, and several others, in this privilege of highlighting Ann's Campaign that we note here today. 
I have a tie on as well that has smiling faces of children from around the world. That was the Ann Harris who I knew. I even knew her while her mother was pregnant with her. She had just a delightful smile and was a joy of life that was taken brutally. 
I applaud what the Harris family has done, taking that incident and turning it into something of: What can we say to our culture? How can we change? Not `Why?' But `What?' I applaud what they are doing. I ask and hope and encourage my colleagues to look at this as a campaign that they can help in as well as other people from around this Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, last week, a remarkable event took place while Congress was in recess. Two private citizens gave 1,000 low-income children in the District of Columbia a chance. 
On Monday, October 13, 1997, Ted Forstmann, the newly elected chairman of the Washington Scholarship Fund, and John Walton, director of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., each contributed $3 million for students in the District to receive a quality education. The Washington Scholarship Fund currently provides private school scholarships to 460 low-income District students. With the contributions from Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton, the Washington Scholarship Fund will be able to provide these needed scholarships to an additional 1,000 low-income students. 
Mr. Forstmann made it very clear that this initiative is not a political statement for or against public education in the District. This is simply a commitment to give children a chance to succeed. In describing the prospects of many of the District's children to William Raspberry of the Washington Post, Mr. Forstmann said, `It's like being born already dead. There are too many children like that, and I just feel we have to do what we can for them.' 
In praising this powerful gesture for children, my hope, Mr. President, is that corporate America will follow Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Walton's example. Responsible business investments include investing in human capital and the value-added impact of a quality education. There is no better investment than America's children.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I join with the distinguished Senators from Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming in introducing a bill which addresses an injustice that has developed out of current law. 
Under current law, meat and poultry products that are processed in plants which are inspected by State departments of agriculture are not allowed to be shipped over State lines. This restriction is an unfair restraint on competition which is especially discriminatory toward small processing facilities. 
State inspection programs are required to maintain standards are `at least equal to' federal inspection standards. The U.S. Department of Agriculture periodically recertifies that State programs continue to meet that standard. meeting an `equal to' standard is the same requirement that foreign meat processors must meet in order to sell their product within U.S. borders. Not allowing State inspected facilities the freedom to sell their product throughout the country after having met the same standard that allows their foreign competitors to market their product unimpeded is, quite simply, unfair. 
This arbitrary restriction has been troublesome to me ever since I was Secretary of Agriculture for Kansas. I've seen firsthand that this restriction impedes competition. In fact, I would like to insert in the Record a letter that I received from a professional in the State of Kansas who operates a State inspected plant. My constituent presents a credible case for why her business is limited because of the restriction on interstate shipment. 
Proprietors of State-inspected plants are not the only advocates of changing the law. USDA's packer concentration panel recommended an immediate repeal of this prohibition as a way to slow packer concentration. The National Association of State Department of Agriculture, which represents the Secretaries and Commissioners of Agriculture which have responsibility for overseeing State programs, strongly endorses the repeal of interstate shipment restrictions. Based on public comment solicited in the Federal Register and public hearings that were held throughout the country, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently announced its support of lifting the ban on interstate shipment. 
Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of food safety in relation to my proposal. Food safety is paramount. This measure would not in any way undermine the consumer's access to a reliable and safe product. However, this bill is not about food safety. Rather, this bill addresses an issue of commerce and trade. 
In other words, food safety is an issue of enforcing the inspection standards that are in place, whether under State or Federal oversight. If State-inspected meat is safe to be distributed in Kansas, it is safe to be shipped to Missouri, or Oklahoma, or wherever else an entrepreneur finds a customer. Conversely, if the food is not safe to be shipped over State lines, it shouldn't be distributed with the State either. 
And, as both State and federally inspected plants implement the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point system, we can be even more assured that plants throughout the country are conforming to a uniformly high set of standards. Now, more than ever, a focus on who does the inspecting has no relevance in determining where the product can be consumed safely. 
I would like to highlight the paper that the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently released in support of allowing the interstate shipment of State-inspected meat and poultry products. In this paper, the administration states its concept for legislative action and establishes certain recommendations for what that legislation should include. I believe that there is much common ground between the Secretary's guidelines and the bill that my colleagues and I are introducing today. 
I look forward to working with the USDA, as well as my colleagues here in the Senate, in order to pass and implement this legislation.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for yielding. 
I want to express my appreciation and congratulations to the conferees on the bill and what they put together. Overall, it is a good bill. There is a provision in this that I disagree with, and I will join my colleague from Minnesota in voting and stating my position against this bill because it does contain the COLA for Members of Congress. 
That amendment was offered by myself and the senior Senator from Minnesota and was a bipartisan amendment which prohibited the Congress from receiving a cost-of-living adjustment in fiscal year 1998. Mr. President, I strongly believe that Congress should not receive a COLA until we balance the budget. The Senator from Minnesota and I have different reasons for doing this but the same objective, which is to object to the COLA for Members of Congress. I note, as well, that Members of Congress have not received a COLA for several years to date. I have been involved in those fights when I was in the House. The problem for me is that I think while we are moving to balance the budget and we are asking everyone to sacrifice in getting that done, that we should not be receiving a COLA during that period of time. While we have passed legislation to balance the budget, we are not quite there yet. But we are close. 
Mr. President, it has never been my purpose in this debate to cast aspersions upon any of my colleagues or the institution of the Congress. I have great respect for the Senate and the people with whom I have the privilege to serve--all of the people in the Senate and all the people in this body. But I continue to believe that we should not receive a COLA while we are still running deficits. We should lead by example and not raise our COLA while we are still getting the Government's fiscal house in order. 
Therefore, I oppose this conference report and call on my colleagues to do the same. I believe this is the kind of leadership that is necessary to finish the work of balancing the budget and beginning to pay down our massive public debt. I think our children deserve no less. For that reason, I do oppose overall the conference report. For that reason, even though I think it has many, many, very good features and I congratulate my colleagues for putting it together, I cannot support the COLA at this point in time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I say to the Senator from Colorado he has been a leader in this effort on Members of Congress not receiving a COLA, and did put this in the bill that came from the Senate. That was the Senate provision, that there would not be a COLA for Members of Congress. That was the Senate provision. It was the House that put in otherwise. 
I recognize the work that the Senator has done, and I appreciate that very much. I also recognize the totality of the bill and the excellent qualities within it. I just want to note that because it had that provision I could not support it, but by no means question you or other Members of the Senate. Our provision did not have the COLA in it.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee for including the Brownback-Lieberman-Coats D.C. charter school amendment in the manager's amendment. I am also pleased that our amendment has bipartisan support. These charter school provisions are critical to ensure the success of charter schools in the District. Here in the Nation's Capital, unfortunately, the progress of creating charter schools has been slow. Legislation to create charter schools in the District was enacted in the last Congress but the District currently only has two charter schools. 
I, along with the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Lieberman, had the opportunity to visit one of these charter schools. The Options Public Charter School, which is just a few blocks from Capitol Hill, is the perfect example of the innovative approach charter schools bring to public education. It enrolls about 100 of the D.C. public schools most at-risk students, grades 5 to 8, and works closely with each student. As a result of this charter school education, the high school graduation rate for the Options Public Charter School is 75 percent compared to the approximate 50 percent graduation rate in the D.C. public schools. 
To make sure the D.C. public charter school system follows the success of the Options Public Charter School and continues to grow, I, along with Senator Lieberman and Senator Coats offered an amendment to expand funding for the D.C. public charter schools from $1,235,000 to $3,376,000 to ensure that current and future charter schools have adequate funding. In fiscal year 1998, the District of Columbia could have as many as 20 new charter schools. The $1.2 million appropriation is based on the budget of the two current charter schools. This amendment would also make sure there is sufficient funding for current public schools which would like to convert to a charter school. 
Our amendment would also require the D.C. education emergency board of trustees to report to Congress on their implementation of policy providing preference to new charter schools for surplus D.C. public school property. It would also establish a revolving fund for D.C. charter schools for funds not spent by May 1, 1997. Under the current legislation, any remaining funds for charter schools must go into the D.C. general fund by May 1, 1997. This provision in the amendment would simply make sure that any funds appropriated for the D.C. charter schools will only be spent on the D.C. charter schools. In addition, the D.C. education emergency board of trustees would be required to report to Congress on the capital needs of each charter school within 120 days of enactment and to take all possible steps to provide assistance in capital costs for charter schools in the meantime. 
I am pleased that our amendment is included in the manager's amendment and has the support of our Democratic colleagues. The charter school application process is underway in the District and new charter schools could begin to operate as early as January. Out goal is to make the Nation's Capital a shining city for the world to follow. One of the key elements of achieving this goal is to provide high quality education for the District's children. Charter schools in the District will inject accountability into D.C. public education, more options for parents and, most important, high quality education to the District's children.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on two bills that I have introduced aimed at limiting the size of Government and restricting its growth. One reduces the Federal Government by restricting the ability of Congress to spend money, and the other limits Government by sunsetting the Internal Revenue Code. 
First, I will discuss the Economic Growth and Debt Burden Reduction Act. Although I have only been in Congress a short time, I have reached an inescapable conclusion, and that is that Congress is much better at exercising fiscal recklessness than fiscal restraint. Accordingly, I have authored legislation that specifically restricts Congress' ability to embark on spending sprees by making it illegal to use excess Government revenues for anything other than debt reduction or tax cuts. 
Congress has historically been wholly unable to exercise fiscal restraints when given resources in excess of the current demands of the Government. I believe we need to limit the size of the Government, and this bill forces it to do so. 
Mr. President, we are going to soon approach a historic opportunity. For the first time since 1969 we are going to balance the budget. It was the last time we actually had revenues and expenditures equivalent. Now is the time for us to begin this great national debate as to, once you go into balance and you start moving into surplus, how should those surpluses be spent. In other words, whenever revenues exceed expenditures, what should they be spent upon. 
We can say go on another spending spree and spend more money, or we can pay the debt down, or we can say we will cut taxes further on an American public that is taxed too heavily. 
The bill that I put forward puts it this way: If revenues are projected to exceed the agreement levels, those excess revenues are immediately captured and reserved for tax cuts. If tax cutting legislation is not enacted, the additional revenues revert to deficit or debt reduction. This prevents any unanticipated revenues from being plowed back into higher expenditures and higher spending. 
And it seems to me that is what the American public wants us to be. They want us to pay down this massive $5.4 trillion debt --and we get from deficit into debt, start paying the debt down --and if we can't agree on cutting taxes further, then we can apply that immediately and require that it go toward the debt reduction. So we can reduce the mortgage on America, which is on our children. They are going to have to reduce the overall tax burden in this country today, which is about 38 percent of the average two-wage earner, two-child family--a 38-percent tax rate. That is at all levels of government, including Federal, State, and local.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I note at the outset we should not impose on the children of the District of Columbia what Members of the U.S. Senate are not willing to do. We did a survey of Members of the U.S. Senate to find out how many sent their children to the District of Columbia public schools. Of the 100 Members of the U.S. Senate, we were able to get ahold of 95 offices. We have not found an office yet that sends their children to the District of Columbia public schools. 
Should we require students whose families do not have the income to be able to either move to other schools or to go to private schools to stay in this public school system? I submit we should not. It is not fair to the kids. 
Listen to the statistics. These are just the facts. No. 1, 78 percent of the fourth grade students are below basic reading achievement levels in the District of Columbia. I chaired this subcommittee. I have held numerous hearings on this. I have gone to the schools. These are the facts. 
No. 2, 11 percent of the students in the D.C. public schools have avoided going to school for safety reasons. 
Fact No. 3, 11 percent of the students in the D.C. public schools report being threatened or injured with a weapon during the past school year. 
Fact No. 4, this amendment provides low-income students and their parents a choice, a choice they currently do not have under the D.C. public school system. Right now, pupils in the District do not have a choice but to risk their lives and their potential for educational achievement by going to the D.C. public schools. 
Fact No. 5, General Becton, who heads the reform in the District of Columbia public schools, said, `Give me to the year 2000. We will fix the schools up by the year 2000.' And I am behind the General and the work he is trying to do to make these public schools better. But if you are a first grade student that means you are going to be in the first and second and third grade in these schools that have failed the kids. And they have failed the children. Some of them have worked, but overall they have failed the students. They have to learn to read and write and add and subtract during those 3 years. That time is too valuable to condemn those students to that type of situation. 
It is not fair to the kids. If they had the wherewithal, if they had the income, a number of them would move out to different schools in Maryland or Virginia or to private schools. They don't have the option to be able to do that. This is not fair to the kids, to condemn them to this system. All we are asking is for students below that certain level of poverty, that they be able to have the possibility of doing what most of the Members--in fact all we have been able to find, of the 95 that we surveyed and got ahold of--all of the Members in the U.S. Senate do, and that is send their children to other schools because this system has failed. This system has failed the children, according to the District of Columbia control board itself. This system has failed the children. Let's not condemn that first grader, that second grader, that third grader, not to be able to read or write by not allowing this choice. 
One of my highest priorities as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructing, and the District of Columbia, is to make sure the children in the Nation's capital are receiving the quality education they deserve. The District's public schools, unfortunately, have failed too many students. I'm pleased to join Senators Coats, Lieberman, and Landrieu in offering this amendment to empower students and their parents in the District with a choice in their education. 
I, along with the distinguished ranking member of my subcommittee, Senator Lieberman, have held hearings to explore options to improve public education in the District. I know there are public schools which are working and where students are thriving in their learning environment. I had the privilege to visit two schools in the District: Stuart-Hobson Middle School and Options Public Charter School. I was impressed by the success of their educational programs and how the students took pride in their education. The Options Public Charter School was especially interesting as an example for future charter schools in the District to follow. These schools, unfortunately, are exceptions in the District public school system. 
The overall facts about the District public schools speak for itself: 78 percent of fourth grade students are below basic reading achievement levels; 11 percent of the D.C. public schools have avoided going to school for safety reasons; and 11 percent of the students report being threatened or injured with a weapon during the past year. We cannot continue to trap these students in an educational system that is failing them. 
This amendment provides low income students a choice they currently do not have under the D.C. public school system. Right now, pupils in the District do not have a choice but to risk their lives and their potential for educational achievement by going to the D.C. public schools. Right now, students in the District do not have a choice but to go to a D.C. public school knowing the glaring reality that the longer they remain in the D.C. public schools, the less likely they will succeed. The Coats-Lieberman-Brownback-Landrieu amendment would give low-income students and parents the choice to enroll their children in a safe environment with high quality education at a private school. Under this amendment, the parents and the students are empowered with a choice in their education. It is an immediate solution to an immediate crisis in the District. 
Gen. Julius Becton, chief executive officer and superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools, and the District of Columbia Emergency Transitional School Board of Trustees have said that they will make significant improvements by the year 2000, and I recognize and respect the work that lies ahead of them. But the year 2000 is 3 school years away. In three school years, a child progresses through grades one through three in which they learn to read, write, add, subtract, and so forth. These 3 school years are too valuable to force these students to continue in the public school system that has not delivered. 
The focus of this amendment is on the low-income student in the D.C. public schools. By providing up to $3,200 in individual scholarships to low-income families who will choose the school for their children, this amendment would give these students the chance to make sure the next three school years do not go to waste while General Becton improves the D.C. public schools. Improving the chances for these children to get the education they need is one of the most fundamental elements to restore the Nation's capital into the shining city the United States deserves. 
Mr. President, I ask the Members to support the Coats amendment and yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Abraham in introducing the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act. This legislation was completed after months of research and hearings in which we investigated the many costly structural, managerial, and programmatic problems confronting the Department. We have concluded that these problems are so severe and systemic that the department cannot be reinvented. To provide American taxpayers with the services they require at the level of efficiency and quality they demand, the Department of Commerce must be dismantled. 
The Department of Commerce is a hodgepodge of unrelated functions and missions ranging from antidumping investigations to zebra mussel research. It is comprised of 11 unrelated agencies, overseeing more than 100 programs, catering to more than 1,000 customer bases, and overlapping the work of 71 other Government offices and agencies. This entire agglomeration is unmanageable, and diminishes the quality of those Commerce functions which must be provided by the Federal Government. 
For example, historically, Secretaries of Commerce have focused their attention almost exclusively on the Department's trade functions. However, trade activities only account for 8 percent of the Department's budget, and Commerce accounts for less than 6 percent of total Federal spending on trade. Commerce is just one of 19 Federal agencies involved in trade issues, and isn't even regarded as the lead trade agency--the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is. 
However, while Secretaries of Commerce travel abroad on foreign trade missions, serious management problems have languished at Commerce headquarters. For example, in 1992 the General Accounting Office indicated that the National Weather Service modernization program and the Decennial Census--two important functions--were both experiencing severe management failures. Today, 5 years later, both of these programs remain on GAO's list of high-risk government management problems. This year, before the Governmental Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Government Management, which I chair, the Department of Commerce's inspector general testified `I think it is fair to say that there is little Departmental leadership or oversight in key administrative areas.' 
Mr. President, in part as a result of this lack of leadership, the Department has also initiated or continued to perform functions which are not just mismanaged, but are unnecessary. In fact, in many instances, the Department which professes to be the advocate for America's business has gone into competition with them. In testimony before the Subcommittee on Government Management, representatives from the private mapping, weather forecasting and venture capital industries stated that the Department of Commerce routinely competes with companies in their fields. Because taxpayers unknowingly subsidize the Departments commercial ventures, Commerce is a formidable competitor for small businesses. By going into business, Commerce also misuses taxpayer resources that should be devoted to truly governmental functions. 
Other functions performed in the Department of Commerce are just a waste of taxpayer dollars. For example, the Advanced Technology Program provides handouts to America's largest and wealthiest corporations to do product development research. This program is corporate welfare, plain and simple, and should be terminated. The Economic Development Administration duplicates the efforts of dozens of other economic development programs around the Federal Government. 
And finally, the Department of Commerce has become entirely too politicized. Most employees at Commerce are dedicated public servants. However, too many of their leaders obtained their jobs when political connections prevailed over the public good. 
The Department of Commerce began in 1902 and has evolved over the past 94 years into an agency which has no clear mission or responsibility, and is too unmanageable to reform. I believe the Department of Commerce Dismantling Act is the next necessary step in that evolution. The Commerce Department Dismantling Act would retain the important functions which are performed in Commerce, it consolidates many important functions with those performed elsewhere in the Federal Government, and it eliminates the waste. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Enzi amendment on the temporary moratorium on the expansion of gambling on tribal lands. I will just make a very brief and succinct point. In the last Congress, we passed Public Law 104-169, which established the National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission. It was for the purpose of studying the social and economic impact of gambling and reporting its findings to Congress. I supported that legislation. I thought it was important legislation, particularly since the gambling industry has expanded so much. The industry rakes in $40 billion a year annually in the United States. It operates in 23 States. The amount of money wagered annually in the United States today exceeds $500 billion --half a trillion dollars. 
There have been a number of questions regarding the industry overall. It just seems to me that what we should do is a logical progression here. We are saying there are a lot of questions regarding the impact of that amount of gambling taking place in the United States, that pervasive amount, that size of money. What we should do now is, let's pause for a moment and let's not expand this any further until we have this Commission reporting back on what the impact is to the United States. 
There have been lots of allegations of negative impacts of the gambling industry. It is widespread, it is expansive, and it is in many, many areas. Let's let this Commission meet, let's let them make a conclusion, let's let them report to Congress on these items before we expand any further than the $40 billion, 23-State industry that it is today. 
That is why I think the Senator from Wyoming is bringing up an excellent point in this. Now, I don't want my views to be construed as in opposition to the chance for economically deprived Indian nations to bring needed economic activities to their communities. That is not what this statement is about. I think it is a positive thing that tribes are striving to provide employment and health care and housing and other important services, in light of the position of where they are economically and the difficulty and the needs that they have. This amendment does not ban Indian gaming. It does not affect gaming compacts which are operational or already have been approved. It simply places a temporary prohibition on the Secretary of the Interior to approve any new tribal-State compacts. 
I think, in light of this, a national commission that has been established, and the questions regarding a societal impact on the overall United States, that this is an appropriate approach. I commend the Senator from Wyoming on this very reasonable approach. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

But this is and has been an Indian burial ground since 1855. There are plans to put a casino on it now. This is being contested. But clearly the land should remain a tribal ancestral land.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will not take too much of the Members' time to discuss this amendment, but I think it is a clear, narrow piece of legislation that is an important one, and what it involves is a particular tract of land in Kansas City that is currently being used by the Kansas Wyandot Indians, which is an informally recognized tribe, as a burial ground. This tribe has used this tract for a number of years as a burial ground. There is a branch of the Wyandot Indians in Oklahoma that is an officially recognized tribe that seeks to acquire this particular tract of land and have a casino on it. 
Now, setting aside the dispute about which tribe controls this particular tract of land, I just think it is not an appropriate thing for us to approve, or to allow a tribe, this one in Oklahoma, to acquire this land and put a casino on what has been a tribal ancestral burial ground. I think it is sacrilegious for that to occur. 
It is not that we are saying there are not enough casinos in Kansas City; we have a number of them. That is a side issue as well. What we seek by this amendment is very narrow, and that is that this tract will remain a burial ground and that it will not be used for a casino. 
We do not seek to mediate the issue of who does the land belong to. We do not seek to establish the Kansas Wyandot tribe as an official tribe. That is not a part of it. We don't seek to recognize the Wyandot Oklahoma Indians' claim to this land. We set all of that aside. This amendment simply says this land should remain an Indian burial ground as it has been for generations and it should not be transferred, it should not be land acquired on which to place a casino. 
I ask that the Members look at this particular amendment. I am going to call it back up for a vote later on if we do not have consent from all the Members. This land should not be allowed to be used for a casino. It is hallowed ground and it should be allowed as that. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Helms amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. The Helms amendment, which abolishes the National Endowment for the Arts, is the only fiscally responsible approach to the funding of the arts by the Federal Government. 
The Federal Government truly has to be downsized and more limited. Some on the Senate floor today have argued, and rightfully so, that the National Endowment for the Arts would function much better as a private endowment funded with private dollars, and I agree. We cannot let the Federal Government continue growing unabated, swallowing up the private function of our society as it grows. We have been given stewardship over the public purse, and we cannot abdicate that responsibility just to placate some of the special interests in Washington. We cannot continue wasting taxpayer dollars on the National Endowment for the Arts. 
NEA funding in this appropriations bill is over $100 million. I support the arts, but the simple truth is our Federal Government is broke. We simply cannot afford to keep on funding art when we are in this type of fiscal condition and when we have other programs that do struggle which we should be funding. 
Before we vote on this issue, I simply ask my colleagues to consider a simple question. If your family was broke, if they were in a tough financial circumstances, if they were looking at an enormous mortgage on their house, enormous debt that they have, would they be out buying art? The simple answer to that is no, they would not. 
We are in a similar situation here. We are still struggling to get the budget balanced, and we are going to get there. But once we balance it, we are still over $5 trillion in debt. That is how big the mortgage is on the country. 
We are talking about a program that I just do not think can justify itself, given the financial conditions that we are in and given the role of a limited and focused Government. I do think we ought to support the arts, and that should be done privately. That can occur and should occur. But when we are in this type of fiscal condition, funding art is clearly not an essential. Subsidizing artistic endeavors, inspiring artists is a worthwhile project but not for the Federal Government. The House has seen the wisdom to abolish this Government program. We should have the wisdom to do the same. 
In considering this amendment, there are a lot of things that it seems to me the Federal Government could do without--a smaller, better focused Federal Government, a more limited Federal Government--and have a better Federal Government at the end of the day. Here is one clear example. It is one we do not need. It is one we have had extended debate about. It is not as if this is a new topic coming up. It is time to do it, and that is why I am supporting this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am here today to address the resolution introduced in the Senate by the Senator from Oklahoma on Mother Teresa. Last week, we lost a saint when Mother Teresa passed away at age 87. We are poorer, but Heaven is richer. 
She died owning, as I have read in the news accounts, very few things here. She owned about two pairs of sandals, three robes, rosary beads. That was here. But in Heaven, she has a mountain of gold. She had touched so many different lives on this Earth. It is an incredible definition of a successful life: a loving, caring, compassionate, selfless, child of God, caring for, in many cases, the most downtrodden of God's children. Would that I could live my life as well. 
I have been struck by some of her writings and things that she has spoken about. They have been accumulated in different books. Some of the statements are absolutely precious. I want to give a couple of them here in the Senate today because I think they are so touching of indicative of what a successful life is. A successful day isn't necessarily when you pass a bill in the Senate, or that you have a successful business transaction, or you pass a test, or you win a game. But a successful day is when you positively touch another life. She did that thousands of times, millions of times, across this globe. She cared for the poorest of the poor. She said this at one point in time: 
I see God in every human being. When I wash the leper's wounds, I feel I am nursing the Lord himself. Is it not a beautiful experience? 
Imagine if each of us, every day, if we saw everything that we did as nursing and touching the Lord himself. Here she is talking 
about caring for the least of God's children in that way, and she sees it as serving the Lord himself. What about us here in the Senate? If we did something similarly, saw ourselves as touching other lives in the most positive way we possibly could, what sort of world would that make? 
Think of another quote that she gave in one of her speeches where she said this: 
Our mission is to convey God's love--not a dead God but a living God, a God of love. 
And then she added: 
I am just a little pencil in his hand. 
But what a beautiful picture he drew with that little pencil. What if each of us looked at ourselves as that little pencil, but being used to draw a beautiful picture, a panorama for others to see and to be able to enjoy, and for others to be able to grow by, for others to be able to be loved by that picture that we draw. 
I have this quote posted in my office, which I think particularly is apropos giving her just passing this week: 
At the moment of death, we will not be judged by the amount of work we have done, but by the weight of love we have put into our work. 
You just think about that in measuring each day, not by the success of whether or not we did things like a bill passing through or, again, whether we passed a test, but by the weight of love that we put into our actions and what we actually did that very day and how we touched people. Did we do it in a positive, loving fashion? Would that the world operated that way. 
My own experiences with Mother Teresa were here in the Senate. The only time that I had a chance to meet her was when she came here and received the congressional gold medal this year. We were all nervous about whether she would actually be able to physically get here because she had been ill, in poor health. She was able to make it here and she shared an hour and a half with us here in the House and in the Senate, in the rotunda area, meeting with different people. I remember so much going through that experience and thinking of reading these quotes, these pearls of wisdom she had laid out on how to live life, thinking she was going to put forward another one that day. I was holding onto each word to see, is there going to be another line like `I am just a little pencil that you can guide one's life by.' But it didn't seem to come that day. She would talk about a number of different things, but there, seemingly, were no pearls. 
Then I remember walking her out to the car, and there were throngs of people excited to see her as she waved and touched different people. The motorcade was waiting to get away. She was sitting in the car, and I went over to thank her one last time for coming in and honoring us by being here and receiving the presentation. She grabbed my hand with both of hers and stared at me with those deep eyes of hers and that little frame that she had, and she looked up at me and just said three words, and she said them four times. She said: 
All for Jesus. 
We can all have different faiths and views of the world, but that was a driving focus for her, serving her Lord. How she did it each day is a testimony to each of us of how we should live. 
We lost a saint, but the tragedy isn't that she died; the tragedy would have been had she never lived. She lived fully and gave us so much in raising our consciousness, lowering our line of sight, and redefining compassion for an entire planet. For that, I thank her and I am thankful for her life. I think we should all consider and contemplate what we can add to our own lives by the model that she gave. 
So I am delighted to support this resolution of recognition for Mother Teresa for all that she has done for this world and for the example she has lived. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thought I might put in the Record, and in the resolution there is listed a number of things that Mother Teresa did, but just for the interest of the body, it might be interesting to note some of those things that happened. 
Mother Teresa expanded her personal dedication by founding the Missionaries of Charity, which people may not be familiar with but I think most are, which included well over 3,000 members of 25 countries who devote their entire lives to serving the poor without accepting any material reward in return. She has been recognized as a humanitarian around the world in various forms: The first Pope John XXIII Peace Prize in 1971; the Jawaharal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1972; the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979; the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1985; and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. 
She was born in 1910 in the former Yugoslavia, and received a calling on a train saying she should go serve the poorest of the poor, a calling, that was recently just celebrated, of nearly 50 years ago. That is when she went to India to start her Missionaries of Charity. 
There are a couple of things that also stand out in my mind. When she received the Nobel Peace Prize she refused a dinner, the banquet that they normally put forward for those who receive that, and asked that the cash equivalent instead be used for money to build more missions and help more people instead of having the lavish dinner. 
I know that in the discussions with her group on the Congressional Gold Medal she suggested that rather than presenting a Congressional Gold Medal to her could they just melt the medal down and give them the equivalent of that in money so they could use that to put up more buildings and help more people of the poorest of the poor. 
You look at some selfless things like that, and you just become amazed at what she did, and, yet, also what she could accomplish when there is that much selflessness that goes into it. 
I think one should recognize all of those accomplishments. And those are just the tip of the iceberg because those speak of kind of the big things that we can identify. But they don't speak of the faces that she has stared into, or the feet that she has washed, and the people she served, one at a time. 
I think that is worthwhile to add into the Record. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the tax cut package being considered before us today. 
Not since 1981 have we been able to offer the American people as comprehensive a tax relief package as we are offering in this tax bill. Through this historic tax bill we will offer American families much needed tax relief in the form of $500 per child tax credit, capital gains tax rate cuts, as well as an increase in the unified credit exemption for death taxes. Families will also be able to save through tax relief for education expenses. 
But this is just the beginning. 
Cutting taxes and shrinking government spending are two things that will help to remove the obstacles that impede the progress of our economy. We must continue to cut taxes even more. 
Current estimates by the Congressional Budget Office place our deficit this year around $45 billion. With a robust economy and continually declining deficits we could easily reach a balanced budget next year--we might even go into surplus for the first time in well over a generation--something that would truly make this budget deal historic. 
In the spending portion of the budget deal the Administration has stated that the amounts agreed to are enough for the operation of the federal government. Although I believe that we need to reduce the size of the federal government even further. 
We have a deal that limits government, we cannot and should not let government grow beyond what we have agreed to here today when revenues exceed the costs of the operation of the federal government. 
The question is now upon us as to what we should do next--what we should do after having achieved the goals so boldly outlined just three short years ago. The debate is no longer about whether we should balance the budget or not--it's not about whether we should cut taxes or not--we have done those things. The debate before us is now in terms of a more limited government with lower taxes. The next question is now that we have agreed on the acceptable size of government what should we do next. 
The short answer is we must continue to cut taxes. 
Surpluses that are generalized either next year or five years from now must be used for further tax reduction. We must make it clear that our priority is to provide Americans with 
as much tax relief as possible--and using surpluses to provide additional tax relief makes that priority clear. Cutting taxes will continue to fuel the economy and will further unleash the potential of our economy to perform at full speed. For too long the Congress has worked to hinder the functioning of our economy by imposing a multilayered tax system that punishes success more than it rewards it. 
We must continue to cut taxes and to make that our priority as we move into the next century. 
Currently, whenever revenues come into the Treasury higher than estimated the revenues automatically go to deficit reduction and will eventually contribute to paying down the Federal debt once we are running a surplus. 
I believe that it is critical that we continue to eliminate the deficit and pay down the debt--but we must do that in the context of lower taxes for the American people. We can do both--we can provide the American taxpayers with much needed tax relief and pay down the debt by allocating excess revenues to both tax reduction and debt reduction. But we must be vigilant in ensuring that excess revenues do not go to more Government spending; they must go to tax cuts and debt reduction alone. 
We must continue to limit the size, scope, and intrusiveness of the Federal Government. We must further limit Government and force its shrinkage through a continuing effort to cut taxes. 
And when we cut the size of Government further we must return the money to the taxpayers who have been forced to subsidize its woefully inefficient operations for much of this century. The taxpayers deserve a break. 
Now, however, we must reject any notions of relaxing at having completed this historic budget deal. Rather, we must pick up again, and begin again, fighting for more tax relief, more tax cuts, and a smaller, less intrusive Federal Government. 
The American people have said they want these things--now we must bind ourselves to provide those things--it would be irresponsible to do otherwise. 
Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this amendment deals with the Advanced Technology Program which was established to spur high-risk precompetitive research and development. It was intended to make U.S. businesses more competitive in the global marketplace by assisting them in developing technologies which they wouldn't fund on their own. 
It was not established to fund research and development which would have been funded in the marketplace anyway. No one believes that the Federal Government should be in the business of taxing American families to subsidize product development, research spending for rich corporations. I think this would be in anybody's definition what former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich qualified and stated was `corporate welfare.' 
I have grave concern that the Advanced Technology Program has become just that, a corporate welfare program. While recognizing the importance of a strong Federal role in research and development, I am very concerned that the ATP program is providing too much money to companies that have clearly adequate resources of their own to fund any research that is worth their doing. 
My amendment is a simple one, and it should have broad bipartisan support. My amendment says that no company with revenues in excess of $2.5 billion--revenues in excess of $2.5 billion--can receive Federal funding through the Advanced Technology Program. We are talking about revenues. This is gross revenues of a company of $2.5 billion--so this is a pretty large company we are talking about--above which you can't receive funding from the Advanced Technology Program. I think if you are having revenues of $2.5 billion or more a year, you can afford to fund your own research and development program, and you don't need the Advanced Technology Program. 
We use the $2.5 billion revenue threshold because it would exclude the 500 largest companies in America, the so-called Fortune 500, from receiving welfare dollars. 
I think if you are a Fortune 500 company, you can do without corporate welfare dollars. In the word of one Silicon Valley executive--and there have been a number out there to support this provision; we have a letter signed by over 100 CEO's from startup companies in Silicon Valley which say terminate the entire ATP program, get rid of the whole thing. We are saying let's hold it to the largest corporations. 
One executive said this: 
If you were General Motors with annual sales of $160 billion and $20 billion in the bank, why don't you fund this great idea yourself and patent it yourself? 
I think the answer to this question is pretty simple, and that is, if there is a Federal subsidy program which will fund corporate R&D for free, even if the company has enough corporate R&D resources, and if that company's competitors are taking the money from the Federal Government, why not take the money from the Federal Government yourself? Therefore, we need to close that loophole so their competitors can't get it and they be forced to take it as well. 
What may be most troublesome is that for every grant given to a huge company with a multibillion-dollar budget and CEO making tens of millions of dollars, there is a small company who may have a good idea but can't raise the capital and will do without Federal assistance. The small companies will do without, while the big corporations get it. What we are saying is let's keep it from going to the megacorporation and have more available to the small corporation, which is what we are trying to target in the first place. 
We are not talking about a program that gives money exclusively to small business, entrepreneurs or inventors working in their garages. Some ATP money goes to small companies and universities. This amendment would make it more available to them. But the top five companies that participate in the greatest dollar volume of grants from the ATP program are some pretty familiar names: IBM, General Motors, General Electric, Ford, Sun Microsystems. I think they can afford to fund these programs on their own. They don't need corporate welfare, and we should be making more of this available to small companies. 
Maybe they get it because they have a great idea or maybe they get it because they have a lobbyist in Washington that watches for these things. That may be part of it as well. Whereas, a small startup company is just busy in their garage, or wherever, trying to hustle enough to make this thing go. We want to make it more available to the small companies, the entrepreneurs and keep it out of the hands of the Fortune 500, all of which have large lobbying staffs to get hold of that here. 
According to the Department of Commerce, more than 40 percent of single-applicant grants currently go to large companies--40 percent. Other ATP recipients are AT&T, Black & Decker, 3M, DuPont, MCI, Xerox, Caterpillar, Kodak, United States Steel, Honeywell, Allied Signal, and the list goes on. These industrial giants have the time and the money to fill out ATP applications, but also have the money to fund these projects on their own. 
I also take this opportunity to commend Secretary Daley for initiating a review of the ATP program. As he and I have discussed, I believe this review is long, long overdue, and I appreciate that it was instigated very early on in his tenure. The Secretary recognized in his recent report on the program that the question of whether huge corporations should participate in ATP grants to the exclusion of some smaller ventures is a legitimate concern and one that he is concerned about as well. As a result of the Secretary's review, he has proposed changes in the match for single-applicant-large companies to a 60-40 match from the current 50-50 and encourage joint ventures over single applicants. 
That is a laudable start, but, my goodness, that is just not far enough when we are talking about a company that has $2.5 billion in revenues, huge companies. They can afford to do this on their own. It just doesn't go far enough. At most, this would reduce the amount a large company will receive in grants by $65,000 a year, and that is not much of an incentive for companies like IBM with revenues of $76 billion annually. 
To its credit, this year the Department of Commerce requested input from the public on the ATP. Among the public responses were, listen to this one: 
ATP awards large companies even though a smaller company, as a single applicant, may have a better technical and business proposal. In some cases, the large company tries to get the award in a new research file just to shelf the idea and prevent someone from doing the research because it will compete with its existing markets. 
Another one: 
ATP should not be a time-consuming, expensive proposal preparation contest which it is now. 
Another one: 
ATP does not provide much assistance for individuals or shoestring startups which need assistance most. 
While I am not offering an amendment to kill this program today, I do have grave concerns about it primarily because I believe there is ample private capital for good ideas. Last year alone, the venture capital industry pumped more than $10 billion into new ventures. Last year, companies raised more than $50 billion from initial public stock offerings. The top four winners of ATP grants invested more than $20 billion of their own corporate resources on research and development. We are talking about a total program, the total ATP program of right around or under $300 million. 
I don't think I have the support this year to eliminate this program on an appropriations bill. Many of my colleagues believe that would be more appropriate for the authorizing process, which I think would be as well and a good place to do it as well. 
So let me reiterate, today I am not offering a killer amendment. This isn't even an amendment to reduce the funding of this program. It does nothing to the funding of ATP. I am offering an amendment which will make a small change in the program to better enable it to meet its mission of providing funds for high-technology research without replacing private dollars. 
I want to note something else, Mr. President, if I can, about people applying for ATP grants and companies that are applying for ATP grants. This is according to a GAO report when they were looking at whether people try to find these first outside the Government. This is the GAO:  
When we asked if they had searched for funding from other sources before applying to ATP, we found that 63 percent of the applicants said they had not-- 
Sixty-three percent-- [and] 65 percent of the winners had not looked for funding before applying to ATP. 
In other words, they are going first right to the Federal Government, to the ATP program. These are huge corporations with over $2.5 billion in revenues, the only ones we are targeting, and they are saying, `Let us take it there first.' 
This is a simple amendment and will help the small entrepreneur. It will bring some sanity back to the process. It will start to address the issue of corporate welfare, and this is a perfect case. 
So, Mr. President, I think this is an appropriate amendment. At the appropriate time, I will urge its adoption and ask for the yeas and nays. I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to rise in response to some of the statements made by the Senator from South Carolina. I deeply appreciate his heart, of where it is about what we need to do to make America a stronger economy, to keep jobs, growth, high technology, and jobs growing and prospering in the United States. I think his heart is clearly in the right place and he wants to do the right thing. 
I just think in a nation this big, with an economy this size, with the dynamism that we have in this country, you can't control it out of Washington. That is why the President pronounced, over a year ago, that the era of big Government is over. It seems to me that was an admission that things have changed to the point that you just can't direct all things, and all wisdom doesn't come out of Washington. 
This program is one of those that we are talking about in that particular area. You are basically talking about a program here where you are going to pick winners and losers out of Washington. We have an application process that takes place here. You apply for this and give us your good idea, and we in Washington are going to think about it and see if we think you deserve to get this money or not. If your technology is one we are interested in and if we think this technology is good for our future, then we will decide to give it to you. We will decide those sort of issues from Washington. 
I am not even talking about the overall program here. As I mentioned, and as Senator Gregg has mentioned as well, this is actually a strengthening amendment. We are just saying, if you are a Fortune 500 company and have revenues of over $2.5 billion a year, we are not going to make this program available to you. You are going to have to be, at least, a startup company, because the larger companies do have lobbyists here in Washington, as the Senator from South Carolina knows. They are always coming around looking for things for their companies, as they should be. Many of their companies take it because their competitor takes this. Let's remove that as an opportunity and remove this area of corporate 
welfare, which truly is corporate welfare. 
Now I would like to clear up a couple of other points on this, if we could. One is that I am afraid, too, that some of these programs qualify in the area--we put out a big press release saying this program is going to solve all the problems of technology drifting abroad, and we are going to solve all of the problems of not having good, high-wage, high-skill jobs in the United States because we have the Advanced Technology Program. This will solve all of those problems. This will do it. I think we suffer here from a concept of having a big press release and a very small program to answer that. 
Listen once again to the figures. We are talking about a program of $200 million. That is a large sum of money, but if you look at what venture capital put into new startups last year alone, which was $10 billion, this is 2 percent of what was put into this from just venture capital. And I add initial public offerings on to that, where people go to the marketplace to raise capital for a good idea, and that was $50 billion. We are talking about less than 2 percent in this particular program. 
If we really want to help business in America--which I think the Senator from South Carolina clearly wants to do; he wants business to stay here in America, to grow in America, and he wants business to prosper--well, then let's do some things that would actually help business: cut taxation, regulation and litigation and manipulation out of Washington. Let's cut capital gains tax rates. 
I was just in the Silicon Valley, one of the key areas in this country where startup companies are flourishing with new ideas and products that are going global rapidly. I was there and talking about the Advanced Technology Program. I have a letter, as I mentioned, signed by over 100 CEO's of startup companies saying, `Do away with this corporate welfare.' That is what they called it. These are the people who, arguably, this program started for. They said:  
We don't want you directing it because you move too slow; Washington moves too slow in trying to figure out what is taking place in the global marketplace. It can't react fast enough; it can't figure these out. You are going back and basically taking taxpayer dollars from the startup companies to fund more stodgy, slower moving items, many of which end up going to the private market. If you want to help us, cut the capital gains rates; do something about the litigation; as we try to raise capital in this marketplace, do something about the regulatory regime where we have 50 different entities regulating us. Much of that is needed, but can you make it more simplified? What about all the manipulation where you are trying to direct, by the Tax Code, everything we do every day. 
Then they gave a great example which I thought was wonderful. There is a little startup company in the Silicon Valley that raised over $300 million in capital. That is more than the Advanced Technology Program. We are talking about $200 million in this program. They raised that much. I was speaking to a group of people about 5 miles away from this startup company that raised $300 million. I was talking to a crowd of about 100 people there. I asked them, `Have any of you heard of this company?' I gave the name of the company. This was a group of 100 people, 5 miles a way. This company has actually raised more money than is in the ATP Program. One person there out of the 100 had heard of it. That is a substantial amount of money, but it is not large compared to the amount of capital being raised and is needed. 
If we really want to do something, let's help the overall atmosphere and not try to direct it. As I want to point out yet again, look at what we are talking about with this amendment. We are saying that if you are a Fortune 500 company, if you have over $2.5 billion in revenues, we think you can find enough capital on your own to fund ideas you think are good. Let's target it for the startup companies. That is what we are supposed to be after with this. These large companies, when they have an idea they want to pursue, have the ability to be able to pursue it. That is how you deal with this issue. If we want to really help corporate America, we have a great chance coming up to cut capital gains and deal with litigation reform, and we can actually do something real. 
So those are my responses. I know the Senator from South Carolina has his heart in the right place and his concepts are clear in his mind. If we really want to help them--and I have been there and talked with them--target this and cut it away from the Fortune 500 companies. 
Mr. President, I do ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment, and I believe there is some discussion about holding this vote until 2:45.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 that we are considering today allocates $35 million in the administration's budget request for research on the public health effects of airborne particulate matter. I have an amendment that simply states that these studies employ some basic sound scientific methods. This is an extremely important provision, but I would withdraw my amendment, if we could engage in a colloquy to assure that the issue will be addressed in conference. 
This language will be an important part of assuring that we protect public health. Last week, the EPA finalized its rule on particulate matter. Many have questioned the science behind this rule and a great deal of uncertainty exists over the effect of particulate matter on public health. As we reach this juncture, we must remember the reason for this standard: to enhance public health. The only way we can be sure that the standard will, in fact, provide the desired benefits is through sound science. Lacking sound science, we may end up with standards that don't provide any benefit, but cost the public dearly. While we often hear about costs on industry, we must remember that those costs are passed down to individuals in the form of higher prices and higher State and local taxes. When individuals truly gain significant benefits from a standard, they are indeed better off. However, if we raise their costs for nothing or little in return, we simply make them poorer and less able to pay for basic necessities, such as health care. Last week you may recall, one District of Columbia woman died in her apartment because of the heat and the fact that she could not afford air conditioning. Such stories remind us that poverty represents one of the greatest risk to public health. Hence, we should make sure that new regulations do not simply make people poorer. If we don't pursue sound science, we may impose regulations that actually decrease public health. By demanding that particulate matter research relies on the best available scientific methods, we can gain better knowledge over the impacts of the regulations and reform them to assure that we are actually enhancing overall public health.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Missouri for recognizing the importance of these studies and my recommendation. Given the significance of this research and overall limitations on funding, I think it is important that we are assured that the research will include those studies 
that will help us determine whether a cause-effect relationship exists between exposure to particulate matter and adverse health impacts. These include: First, controlled inhalation studies that will allow us to determine the effects of exposure to particulate matter at different concentration levels and the mechanism by which particulate matter could affect health; second, prospective epidemiology studies based on individual exposure measurements that will allow us to better examine the role of possible alternative causes of the measured increase in risk; and third, the relationship of outdoor, indoor, and personal exposures to particulate matter. Without these types of studies, we may not be any further along in resolving the scientific uncertainties associated with this rulemaking. I further believe that the results of this research should be made available for independent scientific review.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I also believe it is important that the research program include funding for the reanalysis of the American Cancer Society study on particulate matter that was used as the basis for EPA's risk estimate. My understanding is that the Health Effects Institute, an independent research organization that is already reviewing some of the epidemiology data, is willing to undertake this reanalysis and has received permission from the American Cancer Society, but currently lacks adequate funding to do a complete reanalysis.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I would like to say that the amendment that was just agreed to was to eliminate the cost-of-living adjustment for the Members of Congress. 
I think it is important that at this time when we are seeking to balance the budget, we not be seen as giving ourselves a pay raise, to be able to establish this as an important issue. I do not say that Members are overpaid, because I do not believe they are. But I do think we are moving forward to balance this budget, and we need to show leadership by not receiving this COLA. And that is why I put this amendment forward. I am very appreciative that the author of the first-degree amendment, the manager of the bill, has agreed to it and that it has been accepted. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. For the information of all Members, today the Senate will resume consideration of S. 955, the foreign operations appropriations bill. Under the previous order, following the debate time on the remaining two amendments to S. 955, the Senate will begin voting on those amendments as well as final passage. Therefore, Senators can expect three consecutive rollcall votes beginning at approximately 10 a.m. this morning. 
It is the intention of the majority leader for the Senate to begin consideration of the Treasury, postal appropriations bill following the disposition of the foreign operations appropriations bill. Members can anticipate additional rollcall votes today on the Treasury, postal appropriations bill. 
The majority leader has also stated that the Senate will resume consideration of the nomination of Joel Klein to be an Assistant Attorney General. Senators can expect a rollcall vote on that nomination following the conclusion of the remaining 3 hours for debate. 
I thank all Senators for their attention, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to legislation that I believe could have a substantial positive impact on United States commerce. For several months now, my colleagues on the Commerce Committee have been working to forge an agreement that will deregulate ocean shipping and allow our exporters to compete on a more level playing field with our foreign competitors. S. 414, The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1997, would bring much-needed reform to the shipping industry by injecting a higher degree of competition into the current conference-dominated system of ocean shipping. It would also end federal government tariff filing with the Federal Maritime Commission and I believe that this is a significant step toward reducing red tape in this industry. 
First of all, I want to commend those Senators who have played an active role in writing and furthering this important legislation. Senators Hutchison, Gorton, Lott, and Breaux have worked diligently to achieve a consensus among the diverse interests in the shipping industry, and I know that is no small task. I also want to commend Senator McCain and his staff, who have endeavored to find common ground with all affected parties by working openly and holding numerous meetings. The result of this work is an important piece of legislation on which I hope the Senate will be able to focus its attention in the near future. 
I care about this legislation because it could have a tremendous impact on the agriculture industry which is, of course, vitally important to Kansas. Exporting is critical to the agriculture industry--overall, forty percent of what we grow in the U.S. is consumed overseas. Moreover, exports will play an increasingly important role in agriculture because any growth in the industry will primarily come from exports. As the incomes of people in many developing countries increase, they are able to afford a higher quality, more diversified diet--and the U.S. stands ready to provide it. And, the fastest growing category of agricultural commodities for export are high-value products, such as meat and vegetables, which are transported in ocean containers--the type of ocean transportation that is affected by this legislation. 
Transportation costs are a particularly important factor in achieving agricultural exports because transportation typically comprises a larger proportion of the final cost of the good than for other industries. In fact, transportation is often the single largest component of the delivered cost of the good, accounting for as much as 50 percent of total landed cost. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the agriculture industry alone spends more than four billion dollars each year in containerized shipping, and that this price includes a premium attributable to conference market power which is 18 percent of the cost of transportation. In a business where sales are made or lost based on pennies per pound, this is the difference between the U.S. or our competitors making the sale. And, given that every $1 in agricultural exports generates an additional $1.50 in economic activity, the importance of S. 414 for not only the agriculture industry, but the U.S. economy as a whole, is clear.

<DOCNO>105-brownback-ks-3-19970716</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to S. 955. 
This amendment deals with the United States policy for the south Caucasus and Central Asia, an area of the world that was once crisscrossed by the ancient Silk Road, which includes the countries--I have a map here for Senators to be able to look at--of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. This amendment deals with these countries. 
These countries are very vital and important countries at a crossroads in their development. They are, as I mentioned, along the ancient Silk Road, if people can imagine and conjure up those images of that area of the world and the importance it has had in the past and the importance it now has and will continue to have for U.S. policy. We have vital political, social and economic interests there, and they need to be acted on before it is too late. 
They are independent for the first time in almost a century. They are located at the juncture of many of today's major world forces, and they are all rich in natural resources. And they are looking west for the first time. They are emerging after nearly a century of being plundered by a Communist regime. While actively taking out their resources, the Soviets put little back. These countries now find themselves free to govern themselves. 
Again, as I stated earlier, they are looking west. The very fact that they have had little experience with independence, and that their economies are essentially starting from scratch, leaves them in a precarious situation, which is all the more precarious because of their geographic location. 
Consider this: They are placed between the empire from which they recently declared independence and an extremist Islamic regime to the south--both of which have a strong interest in exerting economic and political pressure upon them. 
All of the Silk Road countries are currently seeking U.S. investment and encouragement, and are looking to us to participate actively in working out regional political, economic and strategic cooperation. 
Mr. President, we should be actively responding to their appeals. We have now the opportunity to spread freedom and democratic ideals in a region historically dominated by Russia and Iran. The doors are open to promote institutions of democratic government and create the conditions for the growth of pluralistic societies and religious tolerance. These countries are a major force in containing the spread northward of anti-Western Islamic extremism. So far, these nations remain largely open to us. 
I would also like to point out something else that is important about this region: that is the Caspian Sea overlapping the territory of the South Caucasus and Central Asia that is rich in natural resources as I mentioned earlier. 
I have another chart here I would like to show you to illustrate the energy resources which exist in the Caspian Sea area right here. If people would look at this chart, this is `Worldwide Undiscovered Resource Potential of Oil and Gas'. You have the Middle East and Russia, the two leaders, and then the Caspian Sea area is potentially the third largest in the world, some say up to $4 trillion worth of oil and gas in this region, creating significant interest for economic ties and investments as well. The United States should do everything possible to promote the sovereignty and independence as well as encourage solid diplomatic and economic cooperation between these nations. 
In order to do that, we need to take a number of positive steps. No. 1, we should be strong and active in helping resolve local conflicts. No. 2, we should be providing economic assistance to provide positive incentives for international private investment and increased trade. No. 3, we should be assisting in the development of the infrastructure necessary for communication, transportation, energy and trade on an East-West access. No. 4, we should be providing assistance to help fight the scourge of narcotics trafficking, weapons of mass destruction, organized crime and No. 5, perhaps the most important of all, we should be supplying all the assistance possible to strengthen democracy and tolerance and the development of civil society. 
These are the best ways to remain sure that these countries will grow in independence and move strongly toward open and free government. Our time to focus on this region is now, to keep them from spreading into an area or being infiltrated by the spread of the anti-Western fundamentalism that is in this region of the world. That is why I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
I believe it has been worked out with both the majority and the minority staff to agree to this amendment. I ask that the amendment be agreed to. 
Mr. President, I urge its adoption.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to this bill that would require the Clinton administration to improve the manner in which the State Department and our intelligence agencies monitor and publicize cases of religious persecution and human rights abuses. 
Persecution of people of faith has been on the rise around the world. Governments throughout the world have been denying people the fundamental right of freedom of religion, a fundamental right upon which this country was built. 
As a matter of policy, the United States should be doing all it can to bring religious persecution and other human rights violations to an end. One problem we face, however, is that we do not have an accurate accounting of the extent to which many governments persecute people of faith. We do not know the number of prisoners nor do we even have all the names of those prisoners. What we need is an accurate accounting of religious persecution. We need the administration to devote greater resources to monitoring religious persecution and to informing the Congress, as well as the American people, about such instances. 
We also need to encourage a formal dialog with countries throughout the world to bring religious persecution to an end. Specifically, my amendment would do the following: Require a religious persecution report modeled on the State Department human rights report; require the establishment of a prison information registry; require the President to devote greater intelligence resources to gathering information regarding human rights abuses and acts of religious persecution; and encourage the administration to work with other nations to establish a Commission on Security and Cooperation in Asia which would be modeled after the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
Mr. President, the U.S. Government has a responsibility to provide the public a better understanding of the extent to which nations violate this basic right of their citizens. My amendment would move us in this direction. I ask that my amendment be adopted.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feingold amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, and associate myself with the Senator's comments. 
I would like to note first that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], has done an outstanding job in representing his State in the work he has done on this particular project, and I realize I come late to this project and this proposal that he has worked on for a number of years. But as a new Senator looking at it, I have some questions about this particular project and this particular proposal, and that is why I join in this amendment. I know it has gone on for some period of time, and this has been a fight that has existed for some long period of time. But I think there are some questions that need to be answered. I think we have now started to take some of the tentative steps toward resolving those issues. 
No. 1, this ought to be scrutinized by the authorizing committee rather than going through the appropriations process. That seems to be the legitimate way to go for us. It should first and foremost proceed through the authorizing committee, and this will give us a chance to better develop an alternative plan. 
There are significant environmental questions regarding the issue of this particular project. Those have been in existence for some period of time, and they are the product of a lot of these studies that have been going on, and yet they still remain. There is a great deal of division about the impact on the environment, the impact on endangered species. That is why it seems to me, again, it is wise to go back to the authorizing committee, to have an authorization process to take place with this particular bill. 
That is what this amendment does. It directs the Department of Interior to take certain steps toward what will lead to a legally binding agreement that will secure the tribes' water rights and will enable us to make certain that our tax dollars are spent wisely and we keep any environmental impacts small. So I agree with the Senator from Wisconsin that while these are very difficult things to do because there is a lot at stake in what various people want for their particular States, for their particular areas, in looking at these projects they may well at the end of the day prove to be very wise projects. This one, I think, has proceeded in the wrong fashion. It needs to go back to the authorizing committee. I think the amendment we have put forward here has some strong bipartisan support. It is a sensible project. It does not kill the project. It simply says let us go back and take it through the right and appropriate steps. I think that is prudent in answering the difficult questions that exist. 
So I rise in support of this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.  
Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today there is some excellent news regarding the economy. The deficit, because of such a strong economy and taxes being paid, may be as low as $45 billion. I am hopeful that we can continue to keep that economy going strong by some of the tax cuts that are being proposed and are currently being negotiated. I think the real story here of what is taking place on balancing this budget is the fact that the economy is growing. Growth works, and it works well, and it is working well for us here. 
I think it would be a mistake if we did not step forward and do whatever we can to continue this economy and this economic expansion that has been one of the longest running expansions we have had in history to date. That is why some of the tax cuts, particularly the progrowth and profamily tax cuts, the capital gains tax cut and the $500 per child tax credit are very, very important for us to continue, not only to balance the budget and not only to do it before the year 2002, or do it by the year 2000, but to start to pay off the debt. I think it is important we do it. 
I also note that while the economy is doing well and we are getting the deficit under control--and those are important things--we certainly need some help in our culture overall. We continue to have terribly high rates of crime taking place in this society. We had in Washington, DC three people in a coffee shop murdered. We continue to have story after story, it seems like, on a daily basis of cultural problems that we are having just throughout society. Whether it is the number of children born out of wedlock, teenage suicide, cultural decline in total, violent crime rates or disintegration of the family, we really have to step it up in these areas.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one thing I want to draw people's attention to is that in the third week of October, there is going to be a `Character Counts' week taking place. That may be a while off and is not necessary for us to focus on now, but I think it is time that while we look at economic activity being strong and culturally we are having all these problems, let's focus on these things. 
The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has been a major champion of character counts, and that is where people step up and say, `We need to look at ourselves and our own character.' Good character doesn't come about by accident, it is a practice of virtue. It is one thing that each and every one of us as Americans can step forward with. 
I would like to, as we close today, give one example of a person who stepped up on character, and it is a gentleman in Wichita, KS, in my home State, by the name of Leo Mendoza. Leo is a man who knows that character counts, because he hasn't always had it. 
Leo is a survivor of sexual abuse, alcohol abuse, drug abuse and crime. For 17 years, he was in and out of jail, on and off drugs and in and out of marriages. 
But today, after years of soul-searching and counseling, he is, once again, a solid citizen. He is an elder at his church, and he and his wife are trying to adopt a child. 
What changed Leo? Was it Government rehabilitation programs? Was it a Government social program? Or was it actually something deeper, something that the Government could neither teach nor instill? 
Leo actually never relied on a Government assistance program, partly out of pride, partly out of independence. He never even sought help from others. It was his friends who sought him. 
In 1987, a friend of his introduced him to Alcoholics Anonymous and a local church. 
Slowly, he began to form the rudiments of character, promising himself that he would confront the daily struggles of life with the firmness that a life of true character is built not on one heroic act, but rather is the consequence of a thousand little struggles. Leo, together with his family, friends, and church, began to rehabilitate. He had the courage to say no, the patience to endure the temptations and the humility to ask God for help when weakness was about to overcome him. 
By struggling with his past, Leo learned virtue, and by learning virtue, he built character. 
Those struggles teach us about our own character and about what true character is made of. 
I give that little vignette as we close today because in attacking the cultural decline and difficulties in this society, this is not something you legislate with massive Government programs or is not something we can sit in a conference room to decide what we are going to do and impose that will upon the country. But rather it is the little individual struggles that each and every one of us has everyday. It is each and every struggle that 250 million-plus Americans deal with. That is how you make a great Nation, people struggling to build character, by building that virtue and struggling to build it one at a time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to speak briefly in favor of the Dorgan-Lott second-degree amendment and associate myself with that amendment. I do think it is important before we go forward with additional BRAC's that we know and can certify the amount of money that has been saved by prior BRAC rounds. I do not think we have taken that into consideration. There is a lot that is also associated with closure costs. 
But more to the point on this particular issue, it seems to me that we have been through this BRAC process here now for several rounds, and some of that may have been very healthy to do, but that we ought to stop and appraise just what was good about that, and, more importantly, I think we need to go through a BRAC on domestic discretionary spending. Let us look at some of the programs that are discretionary programs, not entitlement programs but discretionary programs, say, within the Department of Commerce or, say, within the Department of Energy. Let us go through a BRAC there. Let us take a look at those and have a vote up or down. We ought to be focusing our effort there where we know we have some wasteful programs. We know there is money that is being wasted and spent not for a good reason or cause. 
We have gone through that on some of the military bases as far as looking at some bases that may not be necessary to have, but would it not be so much wiser now to focus on some of these discretionary programs? They are in the media virtually every day--the Advanced Technology Program being a corporate welfare program, for one instance. We have other programs that have been identified. We have a fleet of ships under the Commerce Department that we have been saying for a long time ought to be privatized rather than being run there. That is a wasteful spending program. I have a list of those that I think we ought to go through far before we start up some other BRAC round in the military when we do not even know what sort of cost or what sort of savings we have had associated within it. 
So, Mr. President, I just think we have a lot better things that we could be doing with our time and focus on rather than going back through a BRAC round. I do think it is constructive, through the Dorgan-Lott approach, to get a sense of where we are costwise, get a sense of what cost we have with closing a military base, get a strategy going here which guarantees that further base closures will not jeopardize national security. We need to look at all those things before we go forward with another BRAC round. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Senator Kohl and I have offered this amendment. It is a very, very simple amendment. It just says if we are going to break the spending caps on this bill, on this budget agreement that we've told the American people is going to balance the budget, if we're going to break the spending limits on it, we have to vote on it. And we have to vote and pass that by a 60-vote margin. That's it. 
The President has to say how he is going to get us to a balanced budget. If we're going to break that cap, he has to say how he is going to get us to a balanced budget; if we're going to break that spending cap, he has to say where we're going to make the spending cuts, and we have to vote if we are going to break it. 
I think this is the least we can do for the American people. It says, `Folks, we meant it when we said we were going to balance the budget. We meant it when we said we're going to balance it by the year 2002.' And if we are going to break it, we've got to break it by a 60-vote margin. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kohl.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like to quickly respond, if I could, to just a couple of comments. I hope we will not stand here and say that the welfare program, the changes that we made in the last Congress have been a failure. They have been a great success. Look in my home State of Kansas where welfare rolls have gone down 30 percent. And, yes, we have had a strong economy, but in the past we have had a strong economy when the welfare rolls have gone up. You have to change the incentives in the program. That is what we did in the last Congress. It was a positive step to move forward. So I hope that we do not make something a failure when it has been a strong success and people are working now rather than receiving payments from the Government and they are having more self-confidence themselves. 
I think this is good for people, too, because with the past system the people on welfare, along with the people that paid for welfare, thought it was a horrible failure and a horrible system. We have changed the dynamics, and we have changed the incentives in this program to where the people are incentivized to work. And they feel good about it. They feel better about it. And this is a program that is going to work. 
I think there are a lot of things we could spend money on that might well be good, but we have tended to do a lot of that in the past, to the point we are over $5 trillion in the hole. So that we just cannot keep voting for everything to be able to do it or else we are not going to get in balance.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the comments of the Senator from Michigan where he was addressing a foreign policy concern, and that is China. 
Yesterday, the House voted on most-favored-nation status and extended that status toward China even though we are having a great deal of difficulty in that country, and I do think we need to take additional steps in addressing this issue of China and our relationships back and forth. 
We have had problems with that nation expanding weapons of mass destruction, selling them to some of our enemies that we have around the world, particularly Iran. We have had problems with religious persecution, with forced abortion in that nation, and I think we need to step up and pass the issue of MFN. 
The Senator from Michigan has a start in his bill when he is talking about some different areas where we can put pressure on that nation in our relationship there to encourage more religious freedom taking place and to discourage things like weapons proliferation.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Madam President. I first want to congratulate the Senator from Delaware for an excellent bill he has put forward on an important topic. We are finally talking about tax cuts, something we should have been talking about for a long period of time, but we haven't since 1981. This is a great day. I think it is a great opening that we are finally doing something about the tax burden on the American people, where they are paying over 40 percent of their income in taxes. I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee for raising this. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, we have had some good discussions here. Looking at the overall tax cut bill that we have, which I think is very important that we do, I am congratulatory toward the chairman. 
I chair the District of Columbia Subcommittee. We have really been looking strong at what we need to do in the District of Columbia to make us a shining city. The chairman has done an extraordinary job of including things like zeroing out capital gains on real property in the District of Columbia, something I think we ought to look at nationwide, but let us try it here first. 
We also have in there a provision for new homeowners and new home buyers, a $5,000 tax credit provision in there for new home buyers in the District of Columbia to attract people back to Washington, DC, to make it a shining city. 
Unfortunately, there is one other provision, section 602, in the bill that creates an economic development corporation--requires the creation of an economic development corporation--in order to access some of the tax credits. I have great difficulty with this entity. It is something that would have to be created by the District of Columbia Committee. It is an entity that would have condemnation authority. It is an entity that would have a broad base of authority, appointed by the President. It is in effect going to be a department of commerce for the District of Columbia with a lot more authority and a lot more power. 
I do not think that survives the Byrd rule test, and I raise the point of order on section 602 of Senate bill 949 under the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, the Byrd rule provision, because I believe these are extraneous. I think this is an ill-conceived concept even though I am very supportive of what the chairman has done overall for the District of Columbia. He is stepping up to solve the problem. But I do not think this provision is the way to go. I do raise a point of order under the Byrd rule to that particular provision, section 602.

I applaud that effort and will work with his staff to see if we can resolve particular concerns that he has before a vote tomorrow.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I rise today, while we are just about to finish up on this historic State Department reorganization bill, to say a couple of things about it and the people who have been involved. 
I was in the House of Representatives on the Foreign Affairs Committee where we started the attempt to reorganize the State Department. We were able to pass it through, and the bill got vetoed by the President. I think that is what is historic and taking place here. 
We are now working together to do the thing we need to do, which is to make the overall operation run more efficiently, to eliminate some of the apparatus created by the cold war, and to try to create a foreign policy agency and a setup that is more forward looking, more organized, and that I think can represent our interests better in this post-cold-war atmosphere. 
I think it is a real tribute to the people who have been involved in this that we have been able to get this done. Overhauling the American foreign policy bureaucracy needed to be done, and this bill will abolish agencies and bureaus born of the cold war imperatives that are no longer necessary. Achievement was hard won and something the American people can be proud of. Now we can reduce the size of the Federal Government, something I have certainly long supported. I want to thank those people involved. 
There are two other things I want to quickly note that have taken place in here as well. I chair the Middle East Subcommittee. One of the things we have been focused on is how do we contain some of the radical elements of that region that seek to terrorize us around the world? One of the things that is contained in this bill is Radio Free Iran, and that will be broadcast into the Iranian airwaves to send forward clear and accurate information about what is taking place around the rest of the world. 
I think this is a very important tool that we can use to be able to work with the Iranian people, who are some of the most repressed around the world. They have recently voted to elect a more moderate leader, yet most have said they will not really be able to express what they want to do because the leader they elected will not have the power or the authority to get that done. 
Yet, I think we can continue to fight for the Iranian people by putting forward good information, true information, of how much we support what they are doing on the cause in the battle of freedom. I think Radio Free Iran will be a very helpful signal, something important, as we move forward in working to contain those terroristic elements in the world that seek to do us harm and seek harm in much of the rest of the world. 
Also, I look forward in the future to encouraging other countries to further engage with us in initiatives to expand democracy, free markets and capitalism around the world. I look forward in the future to working with Central Asian countries to link them more with the democracies and the democracy movement and free markets that are gaining strength all around the world. Some dub this a silk road strategy, and I think it is important that we do this in moving forward a positive agenda, not just one that is always negative toward others but one that is very open and positive toward encouraging the rest of the world. 
I look forward to working with other chairmen, including Chairman Smith, also on the Foreign Relations Committee, as we seek to open up the Central Asian regions to further democracy, to free markets, to capitalism, to liberty. 
I think that is a good move on our part. Part of it is going to be contained in the future of the world. Radio Free Iran is in this bill and I think that is a positive move. It doesn't diminish the act of privatizing Radio Free Europe. It is important to move forward in that regard. This is a win for the American people, and a win for people around the world who seek freedom for themselves and their marketplace, their future and their families. With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am proud today to be offering a bipartisan proposal for campaign finance reform with my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Wisconsin, Herb Kohl. 
Mr. President, those of us who have spent the balance of our congressional careers working to build public trust in the political system know of the difficulties in offering constructive alternatives. Any legislation which fundamentally alters the way public officials seek election is bound to attract their attention and intense scrutiny--as it should. 
Mr. President, Senator Kohl and I believe this proposal offers a hopeful avenue for progress. Recognizing that any reform effort must be bipartisan to succeed, the legislation we are offering establishes a fair and independent process to bring this issue to the floor of the Congress for consideration. Without prejudging any outcomes, this bill would help to break the logjam which threatens to prevent even meaningful consideration of alternatives for reform. 
Mr. President, Senator Kohl and I do not claim to have all the answers, but we believe that through this vehicle, we can take the next step in accomplishing substantial progress on this important matter.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one of my highest priorities as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, is to make sure the children in the Nation's capital are receiving the quality education they deserve. The District's public schools, unfortunately, have failed too many students in providing the education they deserve. The District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997 would change this by giving low-income students the chance to get the education they need. 
Our subcommittee held a hearing a few weeks ago to explore options to improve public education in the District. Mr. President, I know there are schools which are working and where students are thriving in their learning environment. I had the privilege to visit Stuart-Hobson Middle School. I was impressed by the success of the program at Stuart-Hobson and how the students took pride in their education. This school, however, is one of a few exceptions in the District Public School System. 
The facts about the District public schools speak for themselves: only 22 percent of fourth grade students are at or above basic reading achievement levels; students on average consistently score below the national average of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; students consistently score below the national Scholastic Aptitude Test [SAT]. We cannot continue to trap these students in an educational system that is failing them. 
Gen. Julius Becton, chief executive officer and Superintendent of the District of Columbia Public Schools, and the District of Columbia Emergency Transitional School Board of Trustees have said that they will make significant improvements by the year 2000, and I recognize and respect the work that lies ahead of them. But, Mr. President, the year 2000 is 3 school years away. In 3 school years, a child progresses through grades one through three in which they learn to read, write, add, subtract, etc. In 3 school years, a high school student gains the skills and preparation they need for college or for a job. These 3 school years are too valuable to trap these students in the public school system that has not delivered. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator Coats and Senator Lieberman in introducing this legislation that focuses on the individual student in the District of Columbia Public Schools. By providing up to $3,200 in individual scholarships to low-income families who will choose the school for their children, this bill would give these students the chance to make sure the next 3 school years do not go to waste. Improving the chances for these children to get the education they need is one of the most fundamental elements to restore the Nation's capital into the shining city the United States deserves.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Senator Kohl and I have a great deal of concern about getting some enforcement mechanisms put into place during reconciliation so that the budget agreement that is reached, if it is passed, is then enforced. It is in the reconciliation of the bill. That is what this amendment will do. We need to work together during reconciliation to enforce the targets that have been established. 
Madam President, this is a hopeful budget deal. We must hope that we do not have one slight downturn in the economy. We must hope that we did not make one flawed assumption, and we must hope that we don't have a national emergency. 
Madam President, no matter how well intended things may be, things don't always work out the way you hope they will. If any one of these hopeful events don't occur, then the budget won't be balanced. This is why Senator Kohl and I are offering this sense-of-the-Senate amendment. 
This budget deal was only made possible because the night before the agreement, CBO found an extra $225 billion in revenues. 
This deal assumes we will be able to achieve 72 percent of the savings in the last 2 years with more than half occurring in the last year. 
And because these numbers are so fragile and ever-changing at best, and because this budget promises to balance without much real fiscal restraint, it is imperative that we enact strong budget enforcement reforms to assure that the goals of this deal are reached. 
We cannot simply rely on hope to end this cycle of debt we are passing onto our children. To make balancing the budget a reality, this deal needs teeth. We need to strengthen this deal by at least enforcing it. 
This amendment does not change any numbers, it does not alter any of the goals of this agreement. It only says that Congress should put in place tools to make sure this deal is honored. 
What is in the amendment? 
This amendment requires that this summer the Budget Committee report a bill that requires: That every year the President sends Congress a budget that complies with this agreement; that the budget adopted by Congress complies with this agreement; provides that if the deficit is below the targets set out in this budget that the money is not spent, rather it shall be saved; that emergency spending is paid for; and this amendment establishes legal procedures that will assure that the goals of this agreement are reached.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues today to introduce the District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act, a bill which would jumpstart the District's economy and set in motion a commercial, social, and cultural renaissance that will once again make all Americans proud of their Capital. 
I am delighted to find that the District's City Council shares my belief that the enactment of this legislation will be very good for the city. On May 9, 1997, in a resolution to accompany its qualified endorsement of the administration's bailout plan, the Council stated that `. . . the District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act . . . would provide the jolt that is desperately needed to expand the District's revenue base by reversing the hemorrhaging of residents and jobs from the District.' 
Although this legislation represents a good start toward the resolution of the city's problems, much more needs to be done. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring and the District of Columbia, I have just concluded 2 months of oversight hearings on the District's many problems, including the poor performance of the schools, the high crime rate, and the city's reputation for low quality services. While each of these problems are being addressed in some fashion by the Control Board, they are far from being solved, and the city remains desperately in need of a renewal of its spirit. 
In the coming weeks I will be exploring with my colleagues, with city officials, and with the administration a series of additional reform options that will help lead to this renewal, and to the recreation of a Capital City worthy of a great Nation.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from Pennsylvania leading this critical dialog that we are having. I note my appreciation for what the Democrat leader is putting forward, and appreciation as well for his discussion, what he is saying, that what we need to be talking about is limiting abortion. I think folks should note the change that is taking place. We are finally talking about stopping the destruction from occurring here. We are finally addressing that, rather than saying let us continue and let us continue the growth of that. I appreciate his efforts in putting that forward. 
I would note, the American Medical Association has said that this is not a needed procedure at all, the partial-birth abortion procedure. This is not a needed procedure. Regardless of the statements of the Senator from Illinois or others, this is not a necessary procedure. Indeed, it is a heinous procedure. The partial-birth abortion is something that pricks our conscience because we cannot even stand the concept of it for pets or for animals, let alone for children and for babies in this country or any other country around the world. 
But, if I could, I would like to stand here and sound a hopeful note for us, us as a people, us as a nation, we as a body as the U.S. Senate. I want to stand here and sound a hopeful note because it seems to me we are finally talking about and starting to really wrestle with one of those things that has been one of the parts of the decline in the American culture. I have shown these 
charts before, but I want to show them during this debate because I think they are an important part about this debate, about what has happened to the American culture during the past 30 years. 
Look at this chart. This is about child abuse and neglect reports in the United States since 1976. This is about children being abused, being neglected in America. We had a lot in 1976. We had nearly 600,000 taking place then. In 1976, 600,000 children being abused. What do we have today? I don't know if it will be surprising to anybody. Over 3 million children are being abused or neglected in America today. That is the state of our culture. 
What about violent crimes? I chair the District of Columbia Subcommittee. We have no shortage of violent crimes here. We have had three police officers murdered, assassinated, actually. I have had three staff members who have suffered break-ins in my short service in the U.S. Senate. I have been here 4 months. This is a violent society. Look at the numbers per 100,000. About 160 per 100,000 in 1960; 746 per 100,000 in 1993. My goodness, a shocking amount of violent crime taking place in this society. 
What have we had taking place in abortion during this period in our society and our culture? In 1973 we had a little under 800,000 abortions in America occurring, in this country an awful lot. Look, it has nearly doubled, 1.6 million per year in America. 
If you are an astute observer you will notice some inconsistencies here between a couple of these charts. You will say, `Wait a minute, shouldn't child abuse have gone down if we had children who were not wanted who did not come into the world?' We were promised that an expansion of legal abortion would make every child a wanted child and reduce abuse and neglect, yet child abuse has gone up during that same period of time that we have nearly 1.6 million abortions in America annually. 
What has happened here? What is going on? I think it just talks about--it is a debate everybody is familiar with, the coarsening of our culture, the lack of love, the lack of respect. You can call it, really, whatever you want to. It is just that this culture has been in decline for the past 30 years. We get child neglect on the rise, and violent crimes, and 1.6 million abortions a year in America. But do you know what the hopeful note is here? It is we are finally talking about how we limit some of this. 
We all, everybody in this body, want this number to go down. Everybody in this body, regardless of whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, wants this number to go down. Now we are finally talking about it. How can we help bring this number down? 
I oppose Senator Daschle's amendment. I don't think his does it. I don't think we will have any fewer of these taking place. I don't know how many we are actually talking about with the bill of the Senator from Pennsylvania, and nobody really knows, but I think what we are really talking about is we, as a nation, don't really like this. We want it to be less. We want to stop it. We want it to go down. 
Mother Teresa was here in this country 3 years ago. She is a saint to all of us. She is probably today the most respected person in the world. She addressed the National Prayer Breakfast 3 years ago, and she stood there, this small, frail little woman, and said, `Can't you care for your children? If you can't, send me your children and I will care for them. Send me your children. I'll care for your children.' She also noted at that point in time, as she noted previously, America is not a rich nation; America is a poor nation--it is poor in love and caring. 
I hope historians will look back on this debate and say this was the start of us changing this culture from destruction to caring, from saying how can we go down to how can we start back up, and that is the hopeful note I have here. That is why I support Senator Santorum's proposed bill to eliminate, to ban this procedure of partial-birth abortion.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I rise to speak about something of great sadness in our Nation. Tomorrow we will take a vote on partial-birth abortion. I want to speak about that particular issue if I could this evening from a particular perspective that I think might be somewhat different from folks who might look at this as a sterile procedure, a procedure that we may consider banning. I would like to talk about what it says of our culture, what this procedure that is being used today says about us. Is the loss of love in our culture actually so great that we could actually kill a child and explain it away? I think this is actually how we ought to look at this debate on this issue. 
I oppose the partial-birth abortion procedure being conducted in United States other than in cases of loss of life of the mother, and then I think we need to clearly say that this is available in cases of loss of life of the mother. My wife and I have three children, and I would hate to think that she would be put in a spot where she could not have access to a medical procedure that she desperately needed for her own life. But that is taken care of in this bill and there is an allowance for it. In the case where the life of the mother is at risk, this procedure is allowed, and that is proper and as it should be. We allow that to take place. 
What I want to talk about more is that we have so many of these abortions happening in this country. What does it say about the culture and our own loss of care and our own loss of love? What does it say about us that this procedure is even allowed. 
I want to point out to this body some of the things that have happened to American culture over the past 30 years that I think point out we have lost the care for other individuals and we have lost the compassion for others and even for babies. 
Let us look at this chart, if I could share it with you. We are looking at child abuse and neglect reports in America, and this is 1976 to 1995. We are looking at numbers of reports in the millions. We are looking at about 600,000 in 1976, which is wholly too much, we are looking at 3 million, over 3 million in 1995. 
The growth that has taken place during that period of time, what does that say about a loss of care and a loss of compassion in our society and in our culture? 
I want to look at this next chart, violent crime offenses in our society. Look where we were in 1960. This is rate per 100,000 individuals. For every 100,000 individuals in America, we had about 160 violent crime offenses in 1960. 
Where are we today? In 1993, the latest we have numbers for, we are at 746 per 100,000 people. From 160 to 746 during that period of time of roughly about 30, 33 years. 
I only point these out to ask, what is it today about our culture? I think our culture is in a great depression, that we are violent, we are not caring for our children, we are not doing the right things for them, and we are not doing the right things to try to correct it. We have to rebuild the culture, and I think we rebuild it by loving and caring for each other, and we will. 
To me, that is what this debate is about. It is about banning a particular procedure used on babies, and it is about saying we should not, in a civilized society, allow this. We should not, in looking at this sort of violence and lack of caring and lack of respect in this society, let something like this go on. It is about those who are involved and it is about 
our conscience being pricked by this. 
We see these charts--Senator Santorum has pointed to them --about the child being born, and we get uncomfortable; we don't like that because it is striking our conscience and it is saying it is not civilized for us to be doing and continuing this procedure. We see it and we do not like it. If we saw it happening to an animal, we would not like it, and we certainly feel that way towards a child. 
That is why I urge my colleagues and the American people, let us reject this procedure as part of rebuilding our culture, as part of restaking this ground. We need to have is compassion and care and love for the most defenseless in our culture. 
This is a child we are talking about. We must start turning these trends around and start caring for the most defenseless in this situation. 
I think it is clear that we are going to pass this bill in the Senate. I hope we will pass it by an overwhelming majority and that we build on this from this point forward, saying let us change this culture. Let us bring it back to caring. Let us bring it back to compassion and love for everybody, especially the most defenseless. 
With that, I yield back my time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for bringing this important amendment forward. I state at the outset that I support disaster relief. I think it is important to help those places in our country that are experiencing great difficulty because of a natural disaster that is occurring. We ought to step in. It is important that we do it. But I also think we ought to stop creating and continuing the manmade disaster that we have done here, the $5.4 trillion in debt that is stealing from our children, that is driving interest rates up, that is taking jobs, that is hurting our Nation. 
It seems that in and of itself is almost a definition of a disaster, and we create it. I think this is an important debate because the point here is not whether we support disaster relief, because we do. We support disaster relief. The question is, do we pay for it and should we be doing that in this overall debate? I do not think we have really looked at this before, even though we have been talking about balancing the budget, now, for a number of years. It seems now we are finally on a track to discuss really balancing the budget. For a lot of years it was just kind of: That is good politics to talk about balancing the budget, but we really cannot do it. Now we are going to do it. Now we are really going to balance the budget. We are actually going to balance the budget by the year 2002, if not before. With this strong economy we could do it by the year 2000. 
This is for real now. It seems to me, then, as we enter into these debates now about emergency supplementals, helping people out, that we do things for real. One thing that is real to families is that, if you have a disaster personally, you are going to have to figure out some way to pay for it. The same should be true for us. If we have a disaster, we need to figure out how we can pay for it. 
This is a minimal act. I hope people have focused on what we are talking about. We are talking about 1.9 percent offset against discretionary spending the rest of this year, and then just requiring that the money go against the caps in future years. That is all we are talking about. That is it. It is not talking about cutting disaster relief. It is not talking about: We are going to steal this money out of here and take it out of there; 1.9 percent, 2 percent, and then in the future it is just about being under the budget caps. 
As we move forward to balance the budget for real we need to move forward and take care of our emergencies for real. This is for real. This makes it real. This allows us to actually do what is real in balancing the budget, so we do not keep driving up this manmade disaster of the $5.4 trillion in debt that we have. 
I think this is an important debate and I hope Members really search through and think about it. If they really do support balancing the budget, they would really do what is for real here and vote for this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to give some remarks on an amendment being offered today by myself and by Senator Roberts as well as my colleagues from New Mexico, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman. 
This amendment, which is revenue neutral, is critically important to education in the State of Kansas. 
It should be noted that this amendment does not cost the Federal Government any money. In fact, it simply allows the Department of Education in Kansas to grant deductibility in the school finance formula for impact aid funding. Without this amendment it is likely that the Kansas taxpayers would have to pay an extra $6 million in taxes to fully fund the State's education programs. 
This amendment corrects for a potentially very expensive technicality. I therefore urge the timely consideration of this very important and time sensitive amendment.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain, amendment numbered 107, and state that I am not here to oppose any of the emergency relief being put forward. 
I think that is important and I think it is appropriate. 
I also think we ought to pay for it as we go along. We are going to every year somewhere in this country have a disaster. Each year we do this and then we have a disaster and we do not pay for it and it adds to the deficit and we create this mortgage disaster for the country on a long-term basis. We really ought to pay for it. That is another separate debate. 
I am here to support this issue and this amendment in removing those items that are not emergency appropriations. I do not want to speak about the validity or the need to do any of these specific projects that are in here. I think that can rest for another day. But the question is, are these emergencies or not? Are they things that should appear in an emergency appropriations bill?

Mr. BROWNBACK. These projects may be worthwhile. They may be things that we should finance, even though we are over $5.4 trillion in debt. Maybe they are things we need to do, but they are not emergencies. This is an emergency supplemental. We should remove the name `emergency' from it if that is the case, and we are just going through on a regular supplemental proceedings bill. 
I know a lot of people worked very hard in putting these together. At the end of the day, I think as you go down Senator McCain's list and ask, is the $250,000 to replace salmon fry killed during an April snowstorm in New England, is that truly an emergency? Are some of the things he listed, spoke about, truly emergencies? I think one would have to conclude under any reasonable review of those that they are not emergencies. They may be things we ought to do, but they are not things we should do here. They are not things we should do in this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the McCain amendment, to not table this issue, and pull these out and deal with these in the regular process in which they should dealt with. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks in morning business. Today, as most people recognize, is a national day for prayer. We have also been talking about a very important thing regarding families and a bill that has been put forward to try to help families be able to do their job better. 
What I would like to speak about a little bit today is building off of that statement and also off the National Day of Prayer to talk about, overall, the culture of America and what has happened to our Nation, what has happened in our culture. I think it probably would come as no surprise, unfortunately, to most people that our culture is in difficulty and has been having a great deal of problems lately. 
I have been looking at and studying this issue for some period of time. Plus, as I travel across my State, as I travel across Kansas, I hear more and more people mentioning how much difficulty they think the culture is in, how much they feel like they are fighting culture just to raise their kids and raise their families. I would like to take the Senate's time for just a few minutes to describe where are we today in this culture. Why do we need things like flexibility for families to be able to be families again? Why do we need to do those things? 
Let us look at some of these charts. I apologize ahead of time for how discouraging they are, because they are. As you look at these things--look at this. This is child abuse and neglect reports in America. We are talking, in 1976, about 500,000 of them, which was a lot at that point in time. But consider where we are today: 3 million in 1995 reported, of child abuse and neglect cases reported on an annual basis, 3 million. That is a high percentage of our children being recorded in this. This is a terrible situation and, unfortunately, an indictment of the culture. 
Let us look at out-of-wedlock births. This is something that has received a lot of attention overall in our society. Consider where we were in 1960--about 5 percent. And you can go back earlier in time and it stays at about this 3 to 5 percent level. Consider where we are today--30 percent. About one in every three children born in America today is born to a single mom. That is a tough situation. In our inner cities--in the District of Columbia we have here, that figure gets up to nearly 60 to 70 percent. 
My wife and I have three children. It is tough enough for two of us to raise them, let alone without flexible time to be able to get off from work, and let alone without being born into a situation where you start out with one parent just at the very outset. 
The next chart, violent crimes taking place in our society. Unfortunately, I think everybody knows the situation here, but look at the staggering numbers--staggering numbers. In 1960, we are talking about violent crime offenses--rape per 100,000, we had about between 100 to 200 per 100,000 citizens in the country in 1960. Look at where we are today. We are up at nearly 800 per 100,000 people. Look at that period of time, 1960 to 1993, 33 years, and we go up nearly sevenfold in violent crimes, sevenfold. 
My own staff here in Washington, DC, and I have only been here now 4 months, three of them have been burglarized, my own staff here in Washington, DC. This is across the country what is taking place. This is just a horrendous number, if you look at that. 
Take a look at this. This one is sad, about the hopelessness of some of our kids in this society. Just think about the concept even of a teenager, somebody who is just looking at getting into life and into what should be the flowering, the spring of his or her life, committing suicide; having, actually, the mental thought that I should end this life. To me that is just--it is almost unthinkable, anyway; abhorrent. What has happened in our culture? These are again per 100,000. We used to have about 3 in 1960. We are up to nearly 12; quadrupled in a 35-year time period, of teens 
being hopeless. How much more do they reflect the rest of teenagers who have thought about this and decide, well, I am not willing to quite take that step? It has quadrupled in 35 years, in the state of our society. 
What about marriages ending in divorce? Do not hear me to say I am perfect or my family is perfect. We have had divorces in our family, too, just like every family in America. But look at the numbers, because they are staggering; they really are. In 1920, about 10 or 11 percent of marriages ended in divorce. Where are we today? Nearly 50 percent; nearly 50 percent. And it affects all families everywhere. It affects my family, too. Look at that. 
What does it lead to overall? This is a chart of a Fordham University study on the culture. They have tracked the culture in America since 1970, and they use a whole set of different factors, some of which I would not consider; in others, I would add additional factors. But they overall said the culture, in their objective assessment, has declined from, in 1970, a 73 percent objective number to a 38 percent objective number--in half, the cultural decline in America, in a period--look at the time period we are talking about here--25 years. Is this incredible? 
I think on our National Day of Prayer we ought to be praying about the culture. And we ought to be thinking about what we can do ourselves and what we can do corporately in this society. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I appreciate that. 
Mr. President, I join with other Senators noting how extremely difficult and important this decision is to vote for treaty ratification. I have taken it very seriously, as well as everybody else. I have read the entire treaty. I sat down and thought it through. I have talked with people. I have talked with President Bush, Bob Dole, Colin Powell, Casper Weinberger, James Schlesinger, Richard Perle, and my 9-year-old son, too, who I think has a stake in this as well. 
I find it a terribly tough call to make on this treaty; a tough one to be able to decide what is in the best interest and ultimately what will get the fewest chemical weapons used in this world. That to me is the real litmus test issue. What is going to make the world safer is when we are going to have fewer chemical weapons used in the world. 
I would like to bare to the body that I chair the Middle East Subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee. We held a hearing just last week on U.S. policy toward Iran. Our policy has failed to stop them from receiving weapons of mass destruction, particularly chemical weapons. The Iranians are receiving precursor chemical weapons from the Chinese. 
May I have an additional minute and a half?

Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the chairman very much. 
As I mentioned in our hearing last week, it was noted and pointed out that the Iranians have received chemical weapons, precursor chemical weapons, from the Chinese and from other sources. 
I have reluctantly but clearly concluded that Iran would be more likely to obtain and use chemical weapons if we enter into this Chemical Weapons Convention with article X in place, which is currently how it sits; that they will be more likely to get and use chemical weapons, weapons of mass destruction. Iran is our erstwhile terrorist enemy. 
I spoke to Colin Powell. He noted that chemical weapons today are the weapons of choice, primarily, for terrorists. These are primarily weapons used by terrorists. That certainly fits the Iranians. 
So that is why I have, unfortunately, reluctantly yet clearly, decided that with article X in it and with the likelihood of that being used by the Iranians, that this treaty would actually cause more chemical weapons to be used by people that we don't want; by terrorist regimes such as the Iranians. Therefore, I will have to vote against this treaty.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for yielding to me for a few minutes to discuss this critical issue in front of the U.S. Senate, the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I would like to state at the very outset of my statement that I would like to be on record that as to the earlier vote we had today of supporting the CWC treaty that came to the floor earlier, that we had an oral vote on, that I support that treaty. I support it. And I will go into the reasons why I supported that and why I will have problems ultimately voting for it if we do not hold tightly to what hit the floor earlier. 
Mr. President, I just want to talk about this as a couple people would perhaps talk about it if they were sitting somewhere across this country, somewhere in my State of Kansas, and how they look at the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I think they would sit down and ask themselves: If we enter into this Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty, will it be less likely for chemical weapons to be used in the world or will it be more likely for chemical weapons to be used in the world? It seems to me that that is the real crucible that we have to decide this under: Is it more likely or less likely if we enter into this treaty? 
I take this treaty obligation very seriously. I chair the Middle East Subcommittee for Foreign Affairs, the region of the world where perhaps you have the most concentration and the most potentially recent use of chemical weapons happening in a battle situation. This is a very important issue in that region of the world. It is a very important issue in the United States as far as, are we going to be able to rid the world of these terrible, horrible weapons of mass destruction? I take that very seriously. So I have sat and I have visited with a number of people, experts on both sides. 
On Monday I did maybe an unusual thing for a Senator. I read the treaty. The parts of it I had not read, I have now read the treaty. I need to get on through the attachments, but I have gone through this. I have looked at the arguments. I have looked particularly at the problems. I have looked at the overall good aspects of it, and I want to say that I do strongly support the objectives of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We must oppose the use and existence of chemical weapons. There is just no doubt about it. They are an abomination that needs to be removed from the face of the Earth. We all agree on that. 
But it is actually for that reason, however, that I have some great difficulties with one particular provision--a number of them within the treaty actually, but one in 
particular. That is article X of this treaty. It is for that reason, if that is left in this treaty, I do not think that I can support the overall vote, if article X is left in. 
Let me say why. The Chemical Weapons Convention, if that is left in, I believe will have the exact opposite of the intended effect. And that is, as I said at the outset, are we going to have more chemical weapons used or less? If article X is left in, I fear greatly we are going to have more use of chemical weapons taking place even though the purpose is exactly the opposite. 
Let me say why. Article X requires nations to share defensive technology regarding chemical weapons. It is something that has been discussed at some length. The particular paragraph reads this way:  
Each State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and scientific and technological information concerning means of protection against chemical weapons. 
In other words, we are going to be sharing technology, particularly defensive technology, which is very high technology in many of these areas. I fear that that technology is going to more easily get into the hands of rogue nations, like Iran. I am very concerned about their getting weapons of mass destruction. 
We had a hearing last week in the Middle East Subcommittee regarding the threat and the expansion of Iran's capacity for mass destruction. The Chinese--and this is unclassified information--have sold precursor chemical weapons to the Iranians. This has in fact occurred. They do not use that without defensive technology to support their own troops, yet this treaty will make the possibility of their getting that defensive technology more likely, if not even ordered within the treaty. 
You can say, wait a minute. That is just your interpretation. Well, let us look at what Secretary Cheney has said on this, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, an admirable man, who served in the House of Representatives, also in the administration under President Bush. He says this about this treaty: 
[the] obligation to share with potential adversaries like Iran, chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for military purposes and chemical defensive equipment, threaten to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all. 
Then he is joined, of course, as you know, by former Defense Secretaries Schlesinger, Weinberger, Rumsfeld, and others. 
Now you say, well, this is not going to happen. That is just not going to occur. We are not going to have people selling them this sort of technology, either us or other nations. 
And maybe we will not do it. But will other nations then step forward and sell this defensive technology? You say no, that will not happen. There have been people already pointing out the fact that actually that has already occurred under some previous treaties--the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty being one where the Russians now cite to us that treaty as a reason for them to sell nuclear production capacity to the Iranians, citing the very treaty we entered into to stop this from taking place and that is used back against this to try to expand. And now the Iranians having this capacity, we are trying to stop this nuclear generator from getting fully online for the Iranians. And the Russians cite a nonproliferation treaty that they have to share this technology with the Iranians. 
That certainly is not the intent. I am very fearful we will repeat the same mistakes of history here. We have to stop the abomination of chemical weapons. We have to stop it in the United States. We have to stop it in the world. We have to stop the abomination of these weapons of mass destruction, these terrible weapons of mass destruction being used. The way to do that is to have a CWC treaty that actually does it and doesn't spread their use. And striking article X is the way to do that. With that, even though the treaty has a number of other problems, it is supportable. Without that, I actually fear the opposite will occur. 
And with that I would like to yield back the time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the opportunity to be able to address the American people on a very difficult day. I would like to recognize a couple of things that have been said by previous speakers, to start off with. 
I congratulate the President on the reduction of the overall deficit that has taken place during the past 4 years, because the deficit has gone down. But what I also want to point out to the American people is there are a couple of ways of doing this. In the first 2 years of President Clinton's time in office, with a Democratic Congress, they did it by raising taxes. In the second 2 years, with a Republican Congress, we lowered the deficit by cutting spending. Now, you can go either way on this; you can raise taxes or cut spending. I happen to believe that, in the long term, when you raise taxes, you are going to cut your revenues and it is going to make things worse. The point of it is, on tax day, we should be talking about the level of taxes; they are too high in this country. The way to reduce the deficit is by cutting spending. That is not the way it was done in the first 2 years--by raising taxes. 
The second thing I would like to respond to that has been raised by the other side of the aisle is capital gains taxes. That certainly needs to be cut, along with some others, and along with a $500 per child tax credit for working and struggling families. 
I find it interesting that, as we look forward to working with the issue of Washington, DC, the District of Columbia, and rejuvenating the District of Columbia, a metro area that has great difficulties in this country, one that we have had a lot of problems with which are well known to this Nation--do you know what the other side of the aisle is proposing to rejuvenate Washington, DC? What Eleanor Holmes Norton, along with Jack Kemp, is supporting to rejuvenate Washington, DC? They are proposing a zero capital gains tax rate on real property. Both the left and the progrowth ring on the right in this Congress are proposing zero capital gains for Washington, DC. Why would they do that? If this is such a bad thing to do, why are we doing it to Washington, DC? Because they know it will stimulate growth, hope, and opportunity. That is being put forth by Eleanor Holmes Norton and Jack Kemp. 
These are things that I think people have to realize. When you make those sorts of cuts, it stimulates the growth overall taking place in the economy. Now, the month of April--particularly April 15--I think serves as a powerful reminder of the size and scope of the Federal Government. Even though America will pay its taxes today, Americans will not be freed from taxation. They will not experience tax freedom day until May 9. Last year, it was May 7. This year, it goes up 2 more days, and it won't be until May 9. In other words, on May 9, ladies and gentlemen, you finally start working for yourself instead of the Government. Up until May 9, you are effectively working for the Government, paying your taxes to carry this huge, large Federal Government that is too big. 
The issue is not that we should raise taxes to balance the budget; the issue is, we should cut taxes and cut the size, the scope, and the intrusiveness of the Federal Government to liberate the American people. 
Today, a family of four must send both parents into the workplace to provide for the same standard of living that was once provided by only one parent. Is that a way to support the family across America, that we have to have both parents going out and working just to support the family? Is that a way to have strong families across the country? I don't think it is. 
Unfortunately, even with both parents working, our families are still often unable to get ahead. Living paycheck to paycheck has been the norm for American families for as long as our Federal Government has grown as large as it as, consuming more and more. 
Taxes hurt America's families. They punish good investment, they stifle entrepreneurial activity, and they hamper true economic growth. That is why I support a tax limitation amendment and insist that any budget deal must provide for meaningful tax relief. 
Balancing the budget and cutting taxes are not mutually exclusive goals, as some would have you believe. In fact, balancing America's budget virtually requires that we cut taxes. In the long run, it will be more difficult to balance the budget if we do not shrink the size of our Federal Government with significant tax cuts. And what we are doing today is happening across this country. We have a good economy that is growing strong. We are having an economy that is producing more revenues coming into the Federal Government. We need that to continue to take place if we are going to be able to balance the budget. You need to have growth taking place in the economy. That is the critical nature of cutting taxes. It continues to stimulate growth so we can have those revenues coming in and balance the budget, and it is not enough to just balance the budget. 
As my good colleague from South Carolina has pointed out, we need to start paying the debt down so that interest levels can go down. 
The tax limitation amendment is a simple amendment requiring a supermajority in both Houses in order to raise taxes; in other words, more than a majority. You have to have a supermajority. And we should do that so that we don't just shift this Government from being debt financed to being tax financed. We need to be able to, overall, force the Government to be smaller and to live within its means instead of taking more of those means from hard-working American families. 
Later today the House will vote on the tax limitation amendment. I believe this vote will send a strong message to the American people that the Republicans in the House are committed to truly reducing the tax burden in America. The Senate had an opportunity to unify with the House and show their support for this amendment but balked at the opportunity late last week. I think that is an unfortunate reality that too many people lack the wherewithal to stand up to the tax-and-spending regimes of this Government and say no--just say no--to future tax increases. 
Because Congress has lacked the will in the past on both sides of the aisle to stand up to a flawed Keynesian economic principle that our Government has used in its fiscal policy, that has hurt economic growth and that has hurt our families. 
I think what we have to do clearly in the future is we just have to stand up and say no to more big Government programs, to put policies in place that reduce that tax burden, that release the American people, their opportunities, their entrepreneurial spirit, and their families to grow and to prosper. Government must be cut. Taxes must be cut. 
Mr. President, I want to quote the President of the United States who, a couple of years ago, made a very clear statement to the American people. It was resonating very clearly, which the American people wanted to believe. But they know it is just not true yet. And it may end up being the signature statement of this President. `The era of big Government is over.' Well, the era of big Government unfortunately is only over in rhetoric. In practice, it remains, and more is even being proposed by the President. 
To end the era of big Government, we must end the era of big taxes and a big Tax Code. I want to point out to you, Mr. President, and others about the size of the Tax Code. This is something that Steve Forbes has made us familiar with. But I think it is pretty good on a graphic. 
Just look at the words that govern our lives and the important documents that have taken place. You can see that they do not necessarily have to be documents with a lot of words to have a great deal of meaning. The Declaration of Independence--1,300 words--which declared our independence and more vision of a National Government. 
The Holy Bible--773,000 words are in this document that so many people read and go to with reverence.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. I thank my good colleague from Georgia for yielding time to me. I would also like to thank and recognize and compliment Senator Coverdell, Senator Feinstein, and others who have worked tirelessly on this effort to try to get more help in stopping all the drug trafficking through Mexico. I know they have worked very hard to try to craft a vehicle and language to be able to get at this issue, which we all want to do, which is reduce the drug trafficking, reduce the amount of drug flow from and through Mexico to the United States. I applaud their efforts and their tireless work in getting this done. 
However, in looking at the language of this bill, I must rise in opposition to certifying Mexico as complying with our drug-trafficking efforts, and this is not, in my estimation, as I consider this vote and weigh it carefully, about bashing Mexico. This is not about bashing the administration. This is about complying with the law and interpretation of that law and a judgment that each of us must make. The fact is section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act requires that the President certify that Mexico has cooperated fully with the United States or taken adequate steps on its own to fight drug trafficking. 
That is the law, and that is the interpretation and that is what each of us have to interpret, whether this is done: Has Mexico cooperated fully with the United States or taken adequate steps on its own? Sadly, I come to the conclusion the facts are that Mexico has not cooperated fully with the United States and the steps they have taken to combat the drug trade are far from adequate. I am sad in taking that position and in looking at it this way, but I can arrive at no other conclusion. 
There was a slight increase in 1996 in both drug seizures and arrests of drug traffickers. But sadly, again, this is because the numbers for 1995 were so low. Their record over the 1992 to 1993 period shows that they can do much better; they were much, much higher. So the Mexican Government, working more in cooperation with us, can do much better. In fact, Mexico's current record clearly indicates that they should not be certified for antidrug cooperation. U.S. drug agents report that the situation on the border has never been worse. 
I applaud Senator Coverdell and Senator Feinstein for laying out in detail the facts that are before us. I would like to reiterate some of them again if I could. 
Mexico continues to be a major transit point for cocaine entering the United States from South America. Fifty to 70 percent of the cocaine entering the United States transits Mexico, and Mexico is a supplier of 20 to 30 percent of the heroin to the United States market and up to 80 percent of the foreign-grown marijuana. Seizures of cocaine were about the same as the last 2 years but about half the level of seizures in 1991 to 1993. Drug arrests were up for 1995. However, they were considerably less than arrests in 1992 to 1993. Mexico refuses to allow the United States Navy ships patrolling for drug smugglers to put into Mexican ports to refuel without 30 days' notice. Mexico has enacted money laundering legislation, but so far the legislation has not been implemented, and Mexico is 12 months late in producing necessary banking regulations. 
The record on this issue is clear, and sadly so. It is not credible to claim that Mexico has fully cooperated with the United States in fighting drug trafficking. On the contrary, the major Mexico-based drug cartels have risen to being some of the most powerful trafficking groups in the world. 
I think we absolutely have to send a strong signal to the administration and to our neighbors to the south that the certification process is not just a rubberstamp exercise and that we require action on this issue. I say again that I arrive at this conclusion sadly because I think everybody in this body would much rather be able to easily certify, and I do applaud the efforts of Senator Coverdell, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hutchison, and many others in working on this. But we are just not there and I cannot support the certification. 
I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BROWNBACK. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fairness in State Trading Act of 1997. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senators Grassley, Hagel, and Johnson, is a bipartisan approach to addressing the problem faced by U.S. exporters in countries in which state trading enterprises [STE's] dominate the economy. 
The Fairness in State Trading Act would subject the import activities of STE's to the jurisdiction of section 1106 of the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, (19 U.S.C. 2905). If this bill passes, the President would have to determine whether the import activities of the state trading enterprises of an applicant to the WTO impede, or are likely to impede, U.S. exports to that country. If the President makes such a determination, the WTO Agreement cannot apply between the United States and that nation until the latter agrees that its STE's will make decisions based exclusively on commercial considerations. 
The Brownback bill is designed to ensure that the WTO accession protocol agreements of such countries as China, Russia, and the Ukraine include a provision in which these countries specifically agree that their STE's will make purchasing decisions based solely on commercial considerations. This provision is important because these WTO applicants have indicated that they intend to continue to purchase commodities such as wheat, corn, rice, vegetable oils, and sugar exclusively or almost exclusively through STE's. 
Without a strong commitment from these countries to depoliticize their import practices, the United States would only have recourse to GATT article XVII for questionable activities undertaken by China's STE's. In 1995, the GAO determined that article XVII is an ineffective mechanism for policing the activities of STE's, and that the state trading activities of China, Russia, and the Ukraine present problems that article XVII is not capable of addressing. 
Weak enforcement of STE activities would enable the STE's of new WTO members to continue to employ a politicized procurement process. Why should the United States be more concerned about the state trading activities of new members of the WTO rather than the activities of current members? Because the state trading activities of current WTO members pale in comparison to the state trading activities of nations such as China, Russia, and the Ukraine. 
Import decisions must be made on purely commercial considerations. GATT article XVII is not capable of effectively policing the state trading activities of countries accustomed to a command-and-control economic model. Before we apply the WTO Agreement between the United States and these countries, we must ensure that they agree to depoliticize their import practices. 
Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and States across the Nation grow the best crops in the world. Exports of these and other U.S. commodities have skyrocketed as tariff and nontariff barriers to these goods have been reduced worldwide. We cannot allow state trading activities to supplant tariff and other nontariff measures as the new barriers to U.S. exports. Let's make sure that U.S. goods can compete on a level playing field in the markets of new members of the WTO before we lock in reductions in our barriers to goods from these countries. Please print statement and bill in the Record.

I also thank the Senator from West Virginia for educating and sharing with us some of the culture and the history of the U.S. Senate, which I think is always beneficial for us to have and to be able to share with the American people the history, the ability, and the nature of this body as it was set up by the Founding Fathers and which has been maintained with most of its integrity since that time and age of what they set forward. 
I think it is always positive for us to know the history and the nature and why we serve and how we should serve.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to address the body today on legislation that I am introducing, along with Senator Lieberman, Senator DeWine, and Senator Kohl, an act called the Television Improvement Act of 1997. It is my sincere hope that this bill will help solve one of our nation's most troubling problems. 
I am fresh off the campaign trail, as the Senator from Georgia is fresh off the campaign trail. Throughout the 1996 campaign, I traveled across the State of Kansas and talked with thousands of people. I came away from that experience convinced that the most important task that we as a Nation face today is renewing the American culture. 
I can recall countless meetings where individuals, particularly parents, would come up to me worried about the future of the American culture, particularly as it affects their children, and they constantly felt they were having to fight the culture to raise their kids. They hearken back to a time when they didn't feel like they were so opposed by the nature of the American culture. They recall a time when the culture was supportive of what they were doing and helped them in raising a good and solid family. They were just pleading for help. `Help us be able to come to a point where we can effectively raise our children. Don't make us have to constantly fight our culture.' 
Hollywood is the center of gravity for the American culture and, increasingly, the world's culture. Hollywood has changed the culture in this country, and, unfortunately, it has led to a decline in our culture. Over the past 15 years, television has made our children think that violence is OK, that sexuality out of wedlock is expected and encouraged, and that criminal activity is OK. Well, these things are not OK, and it's time the industry changed television to make it easier for parents to raise children. 
The Television Improvement Act of 1997 is intended to encourage the broadcasting industry to make raising children easier. What it intends to do is to allow the broadcast industry--the television, cable, and motion picture industries to enter into, again, a code of conduct comparable to the one they used until 1983. They would once again be able to say that there is a standard below which they will not go, and they can collaborate to establish that standard without running afoul of Federal antitrust laws. 
Previously, the NAB had a self-imposed code of conduct that governed television content. The code recognized the impact of television on our children as well as the responsibility that broadcasters shared in providing programming that used television's influence carefully. However, in 1983, a Federal district court determined that some of the advertising provisions of the code violated Federal antitrust laws. 
Although the court did not rule that any of the code's programming standards violated antitrust laws, the NAB decided to stop using the entire code. The past 15 years have demonstrated that the code of conduct is sorely missed. Television has declined over the past 15 years, in no small part due to the absence of the code. I don't think anybody in this body could argue--or in this country who would disagree--that the nature of American television has declined over the past 15 years. 
Let me read for the body a statement that is from the old code of conduct that the National Association of Broadcasters used until 1983. It sounds almost quaint today. But listen to the content of what the industry itself had before. It says: 
Above and beyond the requirements of the law, broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in which many of their programs are viewed. There shall be no graphic portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. The portrayal of implied sexual acts must be essential to the plot and presented in a responsible and tasteful manner. 
I do not think there would be many people today who would say that this reflects the nature of television today. But I think many Americans today would say, `That is what I want television to be today so I don't have to always fight the TV to raise my kids.' 
It is not enough for everybody to say, `Just turn it off.' My wife and I are raising three children. It is a little tougher than just saying, `Turn it off.' It is about being there all the time. We are trying. One of us is there all the time. It is also not enough to say, `Well, we have a rating code so you know what is on television.' 
We are pleading with the industry, saying, `Let's go back to that time when you used a code because television was better then and it so directly impacts the culture and the soul of America.' The average American spends 5 hours a day watching TV. Most would liken it to a stovepipe of black soot going into the mind and into the soul. Why don't we change that back to the way it used to be, and have it as a well of fresh spring water going into the mind and into the soul? 
The industry is fully capable of doing this. Witness some of the current shows, especially `Touched by an Angel,' which is a leading show by CBS today. It is a good, positive, and uplifting show. But, sadly, there are far more that are far more degrading that would lead one more to the stovepipe analogy rather than the fresh spring well water. 
We are pleading with the industry with this bill. This bill provides no additional authority to the Federal Government; not an ounce of additional authority to the FCC. It is a plea to the industry to help us. We are having trouble. The American family has been under attack. In many places it has disintegrated. In our inner cities we have 70 percent of our children born to single moms. In many places we no longer have families, one of the basic tenets of culture. 
We are asking by this very simple act and pleading with the industry. `Let's go back to the time when television did not hurt our lives.' And we are not suggesting censorship. If we have a better product coming out of this industry, we will have a better American culture. We will have a better world culture because Hollywood is the center of gravity for not only this culture but increasingly the world's culture. It is coming up time and time again. 
So we are introducing this bill today, a bipartisan bill, requesting that the industry negotiate and work together on a code of conduct the like of which it had before. 
We will be holding hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee. We have been joined by the chairman and the ranking member of the appropriate Judiciary subcommittee who are cosponsoring this bill. We anticipate that they will have hearings on it as well. It is a follow-on to Senator Simon's work in this area in 1990. We hope that it will be much more successful. If it is not, there will be further action coming to try to address this corrosive effect that, unfortunately, television has on our society and, indeed, on the world. 
So, Mr. President, we are introducing this bill today asking the industry for help to lead our culture back to a brighter and a better time. They can do it. They are capable of doing it. 
Mr. President, again, let me say that I am pleased to introduce today with Senators Lieberman, DeWine, and Kohl, the Television Improvement Act of 1997, a bill that I believe will help solve one of our Nation's most troubling problems. Throughout the 1996 campaign, I traveled across the State of Kansas and talked with thousands of people. I came away from that experience with the conclusion that the most important task that we as a nation face today is renewing the American culture. 
People are desperately worried about the decline of our culture and about the decline of the American family. Many of the parents that I spoke with during the summer and fall believe that they increasingly have to fight their culture to raise their children. These parents feel that American culture in the 1990's actually makes it more difficult to raise children. 
Hollywood is the center of gravity for the American culture and increasingly the world's culture. Hollywood has changed the culture in this country, and, unfortunately, it has led to a decline in our culture. Over the past 15 years, television has made our children think that violence is OK, that sexuality out of wedlock is expected and encouraged, and that criminal activity is OK. Well, these things are not OK, and it's time the industry changed television to make it easier for parents to raise children. 
Previously, the National Association of Broadcasters had a self-imposed code of conduct that governed television content. The code recognized the impact of television on our children as well as the responsibility that broadcasters shared in providing programming that used television's influence carefully. However, in 1983, a Federal district court determined that some of the advertising provisions included in the code violated Federal antitrust laws. 
Although the court did not rule that any of the code's programming standards violated antitrust laws, the NAB decided to stop using the entire code. The past 15 years have demonstrated that the code of conduct is sorely missed. Television has declined over the past 15 years, in no small part due to the absence of the code. 
For this reason, Senators Lieberman, DeWine, Kohl, and I are introducing this bill to make perfectly clear that the broadcast industry is not violating Federal antitrust laws if its members collaborate on a code of conduct that includes voluntary guidelines intended to alleviate the negative impact that television content has had on our children and to promote educational and otherwise beneficial programming. 
In drafting this legislation, we have built upon Senator Simon's Television Program Improvement Act of 1990. Unlike that law, however, the Television Improvement Act of 1997 would not include a sunset provision, and we have expanded the scope of the antitrust exemption to enable the industry to tackle such issues as the proliferation of programming that contains sexual content and condones criminal behavior. 
Senator Lieberman and I plan to hold hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee's Government Management and Restructuring Subcommittee, which I chair and on which Senator Lieberman serves as the ranking Democrat. The hearings will explore the impact that the Federal Government has had on the ability of the television industry to broadcast more inspirational and less harmful programming. We will examine whether the application of Federal antitrust laws to a collaboration by the broadcasters to promote better programming hinders the industry's ability to police itself and has resulted in a decline in television broadcasting. The Federal Government should not be impeding any voluntary effort by the industry to improve the quality of programming; the Government should be encouraging such an effort. 
Let me just reiterate that we are not calling for a government mandate to be imposed upon the industry, nor are we providing the FCC with an ounce of additional authority with respect to broadcasting. What we are doing is trying to encourage the industry to do what it did prior to 1983--broadcast less programming that harms our kids and more programming that helps us raise our kids. We want Hollywood to start producing, and we want the broadcasters to start airing, better programming. 
I ask that the bill be appropriately referred.

 Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I introduce a piece of legislation that is being cosponsored by five of my colleagues. This legislation is the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997. 
But first of all I would like to recognize the tremendous work of Congressman J.D. Hayworth in pushing this legislation during the last Congress. As leader of the Constitutional Caucus J.D. has worked hard to return to Congress its constitutionally granted authority over the lawmaking process, and it is a privilege to be able to work with him on this legislation during the 105th. Congressman J.D. Hayworth will introduce the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997 along with 30 of his House colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives later today. 
I believe the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997 will provide a powerful tool in returning to Congress the constitutional responsibility it has abdicated for much of this century to unaccountable executive branch bureaucrats. 
Ultimately this bill is about returning the constitutional responsibility of Congress back to the Congress. 
Article I, section 1 of the Constitution states, `All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.' 
I believe that for too long Congress has ignored this provision by purposely writing excessively broad laws that are left not to Congress for interpretation but instead to unaccountable bureaucrats. As it stands now; Congress writes a law, an executive branch agency then interprets the law and promulgates regulations, and then the agency enforces the regulation. The agency in effect becomes both the maker and the enforcer of law. 
This is wrong. 
I agree with Madison, who wrote in the Federalist Papers that the consolidation of power into one branch of government is tyrannical. 
This type of consolidation separates the American people from the process of lawmaking by separating the Congress from the promulgation of rules and regulations. 
Taxation without representation was the charge levied at the British Government at the birth of our country. I believe a new charge levied at our own Government is regulation without representation. I believe it is a charge that we must answer. 
The American people have a right to be heard in the lawmaking process; and we have a constitutional responsibility to make the law. Congress cannot and must not continue to carelessly delegate its authority away to executive branch agencies. In fact, it must take back that which it has already given away. 
We must be responsible. 
My bill will make us responsible. The Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997 will force Congress to vote on the rules and regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies before the rules and regulations can take effect. 
Some will argue that this process will place an increased burden on the Congress who, they argue, already has little enough time to consider all the issues that come before it. This is an understandable concern. 
The obvious answer is that regardless of the time burden it is still our constitutional responsibility to oversee the lawmaking process. 
But our bill does address some of these concerns. For example, our bill will require Congress to vote on every proposed rule or regulation in an expedited manner, unless a majority of Members vote to send it through the normal legislative process. Under the expedited procedure the majority leader of both Houses, by request, must submit a bill comprised of the text of the regulation for consideration. The bill must then come before the respective Chamber for a vote within 60 days with debate limited to 1 hour and not amendable. If the bill is sent through the normal legislative process it is amendable. If the bill is not introduced the regulation is effectively killed. Congress must act for the regulation to take effect. 
It is our responsibility to represent our constituents, to create a better Government, and to ensure the integrity of our democracy by always striving to give those who don't have a voice, a voice. It is our duty--it is what we were sent here to do. 
Constitutional experts from across the country have expressed their strong support for this legislation. 
Judge Robert Bork and Stephen Breyer have both expressed support for this issue. As well Professor David Schoenbrod at New York Law School and Professor Marci Hamilton at Cardozo have written letters strongly recommending that we adopt this bill and reassert our constitutional responsibility over the creation of laws. KU law professors Henry Butler and Steve McCallister have signed on as well. Professor John Hart Eli of the University of Miami has endorsed this bill as well. 
This is a bipartisan concept that has, in the past, enjoyed the support of people like Senator Bill Bradley, and Nadine Strossen, president of the ACLU. Judge Robert Bork has expressed his support for this concept as well. 
It is my sincere hope that Congress will act as it ought to act and in so doing pass the Congressional Responsibility Act of 1997 and once and for all return to Congress the authority it should have never given away. 
I urge speedy consideration of this timely and vitally important piece of legislation.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the era of big Government is over. May it rest in peace. In its place a new era is about to unfold. An unlimited America with a smaller Federal Government, economic opportunity for all, and a renewed culture. 
An unlimited America was the vision for the Nation set forth by our Founding Fathers. It is the vision enshrined in those two great charters of freedom: our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution. Many of America's most intractable problems stem from the fact that we've strayed from that vision--and lost direction. But I have no doubt that if we can recapture the Founders's vision of limited Government, personal responsibility, and economic opportunity that America's greatest days will be yet to come. 
The Founding Fathers of our Nation believed in the people. They created a new nation based on the radical notion that the people could be free and trusted--that the nation would be great if you trusted the people to be good. Before the birth of America, individual rights only existed so far as the grace of the dictator or monarch allowed. They were believed to have a divine right to rule, because it was thought that the people could not be trusted to rule themselves. 
Our Founders believed that the people had the right to govern themselves--and that government derives its power from the consent of the governed. But this right also imposed a requirement on `We the People': We must be a moral and just people. John Adams put it this way, `Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.' 
Yet, today, we have placed the Government in the role that was reserved for citizenship. We have gone from `We the People' to They the Bureaucracy. 
In our recent efforts to create a more perfect union we have relied too much on the Government and too little on ourselves. We have forgotten that self-government demands the habits and virtues required for such a government. `Republican government,' James Madison noted, `presupposes the existence of these qualities in a higher degree than any other form.' Yet at some point we decided that goodness for the Nation simply came from the greatness of government. But the greatness of our Nation can never be measured by the size of our GDP or even the strength of our armies. National greatness rises from personal goodness. 
And that is the starting point for ending the era of big Government and beginning the era of an unlimited America. Our mission is to re-limit the Federal Government; to release economic opportunity for all our citizens; and to renew our families and our culture. In my view these principles are not divisible--if any one is missing, the old era will not give way to the new and America will not return to the straight path--the only path which leads to national greatness.

Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair. I appreciate that. 
I am honored to be able to address this body today once again on the importance of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
Balancing the budget is simply no longer an option. The future of our children literally hangs in the balance. Every day we spend debating this issue, we add billions of dollars to the deficit. We have to give ourselves the tools to be able to assure that we can stay in balance. 
This is an astounding fact, but in the February issue of Nation's Business they state that unless Government spending policies are altered, the average--the average--net tax burden on Americans born between 1960 and 1993 will soar from the current 34 percent to 85 percent of their lifetime incomes. That is 85 percent lifetime income going to taxes. It is thoroughly reprehensible to allow our children to be taxed at this rate simply because we do not have the courage to do what is right. 
How can we do this to our children? It is imperative that we pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution for the kids. 
I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a statement that was made yesterday by an individual heavily involved in the debate on partial-birth abortions. Like most Americans, I oppose partial-birth abortions. These latest facts which have now come to light show that the defense of this indefensible procedure has been built on some outright lies. 
Yesterday, Wednesday, February 26, in the New York Times, there was a story that ran on page A-11, detailing the admissions of Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. In the course of that article, and in another published in the American Medical News dated March 3, Mr. Fitzsimmons admits to lying, `through [his] teeth,' during his defense of partial-birth abortions, when he said that the procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. 
`It made me physically ill' to make these statements, he said. `I told my wife the next day, `I can't do this again.' 
The lies he admitted to focus on three major issues about partial-birth abortion, which is a terrible procedure, a late-term child being pulled out, mostly delivered, turned over, and then the abortion performed. 
The lies he admitted to focus on three major issues: No. 1, the number of these abortions performed annually in the United States; No. 2, the physical health of the mother and child involved; and, No. 3, the timing of the majority of partial-birth abortions. 
In an April 10, 1992, news conference announcing his veto of a ban on this procedure, H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, the President said, `This terrible problem affects a few hundred Americans every year.' And that has been continued to be claimed by a number of others. Yet, Mr. Fitzsimmons' admission is different. In the New York Times he now says the `procedure is performed far more often than his colleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women bearing healthy fetuses.' 
The Medical News story reports on an investigation done by the Record, a Bergen County, NJ, newspaper, and they stated this: 
The New Jersey paper reported last fall that physicians at one facility performed an estimated 3,000 abortions a year on fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks of which at least half are by intact D&E [dilation and evacuation]. One of the doctors was quoted as saying, `We have an occasional amnio abnormality, but it's a minuscule amount . . . most are for elective, not medical reasons; people who did not realize, or didn't care, how far along they were.' 
The Washington Post investigation turned up similar findings. 
I report that and put that forward here to the Senate, as this is an issue that is one of the front 10 Senate bills to face this body. It is a bill I hope we can act on. It is a bill, passed last year by both the House and Senate and vetoed by the President, to ban this late-term-abortion procedure, a procedure that is an abhorrent procedure, opposed by virtually all American people. Now we are finding out from some of the leading people advocating on the other side that they misrepresented--indeed, he said, `outright lied' about the number and the timeframe as to when these were performed. 
I hope we can move forward aggressively and quickly on banning this procedure in America. And I hope the President will reconsider, in light of these factual statements, in light of this information that is coming forward from particular people involved directly in the industry, and that he will sign the bill this year, when we pass this, to ban this horrendous procedure that has continued to be allowed in our civilized country. 
I commend all Senators to read this article that appeared yesterday in the New York Times, and the article I cited that is going to be appearing in the Medical News. I think it will add new light to this situation, and, hopefully, we can move forward, united, to take away this terrible situation that continues to happen in our country. 
With that I yield the floor.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the balanced budget constitutional amendment being considered before us today. In the House of Representatives, I was fortunate enough to have been involved with the passage of this amendment during the 104th Congress and I am honored to be active once again in our efforts to pass this important amendment, and to help secure the American dream for future generations. 
Now, proposing an amendment to our national charter is not something to be taken lightly. It should be undertaken only for the most important of causes. The Constitution has guaranteed and protected the freedom of the American people. But it can only continue to defend those freedoms if we give it the ability to defend them. An amendment to balance the budget will give our Constitution the strength it needs to continue protecting and defending the freedoms that so many Americans enjoy. 
A balanced budget promises hope for the future, not fear as the naysayers will tell you. It promises to draw down interest rates, spur new investment decisions and increase our gross domestic product. It promises lower unemployment and more take home pay. And very importantly it promises to help protect our Social Security system. 
Without it our economic security is threatened. One of the most insidious aspects of our budget deficit is that it amounts to a hidden tax on our income, and on our children's future income. This hidden tax is felt by everyone who has taken a loan to pay for school, buy a car, or purchase a home. Higher interest rates are the taxes levied by a government that has not the courage to live responsibly or even honestly. We must balance the budget and thereby eliminate this hidden tax. 
The Joint Economic Committee estimates, and you have heard the estimates before, but I think they bear repeating, that yearly savings on an $80,000 home mortgage would amount to $1,272 by balancing the budget and that a student fresh out of school paying back a student loan would save about $180 per year because of the lower interest rates. These are not illusory effects or empty promises; they are rather the assurances of a responsible Government that balances its budget year after year and pays down the debt. 
But the Keynesian apostles will tell you the economy will collapse in tough times with a balanced budget amendment because it could force Congress to take actions that could exacerbate a recession. They are wrong. 
Opponents of the amendment before us argue that deficit spending is sometimes necessary to offset the negative effects of a recession, natural disaster, or war and to ease the flow of the business cycle. Now, they would argue that during tough times the Government should deficit spend and borrow against future prosperity. But this is simply the wrong approach. Future prosperity is our children's prosperity, and it should never be leveraged to provide for the consumptive desires of big Government. 
This amendment would not force Congress to raise taxes during a recession. 
Our fiscal policy over the last 40 years has hinged on the desire to deficit spend during times of both recession and expansion. So those who claim this amendment would place a straitjacket on our Nation's fiscal policies are correct. It would place a straitjacket on bad fiscal policies by placing emphasis on less Government spending rather than more. 
Deficit spending exacerbates the Federal debt, crowds out private investment decisions that bolster the economy, and leverages the country out of future economic growth and prosperity. 
We must balance the budget by cutting taxes, the right taxes, and Government spending, cutting that. 
So why are the opponents of this measure trying to stop the balanced budget amendment? 
Because, as a matter of economic policy this amendment means an end to the tax and spend economics that has given us our bloated, centralized Federal Government. What it boils down to is this: This amendment will help us put our fiscal house in order by ending faulty Keynesian policy and freeing up private enterprise and encouraging entrepreneurship. What works in America is the individual creativity and ingenuity of our people. This amendment will give us the tool to help realize that truth. 
Unfortunately, the fear-mongering attempts by the administration have been focused on transforming this debate from a debate about hope and future prosperity to a debate about an imagined fiscal doomsday. They want to continue following the failed Keynesian policies that have produced the most massive peacetime debt in our Nation's history and they know that this amendment will not allow them to do that. 
Now, I have a chart of what has happened to our Nation's debt over the course of our country's short history. I think it is pretty interesting and telling. You can tell that in earlier times we would hold a major debt during times of war, such as during the Revolutionary War, when we had a high debt in this country. During the Civil War, we had a high debt. Certainly, during World War I and World War II, we had a high debt in this country. But then when you look at between the times of war, we virtually didn't have any debt at all, or we pushed it down--up until the past 30 years. Instead, during this period of time, we have increased our debt into the massive debt that we have today. 
Mr. President, there is no reason for this debt that exists today. It has been fiscally irresponsible, morally irresponsible. It is a debt, a burden, a mortgage on America that our children will have to pay off. It is morally wrong of us to do that. This balanced budget amendment will keep this from happening in the future, so that future generations, future children coming into this country, won't be burdened with this tax on them, a tax which they never even voted on. 
Yesterday morning, when I walked into my office, the national debt was $5,325,298,771,668.63. This morning, when I walked into the office, the national debt was calculated at $5,325,967,417,901.67. Now, that means that, while America worked yesterday, its commitment to paying off the debt increased by almost $670 million. 
Mr. President, that was actually a cheap day for what we are running here lately. Every day that the Senate debates this issue, the average increase in our debt has been a $694 million. So we actually had a good day yesterday. But it's still a $694 million increase per day. Every day we debate this issue, the debt of our Federal Government grows. 
Wait, let's talk about it in real terms, per person. Statistics compiled by the Tax Foundation indicate that the median dual-income family pays a little over $15,000 in Federal taxes each year. That means that over 46,000 families will have to work the entire year just to pay for the time we spend debating this amendment today alone. That is money that could have been spent to send a child to college, or to make a downpayment on a home. 
I want to talk about it in more personal terms, about Bud Hentzen of Wichita, KS, and his family and what they are going to owe for interest on the national debt. Bud is a proud family man. He has 10 children. He also has 30 grandchildren. He did a calculation, and he was a little nervous about this. He is proud of his children and grandchildren, as well. He wants to leave them a better and brighter future. He has worked hard all his life to provide for his children and for their future. He wants his country to be strong for them in the future. While he personally has been responsible for providing for those children and educating them, he looks at his Federal Government and calculates that his 10 children collectively owe over $700,000, and his 30 grandchildren collectively owe over $4.8 million for a total of over $5.5 million just to pay the interest on the debt for the Bud Hentzen family. 
That is not right. That is not what we are sent here to do. That is certainly not what Bud Hentzen would want us to do. He told me that the only thing he could tell them about the national debt was, `I am sorry we left you this debt.' Well, so am I. We ought to be more than sorry--we should be ashamed. 
This story makes it clear that this debate is about our children and their future. And it is about the immorality of our present system and whether or not we have the courage to change it for the better. 
Yet, opponents also claim that Congress does not need a balanced budget constitutional amendment in order to achieve balance. It simply needs courage. Well, our recent history proves that this claim is false. This argument is dubious because it admits that opponents of this amendment are motivated by political expediency, not true reform. For should the importance of a balanced budget disappear from the mind of America, the pressure to 
balance the budget would likely disappear from the minds of Members of Congress and the Senate. We are here to debate an issue of national importance that the march of time cannot and should not erode. This debate is not about the political whim of the day, it is about the economic future of our country. Let us then bind ourselves not by the political culture of the day, but by the resolve to complete the work we have started. 
The time to act is now. We must not betray our duty to our children and grandchildren, to Bud Hentzen's children and grandchildren, by failing to act on an issue that is so important. 
It is a moral imperative that we balance the budget and that we further give ourselves the tools we will need. How will future generations judge us if we have not the strength to end this practice of spending our children's inheritance for the sake of big Government? No doubt, when the pages of history have spoken, the debate we are herein engaged will be remembered not by the shrillness of the rhetoric, but by the consequences of our action. May those consequences enrich our Constitution, defend our freedoms, and protect our children. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] joins with me today in offering this bill to address an injustice that has developed out of current law. 
Under current law, commercial air carriers are prohibited from providing service between Dallas' Love Field and points located outside of Texas or its four surrounding States. This effectively limits travel into and out of this airport to destinations only in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and New Mexico. Flights originating from any other State must fly into the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in order to have access to the highly traveled Dallas area. 
The original intent of the Wright amendment was to protect the then relatively new Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. It is now the third busiest airport in the country and no longer needs to be protected from competition. The amendment distorts the free market and condones anticompetitive law; it also limits travel and forces passengers to pay artificially and unreasonably high airfare. Furthermore, it causes unnecessary delay and inconvenience for passengers, especially the disabled, elderly, and those traveling with small children. Finally, Dallas is the top destination for passengers flying from Wichita and this restriction denies Kansas lower fares. 
This restriction not based on any standards appropriate for the airline industry. It is not based on mileage flown, size of the city serviced, or noise generated by the aircraft. Instead, it is an outdated restriction based on political boundaries which were in place before the advent of airplanes. 
As a law that is based on political concerns rather than practical realities, this is a prime example of unwarranted and unnecessary government regulation. It is a prime example of a lack of common sense and it is a prime example of why so many Americans have lost confidence in their Government. 
The Wright amendment is wrong for America, and I urge my colleagues to join me in correcting this biased situation.

It is a tremendous honor, privilege, and responsibility to do so. I am delighted to be speaking on the U.S. Senate floor for the first time about balancing the budget and about the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which I feel is basically very important and critical for future generations. Now is the time for us to act and to address not just the financial health of our country, but also the freedom of our children and grandchildren, by passing the balanced budget constitutional amendment.

Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it is with regret that I announce that today I will be voting in opposition to the nomination of William M. Daley to the position of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce. While Mr. Daley's character and his distinguished career in public service demonstrate that he has the qualifications for the position to which he has been nominated, these qualifications are necessary, but in and of themselves, not sufficient to merit my vote. 
My chief concerns regarding Mr. Daley's suitability for the position reflect: First, questions over his willingness and commitment to deal with corporate welfare in the agency; and second, his commitment to engage in the fundamental overhaul of a Department whose management practices and many missions have been called into question by numerous reports by the Department's inspector general and by the General Accounting Office. 
Corporate welfare has no place in this Government today. Mr. Daley generally agrees we should not have corporate welfare in the Federal Government. However, he disagrees with the appropriate definition of corporate welfare. I asked repeatedly for a specific commitment from him to study whether corporate welfare was being doled out by the agency. He was unwilling to do so, although he made a similar commitment with respect to the issue of foreign trips conducted by the agency. 
My second concern is the redundancies at the Department of Commerce. According to a recent GAO study the Department of Commerce functions are duplicated 71 times throughout the Federal Government. I discussed this problem with Mr. Daley during the hearing. He stated that he would consider the issue, but made no specific commitments as to when he would address the issue nor in what quantity. He would not commit to report to Congress within 6 months or 1 year on these known redundancies nor would he commit to cutting back the number of redundancies by a minimum of even 10 percent. He did make such specific commitments regarding political appointees, which he agreed to reduce by 100. 
Because Mr. Daley has refused to make specific commitments to address these problems I do not support his nomination. The next Secretary of Commerce should be someone who recognizes the seriousness of these problems, and who is committed to addressing them.
